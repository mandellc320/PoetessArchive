                  <gloss> Joanna Baillie stands as the most significant Romantic period
							British woman playwright as well as being one of the period"s most
							notable women critics. Scottish by birth, Baillie moved about with her
							family after her father's death until her brother inherited a
							London medical practice from his uncle. Eventually settling in
							Hampstead, Baillie widened her circle of literary acquaintances to
							include numerous prominent figures. Her own first publication was an
							anonymous volume, <hi rendition="#italics">
                        <title>Poems: Wherein It Is

							(1798), with its "<title>Introductory Discourse</title>," was
							also published anonymously, sparking much speculation about the author.
							Baillie added additional volumes to this work in 1802 and 1812, with
							this final volume featuring the preface "<title>To the
								Reader</title>." Another collection, <hi rendition="#italics">
                        <title>Miscellaneous Plays</title>
                     </hi>, appeared in 1804 and

                        <title>De

                        <title>Dramas</title>
                     </hi> appeared. Along with

                     </hi>, examining the nature and dignity of

							d'etat, assuming the title of First Consul of the French Republic.
							In 1804 he was crowned Emperor of France, leading the French to military
							conquest over most of Europe. He reigned as Emperor until April 1814,
							when he was forced by the allied European armies to abdicate. Exiled to
							the Mediterranean island of Elba, he remained only until his escape in
							February 1815, when he returned to France to resume his title of
							Emperor. In June of that year he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo
							and exiled once again, this time to the Atlantic island of Saint Helena,
							where he remained until his death. His legacy is mixed; he was
							responsible for extensive modernizing reform in France, and the
							Napoleonic Code widely influenced the legal systems of many nations. On
							the other hand, his ambition for world power seemed inexhaustible and
							his campaigns were often marked by extraordinary devastation and cruelty
							towards non-combatants, including women and children. Napoleon's
							battle strategies are still studied in military schools today.

                  <gloss>Poet and novelist Charlotte Turner Smith provides an unusual example
							of a Romantic period woman who began as a coterie poet, but out of
							necessity became a professional writer. Charlotte Turner was born into a
							well-to-do family, but after the early death of her mother, she was
							consigned first to the care of an aunt, then to boarding school. Soon
							after she reached her teens, her father remarried, and having thus
							become an inconvenience, Charlotte was married off at the age of fifteen
							to the dissipated, unfaithful, and violent Benjamin Smith, who kept the
							family perpetually in debt and with whom she ultimately bore twelve
							children. The groom's father clearly understood his son's
							nature, for at his death he left a significant fortune specifically for
							his daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The will was so complex, however,
							that the money was tied up in litigation until after both Charlotte and
							her husband were dead and the children matured. In the meantime,
							Smith's husband was consigned to prison for debt, where she joined
							him, there composing poetry for sale in an attempt to relieve their
							financial distress. The result was <hi rendition="#italics">
                        <title>Elegiac Sonnets, and Other Essays</title>
                     </hi> (1784),
							which was revised and enlarged numerous times until 1797 and eventually
							included prefatory essays that delineate principles of sonnet
							composition. Though she separated from her husband soon after, Smith
							continued to support herself, her children, and to some extent her
							estranged spouse through her writing. She first tried translating, and
							then in 1788 she published her first novel, <hi rendition="#italics">
