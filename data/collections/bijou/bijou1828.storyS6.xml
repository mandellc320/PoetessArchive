            <p>IT is hardly necessary to remind the reader that at the close of the Peninsular war
               orders were issued for the formation of an encampment in the neighbourhood of
               Bourdeaux, where the regiments which had been selected to reinforce Sir George
               Prevost in Canada, as well as to carry on hostilities along the shores of the United
               States, might assemble. It fell to the lot of the **** regiment of light infantry to
               form one of the corps appointed for the last-mentioned of these services. Having been
               attached to the left column of Lord Wellington's army we were stationed, when the
               above intelligence reached us, under the walls of Bayonne, at the distance of ten
               long day's march from the point of rendezvous; but we welcomed the communication with
               not less alacrity on that account, and <pb n="149" xml:id="image186"/>made ready, on
               the 14th May, 1814, to act in accordance with its tenor.</p>
            <p>Of the particulars of our journey I am not at present called upon to give any
               account, farther than that in all its stages, and in every circumstance connected
               with it, it was most delightful. The weather chanced to be peculiarly favorable. Not
               a shower of rain, or a blast of wind, overtook us during the whole of our progress;
               and though towards noon the heat usually became more oppressive than agreeable, we
               managed by starting every day an hour or two before sun-rise, to escape most of the
               inconveniences which might have otherwise affected us. Every thing moreover, animate
               and inanimate which came in our way, had about it an air of exquisite novelty. The
               costume and personal appearance of the people, the arrangement of their houses,
               fields, vineyards and gardens, the order of their domestic life, were to us perfectly
               new, and interesting. We struck into the Landes, on the morning of the third day, and
               if any of my readers have happened to visit that wild district, he will doubtless
               attest that one more singular, or more prolific in extraordinary spectacles, has
               seldom been pressed by the foot of a traveller [sic].</p>
            <p>Amidst the huge forests of pine which overspread the whole face of this region, there
               are scattered at wide intervals from one another, a few villages, or rather hamlets,
               remarkable for their extreme beauty, <pb n="150" xml:id="image187"/>and for the air
               of primitive simplicity and contentment which hangs over them. They consist, for the
               most part, of from ten to twenty cottages, the walls of which are composed entirely
               of wood, and the roofs uniformly covered with straw. Each stands apart in the centre
               of its own neat garden and enclosure, whilst to the distance of perhaps a quarter of
               a mile in every direction, a circle of cultivated fields encompasses the whole. It
               rarely happens that a stream of limpid and excellent water is wanting in the
               vicinity, and a church, suited to the humble charactor [sic] of its simple
               worshippers, was a conspicuous feature in every one of the hamlets that lay along the
               line of our march.</p>
            <p>The quarter-master-general had so arranged our route that we were every day enabled,
               after compassng [sic] a sufficient extent of ground, to encamp in the neighbourhood
               of one or other of these delightful villages. The inhabitants proved in all
               instances, as obliging, as their poverty and secluded course of existence authorised
               us to expect; and if the women were not always remarkable for personal beauty they
               were, at all events, invariably goodnatured [sic], and lively. It happened that on
               one occasion I had my feelings wrought upon to a degree beyond my anticipations; and
               as the affair appeared at the moment worthy of being noted down, perhaps even now it
               may be deemed not undeserving of mention.</p>
            <pb n="151" xml:id="image188"/>
            <p>The night of Saturday the 21st of May, having been spent in the village of St. Muret,
               at two o'clock on Sunday morning, our tents were struck and we were in motion. Our
               route lat, as usual during the preceding week over a deep sandy track, cut through
               the heart of a dreary pine-wood, and our journey, on account of the absence of a
               convenient spot for halting, proved to be particularly tedious and fatiguing. We had
               traversed something more than six leagues; the hour of noon was past, and the heat
               had become intense, when a sort of shout uttered at the head of the column gave
               notice, that a resting place was in view. The shout did not deceive us. The leading
               files had already emerged from the wood into the customary range of open country; and
               in little more than half an hour afterwards our camp was pitched in one [sic] the
               loveliest situations which it had occupied since the commencement of our
               progress.</p>
            <p>Unlike its fellow-hamlets, La Barbp the village, beside which we now halted did not
               stand in the midst of an extensive area of bare meadows, and low corn-fields. Meadows
               and corn-fields there doubtless were but their surfaces were beautifully diversified
               by the frequent interspersion of clumps of oaks and chesnuts [sic]; whilst numerous
               undulations in the ground produced a species of tasteful irregularity, which gave to
               the little landscape the <pb n="152" xml:id="image189"/> appearance, rather of a
               park, or gentleman's enclosure, than of lands portioned out into fourteen or fifteen
               different farms. A rivulet of the purest water issued from the forest upon the right,
               and flowing gently onwards, wound round the base of a green hill, upon which, about a
               stone's throw apart from the other buildings, was erected the village church. In the
               village itself I saw nothing to distinguish it from the others. It consisted as usual
               of wooden cottages, not one of which, in point of architecture or decorations could
               claim a superiority over the others. And even the very cure or vicarage, if such it
               deserved to be called, was nothing more than a cabin, clean and neat, indeed, but
               presenting the lowliest aspect.</p>
            <p>Every body [sic] knows, that Sunday is observed in a French village as a day, not of
               relaxation only, but of jubilee. We therefore found the villagers in their best
               attire, assembled on the green or common, round which their cottages stood; and as
               they came forward in a body to bid us welcome, they presented upon the whole, a very
               striking and picturesque appearance. The men were conspicuous for their jackets of
               coarse brown cloth, their grey or brown breeches, blue stockings and large wooden
               shoes, but it was in the garb of the women that the distinction paid to Sunday might
               be most readily <pb n="153" xml:id="image190"/>noted. The boddice [sic] laced up with
               blue or scarlet ribbon; the bright scarlet petticoat, made so scanty as to display
               the scarlet clock [sic] which ornamented the blue stocking, these, with the
               handkerchief tied round the head with more than ordinary care and neatness, gave
               intimation that the toilette for that day always occupied much time, and particular
               attention. All, however, seemed to enjoy the same excellent flow of spirits, and not
               a few of the younger had gladly availed themselves of our band, to continue the
               dancing which our approach had interrupted.</p>
            <p>As soon as the bustle of encamping came to a close, I directed my steps towards the
               church, with the design of joining in the devotions of these simple people, or at
               least, of offering up my own orisons, from within consecrated walls. In this,
               however, I was disappointed; the priest, it appeared, officiated at another village
               besides La Barbp, taking the one in the morning, and the other in the evening,
               alternately; and as on this day, divine service had been performed here in the
               morning, it would not be repeated. Though a little chagrined at this circumstance I
               nevertheless followed up my original design so far, as to take a hasty survey of the
               interior of the pile; and then proceeded to indulge a favourite whim, by strolling
               leisurely <pb n="154" xml:id="image191"/>through the humble cemetery by which it was
               surrounded.</p>
            <p>I found the churchyard moderately studded with green mounds, but wholly devoid of
               head-stones or columns to tell the names of the persons who slept beneath. Wooden
               crosses seemed to be the only species of monument erected by the people of La Barbp
               to the memory of their deceased relatives, and of these, though they were almost as
               numerous as the graves themselves, not one bore a word or letter of inscription. Even
               the garlands, which throughout most parts of France it is customary for the survivors
               to twine over the tombs of those whom they loved, were all, with a solitary
               exception, wanting here. Upon one cross, and one only, hung a wreath of flowers; and
               though the blackened hue of the wood told a tale of exposure to more than one summer
               and winter, the garland was fresh and fragrant, as if gathered and arranged this very
               morning. I was much struck with the contrast which the condition of this grave, as
               compared with the others, presented, and, sitting down, was beginning to give free
               vent to fancy, when the noise of approaching footsteps disturbed my reverie. I looked
               round, and beheld, advancing towards me, a man in the common garb of the country. His
               age seemed to be about three or four and thirty; but in his general appearance there
                  <pb n="155" xml:id="image192"/>was nothing at all remarkable except that an
               upright carriage, one empty sleeve, and a pair of monstrous mustachios, indicated
               that he had been a soldier, and had served in the memorable wars of his country. As
               he drew nearer, however, I examined him more closely, and observed, or fancied so, a
               peculiarly mild and even melancholy expression in his eye. Whether or not I was
               correct, little time was granted to consider, for he raised his hand to his hat and
               coming forward at once, with the freedom and frankness of his country entered with me
               into conversation.</p>
            <p>"I perceive, Monsieur," said he, "that the garland upon the cross which distinguishes
               this grave from those around it, has attracted your attention." I assented to his
               remark, and proceeded to inquire whether he could give me any information respecting
               the individual who had suspended it there, and the person to whose memory it was
               consecrated. "I can indeed, sir," answered he; "I can satisfy you fully on both these
               heads; it was I that gathered it, it was I that wove it, and it was I that hung it
               here; it is a task which I religiously perform on the return of every Sunday morning,
               and she to whom I dedicate my weekly offerings, was the best, as she was the
               loveliest maiden of the province. Perhaps you may desire to learn something of her
               history. If you will allow me to take the privilege of a brother soldier I <pb n="156" xml:id="image193"/>can sit down beside you; and God help me, I shall
               derive as much satisfaction, though it be a melancholy one from relating the brief
               detail, as you can have from listening to it." I immediately, and with the utmost
               readiness, accepted his proposal, upon which the villager seated himself by my side,
               and began as follows:</p>
            <p>"I am a native of this place, as from my address and dialect you have doubtless
               already guessed. My name is Jean Baptiste, and my father, whose only child I am, is
               accounted the wealthiest and most skillful cultivator in all the department. You may
               perceive that bating the loss of this arm (and that occurred six years ago, ought not
               to tell against me), I am neither worse made, nor less personally attractive than my
               neighbours; whilst I can appeal to all that know me, whether my temper be not as
               mild, and my disposition as amiable, as those of any lad in these parts."</p>
            <p>I could not suppress a smile at this most characteristic display of French egotism.
               "Why Jean," said, laughing, "I thought you were going to tell me a tale connected
               with the fair tenant of this grave; but you seem more disposed to instruct me
               concerning your own good qualities and fortunes." "Ah! Monsieur," replied he, "you
               may smile if you please, and say on that point what you will; but <pb n="157" xml:id="image194"/> believe me I speak the truth. Yet what availed all these
               advantages. Marie, the beautiful and gentle Marie, whom I loved with my whole heart,
               and to promote whose happiness I could have willingly sacrificed my life, would not
               listen to my suit. It is a fact, indeed it is, she slighted my accomplishments,
               undervalued my wealth, and preferred to me a poor neighbour, who had nothing to
               recommend him, that I, at least, could discover, except that he was of a less fair
               complexion, and possessed a tolerable share of bodily strength and activity. Well,
               well, I could not quarrel with the girl for that, nor yet forsake my friend because
               he supplanted me, for Lewis Charmont was my friend, and dear to me as my own
               soul.</p>
            <p>"It is hardly necessary to inform you, that La Barbp has been inhabited by the
               ancestors of those families which inhabit it now, since the day when the good saint
               first planted these forests, and stayed the sands from moving. Under these
               circumstances you will not be surprised to learn, that we are all accustomed to
               regard one another as brothers and sisters, and that the poorest man amongst us is
               not despised or treated as an inferior, by the richest. But though this be, and has
               ever been the case, it is still only natural that even in our small community
               particular friendships should bind individuals more closely to each other, than the
               tie of common regard which <pb n="158" xml:id="image195"/>binds the same individuals
               to the whole body. Such has long been the case with the Charmonts, the Clausels, and
               the Baptistes. Our ancestors loved one another from the remotest period; no change in
               worldly circumstances ever interfered with their feelings; our parents were as if
               they had descended from the same stock; and we *** I mean Lewis, Marie and myself ***
               inherited their attachment.</p>
            <p>"Lewis Charmont was by one year only, my junior; Marie Clausel was two years younger
               than he. From the very cradle we were companions and playmates; nay were more, ***
               Lewis was the brother of my adoption, and Marie was our sister. Ah! Monsieur, those
               were blessed days, when each holding a hand, we led the sweet girl forth towards the
               river, and seating her on the bank the one plied his rod and line, whilst the other
               chased the butterfly which she admired, or wove a wreath of wild flowers for her fair
               brow. But childhood passed away, and youth came, to make us acquainted with the true
               state of our feelings, and to teach us that we were rivals. We both loved Marie,
               loved her to absolute idolatry; yet we loved each other at the same time, and never,
               no not for an instant did a pang of angry jealousy rankle in our hearts.</p>
            <p> "As we approached to manhood, Lewis and I, differing widely in our propensities and
               pursuits became by degrees not less truly friends, but less fre-<pb n="159" xml:id="image196"/>quently companions. Lewis was agile, daring and adventurous;
               field sports, violent bodily exertions, especially where danger was to be surmounted
               or difficulties overcome, carried him away from his home, and the operations of
               agriculture; whereas my habits and tastes were all quiet and domestic. I cultivated
               my father's fields, contentedly and cheerfully, and was never so happy, as when I
               found leisure to dress Marie's garden, and stock it with the rarest and choicest
               plants within my reach. Yet for all this, she rejected my addresses: she withdrew
               not, indeed, from my society, but she refused to listen to my vows, and her refusal
               was so mildly and so affectionately pronounced that I only loved her the more because
               I felt my suit was hopeless. The truth is, Monsieur, that her affections were already
               engaged. She preferred to me, (who was continually at her side,) him who bestowed but
               a small portion of his time or attention upon her; but spent whole days, and
               sometimes nights in the woods, only that he might bring home and present to her the
               head of a wolf or the skin of a bear.</p>
            <p>"In this condition affairs continued for some time. We never dreamed of concealing
               from each other how our affections were disposed of; on the contrary Lewis was all
               along aware that I loved Marie tenderly, and I was equally aware that Lewis loved her
               also; yet that either was preferred by her to the <pb n="160" xml:id="image197"/>other we both continued ignorant, till an accident drew forth the secret.</p>
            <p>"Early in the year 908, there arrived in our village a sub-officer's party of
               Gendarmerie, bearing an order from the prefect of the department, to enrol [sic] four
               young men from the division of La Barbp, for the service of the army. Such an order,
               coming from such a quarter, could neither be disputed nor evaded; the names of all
               the villagers capable of bearing arms, were put into a cap, and that of Lewis
               Charmont came up. Lewis himself, naturally brave and enterprising, uttered no
               complaint against his fortune, but rather rejoiced, in the prospect of honor and
               advancement. Lewis continued as yet ignorant of the possession of Marie's affections,
               for though repeatedly urged, she had hitherto refused to acknowledge it, though now,
               however, concealment was at an end. A threatening separation effected that which
               years of intimacy and familiar intercourse had failed to effect; and in the
               bitterness of her agony she yielded a full confession. I was present when she assured
               him, that she lived for him and him alone; that his departure would be to her a blow
               which she could not survive; that she would not even desire to exist, did he abandon
               her. What could I do. I saw indeed that my own hopes were blighted, and that Marie's
               coldness sprang not from indifference, but from a positive predilec-<pb n="161" xml:id="image198"/>tion for another. But that other was my friend; Marie I still
               loved as before; could I be contented to behold this misery! No, Monsieur, though
               naturally averse to a life of bustle and contention I determined on the instant, to
               volunteer in Lewis's room, I did so without so much as consulting him, and was
               accepted.</p>
            <p>"Not all the misery which in my quieter hours has followed up the reflection that
               Marie was lost to me for ever [sic]; not all the grief which was my lot when I
               committed her delicate form to the earth, have been able to efface the blessed
               recollection of the moment when the flushed cheek, and glittering eye I told her that
               her lover was free, and that they might thenceforth be happy together. Ah! Monsieur,
               that was indeed a moment of rapture, of rapture such as I shall never again
               experience when I heard her address me as her brother and preserver; when I felt her
               arms around my neck, and her warm tears upon my cheek, and received the sweetest and
               most rapturous kiss that the lip of woman ever bestowed! Oh! whole years of agony
               could not suffice to blot out the recollection of those moments; a life of pain were
               but a poor price to offer for their repossession! But they passed away; and I marched
               off, if not happy, at all events, satisfied that I had done my duty, and that there
               were two kind hearts which <pb n="162" xml:id="image199"/>beat in gratitude for me,
               whose own was little better than a blank.</p>
            <p>"My satisfaction was, however, but of short duration. I had sojourned but a few weeks
               at the dépôt, when the arrival of Lewis, as one of a fresh batch of conscripts, gave
               proof that the sacrifice which I had made had been to no purpose. A second call for
               recruits, it appeared, produced a second ballot; and the name of Lewis, as if heaven
               had decreed that he should not elude his destiny, was again among the number of the
               drawn. You may well believe that my friend for some time after his enlistment was
               melancholy enough, when I inform you that the very day was named which ought to have
               made Marie his own; yet he recovered his spirits by degrees, applied steadily to his
               drill and his duty, and bore himself as proudly, and was as much admired as any man
               in the ranks, when the detachment began its march to join the army in Spain.</p>
            <p>"Lewis and I were fortunate enough to be appointed to the same corps, and the same
               company, indeed we were comrades. We were fortunate too in being commanded by a brave
               and good officer; and to fill up our measure of good luck, were sent off to serve
               under one of the ablest and most humane generals whom France has produced. We were
               ordered to Catalonia, at that time the province of the gallant and <pb n="163" xml:id="image200"/>generous St. Cyr. This happy combination of events naturally
               tended to make us look to the future with a less desponding gaze, and upon the past
               with greater resignation; we acknowledged that our lot might have been far less
               desirable, and we were contented.</p>
            <p>"No particular events befel [sic] us on our journey towards the frontier. On the
               whole, we were treated with sufficient consideration by the inhabitants, who bestowed
               on us a thousand wishes for our success and safe return, and we came up with the army
               just as it had taken its ground, and begun to make preparations for the siege of
               Rosas. You are, doubtless, aware, that the defence made by the garrison of that
               fortress was exceedingly obstinate and gallant. Though our trenches were gradually
               drawn to the very crest of the glacis, and our saps penetrated the escarpment, the
               governor refused to surrender; nothing therefore remained but to try the fortune of
               an assault, and for this perilous service volunteers were invited to offer.</p>
            <p>"The first man who presented himself on that occasion was Lewis Charmont. It was in
               vain that I reminded him of Marie, and of the necessity under which he lay of
               guarding his life, as far as circumstances would allow, for her sake. He only smiled
               at my remonstrance, and squeezing my hand, replied, that if he fell, Marie would
               honor his memory, and if he survived, he should be the more worthy of her, as <pb n="164" xml:id="image201"/>he would have acted like a brave man, and earned a
               medal.</p>
            <p>"The assault took place, and was successful. The carnage on both sides was terrible,
               but the town fell, and Lewis escaped unhurt. That I rejoiced at his escape you will,
               I am sure, believe; yet let me be candid, I did envy him, for the first and only time
               in my life, when I beheld him next morning upon parade with the medal already
               suspended from his button. Bitterly did I upbraid myself that I had not volunteered
               also; and I resolved that he should never again earn a distinction to which I should
               not be equally entitled; nor was I without hope that even Rosas might be to me, as it
               had been to him, a theatre of renown. The citadel still held out, principally, I
               believe, through the exertions of your countryman, Lord Cochrane, and a few of his
               sailors; and it continued for many days to withstand all our efforts. I was one of
               those who thrice endeavoured to storm it, and were thrice repulsed; but the works
               were demolished at last by cannon shot, the English were compelled to abandon them,
               and we took possession of the ruins.</p>
            <p>"Worn out with the labours of a tedious and harassing siege, we fondly looked
               forward, now that the place had fallen, to the enjoyment of at least a few days of
               repose, but we were disappointed. The critical situation of Barcelona, at that period
               blockaded by the <pb n="165" xml:id="image202"/>enemy, called upon the general to
               make every effort for its preservation. It was by far the most important of all our
               possessions on that coast, for the loss of which hardly any success would have
               compensated; so St. Cyr having determined that it should not change masters through
               any negligence on his part, made ready, without a moment's delay, to succour it. On
               the evening of the day which saw our flag hoisted upon the ramparts of Rosas, the
               order to prepare was issued, and at an early hour next morning the whole army was in
               motion.</p>
            <p>"The direct road from Rosas to Barcelona leads, you must know, under the very guns of
               Hostalrech, a fortified town, which was then held by a numerous Spanish garrison.
               Conscious that any effort to force a passage must be attended by a heavy loss, and
               unwilling to waste time by reducing the fort, St. Cyr resolved to penetrate, as he
               best could, through the mountain; and having found a shepherd who professed to be
               acquainted with the different tracks, he took him for his guide. The man was no
               traitor. He conducted the column, by a difficult and circuitous route, round the hill
               upon which Hostalrech is built, and brought it in safety, after a perilous and
               fatiguing march, once more into the high road.</p>
            <p>"On this occasion Lewis Charmont and myself were both attached to the rear-guard. It
               was not very efficient in point of numbers, though the general was<pb n="166" xml:id="image203"/>pleased to say that we were all brave men, on whom he could
               perfectly depend; and it came not off so well as the column which it was appointed to
               protect. During the earlier part of the day, indeed, we, like those in front of us,
               went on without beholding an enemy; but about four o'clock in the afternoon we
               suddenly found ourselves watched by a very superior force; which, in spite of our
               most strenuous efforts to prevent it, succeeded in throwing itself between us and the
               rear of the column. For and instant we fell back, as if uncertain what course to
               pursue; the main body, we were well aware, would not, and could not halt to succour
               us, they could not even spare reinforcements to bring us off, for the defile of
               Trientepasos was before them, which must be passed that night or never; there was,
               therefore, no help to be expected from that quarter. The idea of surrendering, whilst
               we had arms in our hands, could not be borne for a moment; more especially as we were
               not ignorant that he who became a prisoner to the Spaniards was less to be envied
               than his comrade who fell in battle. Though they exceeded us in numbers by four to
               one, we resolved to fight our way through them, and either to make good our passage,
               or perish in the attempt.</p>
            <p>"The Spaniards were advantageously posted on the brow of a wooded height, and galled
               us dreadfully, as we rushed on, with their fire, but our charge <pb n="167" xml:id="image204"/>was decisive; for one instant they stood the shock, in the next
               we had pierced them. And now all was hurry and confusion; it was our business to
               escape, each man as he was best able, and we were not very scrupulous as to the
               means. We ran as fast as weariness would permit, preserving, however, for a time an
               irregular line, and stopping occasionally, as a convenient space offered, to check
               the pursuit by our fire; but at last even our skirmishing order was lost, and we fled
               and fought in files or singly, as chance or circumstances directed.</p>
            <p>"In this manner the tiraillading continued till hardly light enough remained for us
               to point our muskets, when Lewis, who throughout the whole affaire had kept by my
               side, fell to the ground. You will wonder when I tell you, that notwithstanding the
               situation in which we were placed, it never once occurred to me that my friend could
               be wounded; I imagined that he had merely lost his footing, and I stooped down, in
               the careless turn of mind which such a belief was calculated to create, in order to
               assist him in rising. What then were my sensations when I found that he made no reply
               to my inquiries, and on examining him more closely, discovered that a musket ball had
               struck him just where the shoulder joins the neck, and passed into his vitals. My
               very brain swam round, yet I retained self-command sufficient to raise him in my
               arms, and to entreat that he <pb n="168" xml:id="image205"/>would exert his utmost
               strength, as the fire was fast slackening. He did so, and I led him to the rear; but
               we had not proceeded a dozen paces before he exclaimed in a feeble voice, 'It is
               useless, Baptiste, I cannot proceed farther. Go, go you, save yourself for poor
               Marie, and leave me to die.' I could not act thus, Monsieur; it was not in my nature
               to abandon any one, more especially the friend of my heart, under these
               circumstances; so partly carrying, and partly dragging, I contrived to hurry him
               along, till a cottage opportunely offering, I conveyed him into it. It was deserted
               and in ruins; yet with a winter's night closing rapidly upon us, I was too thankful
               even for such a shelter to pass it by.</p>
            <p>"The firing had now ceased; our people having made good their retreat, and the enemy
               fallen back to Hostalrech; but that was a matter about which I was perfectly
               regardless. I thought only of my friend, for whom the plundered hut afforded no
               comforts, and but a very partial shelter. I laid him upon the mud floor, and tearing
               my handkerchief into shreds, attempted to staunch the blood which welled from his
               broken limb; but all my efforts were fruitless, it flowed in spite of them. When I
               looked at his countenance, too, that told me plainly enough that there was no hope;
               the half-closed eye and fallen jaw, not less than the pale lit and livid cheek,
               warned me that Lewis was departing. Wild with my own <pb n="169" xml:id="image206"/>fears, I called upon him in the name of Marie, and of all the tender associations
               connected with his native village, to rally himself, and take courage; and at last,
               finding that he paid no heed to my adjurations, I sat down beside him in despair,
               buried my face in my hands, and wept aloud. The sound of my lamentation reached him
               even in his last moments; he looked up, and in a tone scarcely audible, exclaimed,
               'Do not weep, Baptiste, do not weep, it must be thus, we must all die. Tell Marie
               that I fell as became me; and give her my medal, that she may occasionally look upon
               it, and remember me when I am gone. Tell her, likewise, that with my last breath I
               consigned her to you; you love her, Baptiste, that I know; and I need not add be kind
               to her, for to whom was my friend ever unkind? May you be happy together, and the
               thought that you are so *** .' He could not finish the sentence; no doubt he meant to
               say, that his spirit would look down upon our happiness with delight, but the word
               died upon his lips, the lips themselves ceased to move, and he was a corpse.</p>
            <p>"Ah, Monsieur, if you have ever known what it is to witness the dissolution of a
               friend who was dear to you as the air which you breathed, then, and then only, will
               you be able to imagine what my feelings were at this moment. Alas! I could not even
               pay to him the last tribute of friendship; I could not lay him in a grave; but I did
               what I could; I took his <pb n="170" xml:id="image207"/>medal from his breast, and
               fetching a quantity of straw from an adjoining chamber, I spread it over him; I knelt
               down, too, and breathed a fervent prayer for his soul's repose; and then with swollen
               eyes, and a heavy heart, set out to overtake my regiment.</p>
            <p>"I need not pursue the remainder of my story with any particular minuteness. I came
               up with the corps at the farther mouth of the defile, for the Spaniards, contrary to
               all expectation, had permitted us to thread it unmolested; and I partook of the
               bivouac which they had formed on the plain of Llenas. But our repose was of short
               continuance; the dawn had just begun to break when a heavy column showed itself in
               full march towards the pass; no doubt could exist as to the force which composed the
               column; so the drums beat to arms, and in five minutes after the army was in
               line.</p>
            <p>"Of the action which ensued, and which ended in the total defeat of the Spaniards, I
               cannot pretend to give any account, for the cannonade had scarcely begun when a round
               shot struck me in the left arm, and took it off. I was carried from the field along
               with hundreds besides, and having suffered amputation, was removed to a crowded
               hospital, where, during many weeks I endured all the misery attendant upon inadequate
               accommodation, imperfect nursing, and scanty provisions. At last, however, <pb n="171" xml:id="image208"/>thanks to a naturally good constitution, I recovered;
               and being no longer serviceable, I received my discharge, but no pension was allowed
               me; I had not served long enough, it appeared, to merit one; indeed I was left to
               make my way, as I best might, through the whole breadth of France, without receiving
               any assistance than that which private benevolence afforded. Thus mutilated, and a
               beggar, I reached my home exactly ten months from the day on which I quitted it.</p>
            <p>"And now, Monsieur, it only remains for me to repeat the saddest portion of my story.
               Poor Marie had received no account of her lover since he departed, and had pined and
               languished after him, like a bird robbed of her young. Her health, naturally
               delicate, was already impaired by suspense; how then could it be expected that she
               would bear up against the terrible reality; she did not, Monsieur. I broke the matter
               to her as delicately as I could, but even thus she was unable to bear it; the
               intelligence that Lewis was no more came upon her like a thunderbolt upon a bruised
               reed *** it crushed her. When I strove to cheer her by making mention of her lover's
               valour, her tears only flowed the faster; and when I pulled out his medal, and gave
               it to her as his last bequest, it seemed as if her heart would have broken. She took
               it, laid it upon her bosom, and to her dying day kept it there; nay, it was not
               removed from her even <pb n="172" xml:id="image209"/>in death, it is buried in her
               grave. No, no, Monsieur, I could not speak to one, thus afflicted, of new ties; I
               never told her that Lewis had bequeathed her to me. The poor stricken doe had no
               pasture to fly to; she lingered on for a while, and died.</p>
            <p>"Six years and a half have passed since we laid her in the dust; she had then barely
               completed her twenty-first year, and the merciful God never took to himself a purer
               or a chaster spirit. For me, it has ever since been my chief delight to deck her
               grave, as you see it even now. Every Sunday I gather fresh garland for the purpose;
               and as long as life remains, I will continue the practice."</p>
            <p>Though there was something French in this poor fellow's story, I was, upon the whole,
               a good deal affected by it; and deeming it not unworthy of a place in my scrap-book,
               I noted it down.</p>
