            <p>The few observations which are necessary to be prefixed to this volume, will contain
               little more than acknowledgements to the distinguished literary characters, and
               eminent artists whose respective productions adorn its pages; as it is on those
               productions the Publisher rests his hopes that it will be deemed entitled to an
               elevated station among the Annual publications, not of this country only, but of
               Europe.  Far from wishing, however, to institute invidious comparisons, he only
               assets for it an equal claim to the notice and patronage of the public; for whether
               with respect to its graphic illustrations, or its literary merits, he feels assured
               that it will not be found inferior to any, even if it does not excel most, of its
               contemporaries.</p>
            <p>To describe the Editor's obligations to this various friends in adequate terms would
               require space infinitely beyond that to which a preface is necessarily limited; but
               in briefly expressing his gratitude to the celebrated characters who have cheerfully
               afforded him the assistance of their talents, he will not only perform a grateful
               duty, but at the same time tacitly urge the pretensions which he considers "THE
               BIJOU" to possess to public favor.</p>
            <p>To sir Walter Scott the proprietors and himself <pb n="vi" xml:id="image015"/>are
               indebted for the interesting letter explanatory of the picture of his family, with an
               engraving of which, through the liberality of its possessor Sir Adam Ferguson, and
               the painter Mr. Wilkie, they have been able to enrich the Work.  Nor is it too much
               to expect that if every other recommendation were wanting, that plate, and still more
               the description by which it is accompanied would prove irresistable attractions to
               the world; for who can be indifferent to so pleasing a memorial of a writer to whose
               merits England, Europe, nay, the whole civilized world, has offered its homage and
               its praise.  Conspicuous as that letter is among the literary beauties of these
               sheets,—and to it may be attributed an interest as unfading as the reputation of its
               writer—almost all the popular authors of the day have contributed one or more
               scintillations of their genius; and it is with feelings of pride, admiration, and
               gratitude, that the Editor and Proprietors offer their warmest acknowledgements to

                  [<emph>sic</emph>]; and to the other contributors.</p>
            <p>In expressing the Editor's thanks in a separate paragraph to S. T. Coleridge, Esq.'
               It must not be supposed that his obligations are the less  important to those whose
               names have just been mentioned; but where a favor has been conferred in a peculiar
               manner, it at least demands that it should be peculiarly acknowledged.  Mr.
               Coleridge, in the most liberal manner, permitted the Editor to select what he pleased
               from all his unpublished MSS., and it will be seen from the “Wanderings of Cain,”
               though unfinished, and the other pieces bearing that Gentleman's name, that whenever
               he may favour the world with a perfect collection of his writings he will adduce new
               and powerful claims upon its respect.</p>
            <p>In another, but no less important department of talent, the Proprietors have yet to
               pay their debt of gratitude.  From the invaluable favours he has conferred upon the
               work, the first among those claimants is he, who is the first in professional
               reputation, in liberality, and in all which characterises a Gentle-<pb n="viii"
                  xml:id="image017"/>man, Sir Thomas Lawrence, the President of the Royal Academy,
               who has bestowed on it three of his unrivalled productions; and which, it is needless
               to say, are of themselves sufficient to place "THE BIJOU" in the foremost rank of the
               embellished publications of Europe.</p>
            <p>To H. W. Pickersgill, Esq. R. A. the Proprietors are deeply indebted for the
               gratuitous use of his beautiful picture “The Oriental Love-Letter,” in the Council
               Room of the Royal Academy; and which derives considerable interest from the elegant
               illustration by which it is accompanied from the pen of his accomplished wife.  To
               Mr. W. H. Worthington the Proprietors are grateful for the loan of his painting "The
               Suitors Rejected."</p>
            <p>In consequence of a resemblance between the principal incident in the Tale of
               HALLORAN THE PEDLAR and the catastrophe described in a recent publication of deserved
               popularity, both evidently referring to the same historical fact, it is necessary, in
               order to prevent the suspicion of plagiarism, to state that the Tale of Halloran was
               written, and in the hands of the publisher, long previously to the appearance of the
               Novel where a similar circumstance is related.  Many most valuable papers, nearly
               sufficient to form another volume, remain in the Editor's possession; for the obvious
               reason of superabundance of matter, it was impossible to insert them in the present
               work.</p>
            <pb n="ix" xml:id="image018"/>
            <p>Amidst other literary curiosities, two will be found which derive their chief
               attraction from the illustrious rank and eminent virtues of their authors:  these
               are, a translation of the celebrated Epistle of Servius Sulpicius to M. T. Cicero, by
               his present Majesty; and of Cicero's Epistle to Servius Sulpicius, by the lamented
               Duke of York, both written as exercises at a very early age.</p>
            <p>The selection of Graphic Illustrations was made by Mr. Robert Balmanno, Secretary of
               the Artists' Fund, and the Publisher.</p>
            <p>Whether THE BIJOU be worthy of its name, and how far the proprietors have redeemed
               the claim pledged in their prospectus, must be left to the public to determine.  It
               has been their unceasing endeavour to concentrate specimens of the varied talent,
               both in literature and art, for which this country is renowned; to allow the powers
               of the pencil, and the connotations of the mind, mutually to relieve and and adorn
               each other, where</p>
            <lg>
               <l rend="indent5">"Each lends to each a double charm,</l>
               <l rend="indent5">Like pearls upon an Ethiop's arm;"</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And as no trouble has been considered too laborious, no expense too great to
               accomplish this object, they submit the result of their exertions with confidence
               unalloyed by presumption, but not unmixed with hope.</p>

            <p>"A LITTLE further, O my father, yet a little farther, and we shall come into the open
               moonlight!" Their road was through a forest of fir- trees; at its entrance the trees
               stood at distances from each other, and the path was broad, and the moonlight, and
               the moonlight shadows reposed upon it, and appeared quietly to inhabit that solitude.
               But soon the path winded and became narrow; the sun at high noon sometimes speckled,
               but never illumined it, and now it was dark as a cavern.</p>
            <p>"It is dark, O my father!" said Enos, "but the path under our feet is mooth and soft,
               and we shall soon come out into the open moonlight. Ah, why dost thou groan so
               deeply?"</p>
            <p>"Lead on my child," said Cain, "guide me, little child." And the innocent little
               child clasped a finger of the hand which had murdered the righteous Abel, and he
               guided his father. "The fir branches drip upon thee my son." — "Yea, pleasantly,
               father, for I ran fast and eagerly to bring thee the pitcher and the <pb n="18"
                  xml:id="image041"/>cake, and my body is not yet cool. How happy the squirrels are
               that feed on these fir trees! they leap from bough to bough, and the old squirrels
               play round their young ones in the nest. I clomb a tree yesterday at noon, O my
               father, that I might play with them, but they leapt away from the branches, even to
               the slender twigs did they leap, and in amoment I beheld them on antoher tree. Why, O
               my fahter, would they not play with me? Is it because we are not so happy as they? Is
               it because I groan sometimes even as thou groanest?" Then Cain stopped and stifling
               his groans, he sank to the earth, and the child Enos stood in the darkness beside
               him; and Cain lifted up his voice, and cried bitterly, and said, "The Mighty One that
               persecuteth me is on this side and on that; he pursueth my soul like the wind, like
               the sand- blast he passeth through me; he is around me even as the air, O that I
               might be utterly no more! I desire to die — yea, the things that never had life,
               neither move they upon the earth — behold they seem precious to mine eyes. O that a
               man might live without the breath of his nostrils, so I might abide in darkness and
               blackness, and an empty space! Yea, I would lie down, I would not rise, neither would
               I stir my limbs till I became as the rock in the den of the lion, on which the young
               lion resteth his head whilst he sleepeth. For the torrent that roareth far off hath a
               voice; and the clouds in heaven look terribly on me; the mighty one who is against me
               speaketh in <pb n="19" xml:id="image042"/>the wind of the cedar grove; and in silence
               I am dried up." Then Enos spake to his father, "Arise my father, arise, we are but a
               little way from the place where I found the cake and the pitcher;" and Cain said,
               "How knowest thou?" and the child answered — "Behold, the bare rocks are a few of
               they strides distant from the forest; and while even now thou wert lifting up thy
               voice, I heard the echo." Then the child took hold of his father, as if he would
               raise him, and Cain being faint and feeble rose slowly on his knees and pressed
               himself against the trunk of a fir, and stood upright and followed the child. The
               path was dark till within three strides' length of its termination when it turned
               suddenly; the thick black trees formed a low arch, and the moonlight appeared for a
               moment like a dazzling portal. Enos ran before and stood in the open air; and when
               Cain, his father, emerged from the darkness the child was affrighted, for the mighty
               limbs of Cain were wasted as by fire; his hair was black, and matted into loathly
               curls, and his countenance was dark and wild, and told in a strange and terrible
               language of agonies that had been, and were, and were still to continue to be.</p>
            <p>The scene around was desolate; as far as the eye could reach, it was desolate; the
               bare rocks faced each other, and left a long and wide interval of their white sand.
               You might wander on and look round and round, and peep into the crevices of the
               rocks, and discover nothing that acknowledged the in- <pb n="20" xml:id="image043"
               />fluence of the seasons. There was no spring, no summer, no autumn, and the winter's
               snow that would have been lovely, fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands.
               Never morning lark had poised himself over this desert; but the huge serpent often
               hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture, and the vulture screamed, his wings
               imprisoned within the coilds of the serpent. The pointed and shattered summits of the
               ridges of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns, and seemed to prophecy
               mutely of things that then were not; steeples, and battlements, and ships with naked
               masts. As far from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook, there was one
               rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge. It had been precipitated
               there perhaps by the terrible groan the earth gave when our first father fell. Before
               you approached, it appeared to lie flat on the ground, but its base slanted from its
               point, and between its points and the sands a tall man might stand upright. It was
               here that Enos had found the pitcher and cake, and to this place he led his father.
               But ere they arrived there they beheld a human shape; his back was towards them, and
               they were coming up unperceived when they heard him smite his breast and cry aloud,
               "Wo, is me! wo, is me! I must never die again, and yet I am perishing with thirst and
               hunger."</p>
            <p>The face of Cain turned pale; but Enos said, "Ere yet I could speak, I am sure, O my
               father, that <pb n="21" xml:id="image044"/>I heard that voice. Have not I often said
               that I remembered a sweet voice. O my father! this is it;" and Cain trembled
               exceedingly. The voice was sweet indeed, but it was thin and querulous like that of a
               feeble slave in misery, who despairs altogether, yet can not refrain himself from
               weeping and lamentation. Enos crept softly round the base of the rock, and stood
               before the stranger, and looked up into his face. And the Shape shrieked, and turned
               round, and Cain beheld him, that his limbs and his face were those of his brother
               Abel whom he had killed; and Cain stood like one who struggles in his sleep because
               of the exceeding terribleness of a dream; and ere he had recovered himself from the
               tumult of his agitation, the Shape fell at this feet, and embraced his knees, and
               cried out with a bitter outcry, "Thou eldest born of Adam, whom Eve, my mother,
               brought forth, cease to torment me! I was feeding my flocks in green pastures by the
               side of quiet rivers, and thou killedst me; and now I am in misery." Then Cain closed
               his eyes, and hid them with his hands — and again he opened his eyes, and looked
               around him, and said to Enos "What beholdest thou? Didst thou hear a voice, my son?"
               "Yes, my father, I beheld a man in unclean garments, and he uttered a sweet voice,
               full of lamentation." Then Cain raised up the shape that was like Abel, and said,
               "The creator of our father, who had <pb n="22" xml:id="image045"/>respect unto thee,
               and unto thy offering, wherefore hath he forsaken thee?" Then the Shape shrieked a
               second time, and rent his garment, and his naked skin was like the white sands
               beneath their feet; and he shrieked yet a third time, and threw himself on his face
               upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the rock, and Cain and Enos sate
               beside him; the child by his right hand, and Cain by his left. They were all three
               under the rock, and within the shadow. The Shape that was like Abel raised himself
               up, and spake to the child; "I know where the cold , waters are, but I may not drink,
               wherefore didst thou then take away my pitcher?" but Cain said, "Didst thou not find
               favour in the sight of the Lord thy god?" The Shape answered, "The Lord is God of the
               living only, the dead have another god." Then the child Enos lifted up his eyes and
               prayed; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart. "Wretched shall they be all the days
               of their mortal life," exclaimed the Shape, "who sacrifice worthy and acceptable
               sacrifices to the God of the dead; but after death their toil ceaseth. Woe is me, for
               I was well beloved by the God of the living, and cruel wert thou, O my brother, who
               didst snatch me away from his power and his dominion." Having uttered these words, he
               rose suddenly, and fled over the sands, and Cain said in his heart, "The curse of the
               lords is on me — but who is the God of the dead?" and he ran after the shape, and the
               Shape fled <pb n="23" xml:id="image046"/>shrieking over the sands, and the sands rose
               like white mists behind the steps of Cain, but the feet of him that was not like Abel
               disturbed not the sands. He greatly outrun Cain, and turning short, he wheeled round,
               and came again to the rock where they had been sitting, and where Enos still stood;
               and the child caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and that theman had fallen
               upon the ground; and Cain stopped, and beholding him not, said, "he has passed into
               the dark woods," and walked slowly back to the rocks, and when he reached it the
               child told him that he had caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and that the
               man had fallen upon the ground; and Cain once more sat beside him, and said — "Abel,
               my brother, I would lament for thee, but that the spirit within me is withered, and
               burnt up with extreme agony. Now, I pray thee, by thy flocks and by thy pastures, and
               by the quiet rivers which thou lovest, that thou tell me all that thou knowest. Who
               is the God of the dead? where doth he make his dwelling? what sacrifices are
               acceptable unto him? for I have offered, but have not been received; I have prayed,
               and have not been heard; and how can I be afflicted more than I already am?" The
               Shape arose and answered — "O that thou hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on
               thee. Follow me, son of Adam! and bring thy child with thee:" and they three passed
               over the white sands between the rocks, silent as their shadows.</p>

            <p>LETTER FROM SIR WALTER SCOTT TO SIR ADAM FERGUSON, DESCRIPTIVE OF A PICTURE PAINTED
               AT ABBOTSFORD BY DAVID WILKIE, ESQ. R. A., AND EXHIBITED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY IN
               1818.</p>
            <p>MY DEAR ADAM — The picture you mention has something in it of rather a domestic
               character, as the personages are represented in a sort of masquerade, such being the
               pleasure of the accomplished painter. Nevertheless, if you, the proprietor, incline
               to have it engraved, I do not see that I am entitled to make any objection.</p>
            <p>But Mr. * * * mentions besides, a desire to have anecdotes of my private and domestic
               life, or, as he expresses himslef, a portrait of the author in his nightgown and
               slippers; — and this form you, who, I dare say, could furnish some anecdotes of our
               younger days which might now seem ludicrous enough. Even as to my night gown and
               slippers, I believe the time has been when the articles of my wardrobe were as
               familiar to your memory as Poins's <pb n="34" xml:id="image059"/>to Prince Henry, but
               that period has been for some years past, and I cannot think it would be interesting
               to the public to learn that I had changed my old robe-de-chambre for a handsome
               douillette, when I was last at Paris.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that a man of ordinary sense cannot be supposed delighted with the
               species of gossip which, in the dearth of other news, recurs to such a quiet
               individual as myself; and though, like a well-behaved lion of twenty years standing,
               I am not inclined to vex myself about what I cannot help, I will not, in any case in
               which I can prevent it, be acessary to these follies. There is no man known at all in
               literature who may not have more to tell of his private life than I have: I have
               surmounted no difficulties either of birth or education, nor have I been favored by
               any particular advantages, and my life has been as void of incidents of importance,
               as that of the "weary knife-grinder."</p>
            <p>"Story! God bless you! I have none to tell, Sir."</p>
            <p>The follies of youth ought long since to have passed away; and if the prejudices and
               absurdities of age have come in their place, I will keep them, as Beau Tibbs did his
               prospect, for the amusement of my domestic friends. A mere enumeration of the persons
               in the sketch is all which I can possible permit to be published respecting myself
               and my <pb n="35" xml:id="image060"/>family; and, as must be the lot of humanity when
               we look back seven or eight years, even what follows cannot be drawn up without some
               very painful recollections.</p>
            <p>The idea which our inimitable Wilkie adopted ws to represent our family group in the
               garb of south-country peasants, supposed to be concerting a merry-making, for which
               some of the preparations are seen. The place is the terrace near Kayside, commanding
               an extensive view toward the Eildon-hills. 1. The sitting figure, in the dress of a
               miller, I believe, represents Sir Walter Scott, author of a few scores of volumes,
               and proprietor of Abbotsford, in the County of Roxburgh. 2. In front, and presenting,
               we may suppose, a country wag somewhat addicted to poaching, stands sir Adam
               Ferguson, Knight, Keeper of the Regalia of Scotland. 3. In the background is a very
               handsome old man, upwards of eighty-four years old at the time, painted in his own
               character of a shepherd. He also belonged to numerous clan of Scott. He used to claim
               credit for three things unusual among the southland shepherds: first, that he had
               never been fou in the course of his life; secondly, that he never had struck a man in
               anger; thirdly, that though entrusted with the the management of large sales of
               stock, he had never lost a penny for his master by a bad debt. He died soon aterwards
               at Abbotsford. 4, 5, 6. Of the three female figures <pb n="36" xml:id="image061"/>the
               elder is the late regretted mother of the family represented. 5. The young person
               most forward in the group is Miss Sophia Charlotte Scott, now Mrs. John Gibson
               Lockhart; and 6, her younger sister, Miss ann Scott. Both are represented as
               ewe-milkers, with their leglins, or milk-pails. 7. On the left hand of the shepherd,
               the young man holding a fowling-piece is the eldest son of Sir Walter, now Captain in
               King's Hussars. 8. The boy is the youngest of the family, Charles Scott, now of
               Brazen Nose College, Oxford. The two dogs were distinguished favorites of the family;
               the large one was a stag-hound of the old Highland breed, called Maida, and one of
               the hansomest dogs that could be found; it was a present to me from the chief of
               Glengary, and was highly valued, both on account of his beauty, his fidelity, and the
               great rarity of the breed. The other is little Highland terrier, called
                  <emph>Ourisk</emph> (goblin), of a particualr kind, bred in Kintail. It was a
               present from the honorable Mrs. Stuart Mackenzie, and is a valuable specimen of race
               which is now also scarce. Maida, like Bran, Lerath, and other dogs of distinction,
               slumbers "beneath his stone," distinguished by an epitaph, which to the honour of
               Scottish scholarship be it spoken, has only one false quantity in two lines.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Maidae marmorea dormis sub imagine Maida</l>
               <l>Ad januam domini sit tibi terra levis.</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="37" xml:id="image062"/>
            <p>Ourisk still survives, but like some other personages in the picture, with talents
               and temper rather the worse for wear. She has become what Dr. Rutty, the Quaker,
               records himself in his journal as having sometimes been — sinfully dogged and
               snappish.</p>
            <p>If it should suit Mr. * * *'s purpose to adopt the above illustrations, he is
               heartily welcome to them, but I make it my especial bargain that nothing more is said
               upon such a meagre subject.</p>
            <p>It strikes me, however, that there is a story about old Thomas Scott, the shepherd,
               which is characteristic, and which I will make your friend welcome to. Tom was, both
               as a trusted servant, and as a rich fellow in his line, a person of considerable
               importance among his class in the neighbourhood, and used to stickle a good deal to
               keep his place in public opinion. Now, he suffered, in his own idea at least, from
               the consequence assumed by a country neighbour, who, though neither so well reputed
               for wealth or sagacity as Thomas Scott, had yet an advantage over him, from having
               seen the late King, and used to take precedence upon all occasions when they chanced
               to meet. Thomas suffered under this superiority. But after this sketch was finished,
               and exhibited in London, the newspapers made it known that his present majesty had
               condescended to take some notice of it. Delighted with the circumstance, Thomas Scott
               set out on a most oppressively hot day, to walk five miles to Bowden, <pb n="38"
                  xml:id="image063"/>where his rival resided. He had no sooner entered the cottage
               when he called out in his broad forest dialect — "Andro', man, did ye anes sey (see)
               the King?" "In troth did I, Tam," answered Andro'; "sit down, and I'll tell ye a'
               about it: — ye sey I was at Lonon, in a place they ca' the park, that is, no like a
               hained hog-fence, or like the four-nooked parks in this country — " "Hout awa," said
               Thomas, "I have heard a' that before: I only came ower the know now to tell you,
               that, if you have seen the king, the king has seen mey" (me). And so he returned with
               a jocund heart, assuring his friends "it had done him muckle gude to settle accounts
               with Andro'."</p>
            <p>Jocere haec — as the old Laird of Restalrig writes to the Earl of Gowrie — farewell
               my old, tried, and dear friend of forty long years. Our enjoyments must now be of a
               character less vivid than those we have shared together,</p>
            <p>But still at our lot it were vain to repine, Youth cannot return, or the days of Lang
               Syne.</p>

               <p>[The battle of Montiel was that which determined the fate of Pedro the Cruel. Just
                  ten years before it took place he and Edward the Black Prince had utterly defeated
                  at Nejara Henry (called of Transtamara) Pedro's natural brother, the competitor
                  for the throne of Castile: But in the interval Pedro's cruelties had alienated the
                  affection of his subjects, and the murder of his wife Blanche of Bourbon, sister
                  to the King of France, had stirred up an enemy whom, being deserted by the English
                  Prince, he had no longer any sufficient means to resist.</p>
               <p>Pedro's famous mistress, Maria de Padilla, was in the castle of Montiel when the
                  battle was fought, and after her lover was slain received the body and was
                  permitted to bury it.</p>
               <p>The French army was commanded by the illustrous Bertrand du Guesclin — in whose
                  memoirs the highly picturesque details of the conflict, the subsequent meeting of
                  the brothers, and the death of Pedro, may be found. Le Begue was the French knight
                  who stabbed Pedro.]</p>

            </head>
            <p>ABOUT the centre of a deep winding and woody lane, in the secluded village of
               Aberleigh, stands an old farm-house, whose stables, out-buildings, and ample yard,
               have a peculiarly forlorn and deserted appearance; they can, in fact, scarcely be
               said to be occupied, the person who rents the land preferring to live at a large farm
               about a mile distant, leaving this lonely house to the care of a labourer and his
               wife, who reside in one end, and have the charge of a few colts and heifers that run
               in the orchard and an adjoining meadow, whilst the vacant rooms are tenanted by a
               widow in humble circumstances and her young family.</p>
            <p>The house is beautifully situated; deep, as I have said, in a narrow woody lane,
               which winds between high banks, now feathered with hazel, now thickly studded with
               pollards and forest trees, until opposite Kibe's farm it widens sufficiently to admit
               a large clear pond, round which the hedge, closely and regularly set with a row of
               tall elms, sweeps in a graceful curve, forming for that bright mirror, a rich leafy
                  <pb n="66" xml:id="image091"/>frame. A little way farther on the lane again
               widens, and makes an abrupter winding, as it is crossed by a broad shallow stream, a
               branch of the Loddon, which comes meandering along from a chain of beautiful meadows;
               then turns in a narrower channel by the side of the road, and finally spreads itself
               into a large piece of water, almost a lakelet, amidst the rushes and the willows of
               Hartley Moor. A foot-bridge is flung over the stream, where it crosses the lane,
               which, with a giant oak growing on the bank, and throwing its broad branches far on
               the opposite side, forms in every season a pretty rural picture.</p>
            <p>Kibe's farm is as picturesque as its situation; very old, very irregular, with gable
               ends, clustered chimneys, casement windows, a large porch, and a sort of square wing
               jutting out even with the porch, and covered with a luxuriant vine, which has quite
               the effect, especially when seen by moonlight, of an ivy-mantled tower. One side
               extends the ample but disused farm buildings; on the other the old orchard, whose
               trees are so wild, so hoary and so huge, as to convey the idea of a fruit forest.
               Behind the house is an ample kitchen-garden, and before a neat flower court, the
               exclusive demesne of Mrs. Lucas and family, to whom indeed the labourer, John Miles,
               and his good wife Dinah, served in some sort as domestics.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Lucas had known far better days. Her <pb n="67" xml:id="image092"/>husband had
               been an officer, and died fighting bravely in one of the last battles of the
               Peninsular war, leaving her with three children, one lovely boy and two delicate
               girls, to struggle through the world as best she might. She was an accomplished
               woman, and at first, settled in great town, and endeavoured to improve her small
               income by teaching music and languages. But she was country bred; her children too
               had been born in the country, amidst the sweetest recesses of the New Forest, and
               pining herself for liberty, and solitude, and green fields, and fresh air, she soon
               began to fancy that her children were visibly deteriorating in health and appearance
               and pining for them also; and finding that her old servant Dinah Miles was settled
               with her husband in this deserted farm-house, she applied to his master to rent for a
               few months the untenanted apartments, came to Aberleigh, and fixed there apparently
               for life.</p>
            <p>We lived in different parishes, and she declined company, so that I seldom met Mrs.
               Lucas, and had lost sight of her for some years, retaining merely a general
               recollection of the mild, placid, elegant mother, surrounded by three rosy, romping
               bright-eyed children, when the arrival of an intimate friend at Aberleigh rectory
               caused me frequently to pass the lonely farm-house, and threw this interesting family
               again under my observation.</p>
            <p>The first time that I saw them was on a bright <pb n="68" xml:id="image093"/>summer
               evening, when the nightingale was yet in the coppice, the briar rose blossoming in
               the hedge, and the sweet scent of the bean fields perfuming the air. Mrs. Lucas,
               still lovely and elegant, though somewhat faded and careworn, was walking pensively
               up and down the grass path of the pretty flower court; her eldest daughter, a rosy
               bright brunette, with her dark hair floating in all directions, was darting about
               like bird; now tying up the pinks, now watering the geraniums, now collecting the
               fallen rose leaves into the straw bonnet which dangled from her arm; and now feeding
               a brood of bantams from a little barley measure, which that sagacious and active
               colony seemed to recognise as if by instinct, coming long before she called them at
               their swiftest pace, between a run and a fly, to await with their usual noisy and
               bustling patience the showers of grain which she flung to them across the paling. It
               was a beautiful picture of youth, and health, and happiness; and her clear gay voice,
               and brilliant smile, accorded well with a shape and motion as light as a butterfly,
               and as wild as the wind. A beautiful picture was that rosy lass of fifteen in her
               unconscious loveliness, and I might have continued gazing on her longer, had I not
               been attracted by an object no less charming, although in a very different way.</p>
            <p>It was a slight elegant girl, apparently about a year younger than the pretty romp of
               the flower <pb n="69" xml:id="image094"/>garden, not unlike her in form and feature,
               but totally distinct in colouring and expression.</p>
            <p>She sate in the old porch, wreathed with jessamine and honeysuckle, with the western
               sun floating around her like a glory, and displaying the singular beauty of her
               chesnut hair, brown with a golden light, and the exceeding delicacy of ther smooth
               and finely grained complexion, so pale, and yet so healthful. Her whole face and form
               had a bending and statue-like grace, encreased by the adjustment of her splendid
               hair, which was parted on her white forehead, and gathered up behind in a large knot
               — a natural coronet. Her eyebrows and long eyelashes were a few shades darker than
               her hair, and singularly rich and beautiful. She was plaiting straw rapidly and
               skilfully, and bent over her work with a mild and placid attention, a sedate
               pensiveness that did not belong to her age, and which contrasted strangely and sadly
               with the gaiety of her laughing and brilliant sister, who at this moment darted up to
               her with a handful of pinks and some groundsel. Jessy received them with a smile —
               such a smile! — spoke a few sweet words in a sweet sighing voice; put the flowers in
               her bosom, and the groundsel in the cage of a linnet that hung near her; and then
               resumed her seat and her work, imitating better than I have ever heard them imitated,
               the various notes of a <pb n="70" xml:id="image095"/>nightingale who was singing in
               the opposite hedge; whilst I, ashamed of loitering longer, passed on.</p>
            <p>The next time I saw her, my interest in this lovely creature was increased tenfold —
               for I then knew that Jessy was blind — a misfortune always so touching, especially in
               early youth, and in her case rendered peculiarly affecting by the personal character
               of the individual. We soon became acquainted, and even intimate under the benign
               auspices of the kind mistress of the rectory; and every interview served to encrease
               the interest excited by the whole family, and most of all by the sweet blind
               girl.</p>
            <p>Never was any human being more gentle generous, and grateful, or more unfeignedly
               resigned to her great calamity. The pensiveness that marked her character arose as I
               soon perceived from a different source. Her blindness had been of recent occurrence,
               arising from inflammation unskilfully treated, and was pronounced incurable; but from
               coming on so lately, it admitted of several alleviations, of which she was accustomed
               to speak with a devout and tender gratitude. "She could work," she said, "as well as
               ever; and cut out, and write, and dress herself, and keep the keys, and run errands
               in the house she knew so well without making any mistake or confusion. Reading, to be
               sure, she had been forced to give up, and drawing: <pb n="71" xml:id="image096"/>and
               some day or other she would shew me, only that it seemed so vain, some verses which
               her dear brother William had written upon a groupe of wild flowers, which she had
               begun before her misfortune. Oh, it was almost worth while to be blind to be the
               subject of such verse, and the object of such affection! Her dear mamma was very good
               to her, and so was Emma; but William — oh she wished that I knew William! No one
               could be so kind as he! It was impossible! He read to her; he talked to her; he
               walked with her; he taught her to feel confidence in walking alone; he had made for
               her use the wooden steps up the high bank which led into Kibe's meadow; he had put
               the hand-rail on the old bridge, so that now she could get across without danger,
               even when the brook was flooded. He had tamed her linnet; he had constructed the
               wooden frame, by the aid of which she could write so comfortable and evenly; could
               write letters to him, and say her own self all that she felt of love and gratitude.
               And that," she continued with a deep sigh, "was her chief comfort now; for William
               was gone, and they should never meet again — never alive — that she was sure of — she
               knew it." "But why, Jessy?" "Oh, because William was so much too good for this world:
               there was nobody like William! And he was gone for a soldier. Old General Lucas, her
               father's uncle, had sent for him abroad; <pb n="72" xml:id="image097"/>had given him
               a commission in his regiment; and he would never come home — at least they should
               never meet again — of that she was sure — she knew it."</p>
            <p>This persuasion was evidently the master-grief of poor Jessy's life, the cause that
               far more than her blindness faded her cheek, and saddened her spirit. How it had
               arisen no one knew; partly, perhaps, from some lurking superstition, some idle word,
               or idler omen which had taken root in her mind, nourished by the calamity which in
               other respects she bore so calmly, but which left her so often in darkness and
               loneliness to brood over her own gloomy forebodings; partly from her trembling
               sensibility, and partly from the delicacy of frame and of habit which had always
               characterised the object of her love — a slender youth, whose ardent spirit was but
               too apt to overtask his body.</p>
            <p>However it found admittance, there the presentiment was, hanging like a dark cloud
               over the sunshine of Jessy's young life. Reasoning was useless. They know little of
               the passions who seek to argue with that most intractable of them all, the fear that
               is born of love; so Mrs. Lucas and Emma tried to amuse away those sad thoughts,
               trusting to time, to William's letters, and above all, to William's return to
               eradicate the evil.</p>
            <p>The letters came punctually and gaily; letters <pb n="73" xml:id="image098"/>that
               might have quieted the heart of any sister in England, except the fluttering heart of
               Jessy Lucas. William spoke of improved health, of increased strength, of actual
               promotion, and expected recal. At last he even announced his return under auspices
               the most gratifying to his mother, and the most beneficial to her family. The
               regiment was ordered home, and the old and wealthy relation, under whose protection
               he had already risen so rapidly, had expressed his intention to accompany him to
               Kibe's farm, to be introduced to his nephew's widow and daughters, especially Jessy,
               for whom he expressed himself greatly interested. A letter from General Lucas
               himself, which arrived by the same post, was still more explicit: it adduced the
               son's admirable character and exemplary conduct as reasons for befriending the
               mother, and avowed his design of providing for each of his young relatives, and of
               making William his heir.</p>
            <p>For half an hour after the first hearing of these letters, Jessy was happy — till the
               peril of a Winter voyage (for it was deep January) crossed her imagination, and
               checked her joy. At length, long before they were expected, another epistle arrived,
               dated Portsmouth. They had sailed by the next vessel to that which conveyed their
               previous dispatches, and might be expected hourly at Kibe's farm. The voyage was
               past, safely past, and the weight seemed <pb n="74" xml:id="image099"/>now really
               taken from Jessy's heart. She raised her sweet face and smiled; yet still it was a
               fearful and a trembling joy, and somewhat of fear was mingled even with the very
               intensity of her hope. It had been a time of rain and wind; and the Loddon, the
               beautiful Loddon, always so affluent of water, had overflowed its boundaries, and
               swelled the smaller streams which it fed into torrents. The brook which crossed
               Kibe's lane had washed away part of the foot-bridge, destroying poor William's
               railing, and was still foaming and dashing like a cataract. Now that was the nearest
               way; and if William should insist on coming that way! To be sure, the carriage road
               was round by Grazely Green, but to cross the brook would save half a mile; and
               William, dear William, would never think of danger to get to those whom he loved.
               These were Jessy's thoughts: the fear seemed impossible, for no postillion would
               think of breasting that roaring stream; but the fond sister's heart was fluttering
               like a new caught bird, and she feared she knew not what.</p>
            <p>All day she paced the little court, and stopped and listened, and listened and
               stopped. About sunset, with the nice sense of sound which seemed to come with her
               fearful calamity, and that fine sense, quickened by anxiety, expectation, and love,
               she heard, she thought she heard, she was sure she heard the sound of a carriage
               rapidly advancing on the <pb n="75" xml:id="image100"/>other side of the stream. "It
               is only the noise of the rushing waters," cried Emma. "I hear a carriage, the horses,
               the wheels!" replied Jessy; and darted off at once, with the double purpose of
               meeting William, and of warning the postillion of crossing the stream. Emma and her
               mother followed, fast! fast! But what speed could vie with Jessy's, when the object
               was William? They called, but she neither heard nor answered. Before they had to won
               to the bend in the lane she had reached the brook; and, long before either of her
               pursuers had gained the bridge, her foot had slipt from the wet and tottering plank,
               and she was borne resistlessly down the stream. Assistance was immediately procured;
               men, and ropes, and boats; for the sweet blind girl was beloved of all, and many a
               poor man perilled his life in a fruitless endeavor to save Jessy Lucas; and William,
               too, was there, for Jessy's quickened sense had not deceived her. William was there,
               struggling with all the strength of love and agony to rescue that dear and helpless
               creature; but every effort — although he persevered until he too was taken out
               senseless — every effort was vain. The fair corse was recovered, but life was
               extinct. Poor Jessy's prediction was verified to the letter; and the brother and his
               favourite sister never met again.</p>

            <p>"UPON what knave's errand art thou sent, my dainty page thus early?" exclaimed
               Leonora, "had I not been afoot with the lark to gather May- dew before the sun had
               drank the moisture from these flowers, thou mightest have gone bootless home again,
               for my lady the countess, and Victorine and Eugenie still press their pillows:
               dreaming perchance of thy master and his gallant esquire; dost think boy, that
               sallow-visaged melancholy baron, sighing after the wreck of the fortune which he
               lacks the wit to mend, or the doughty hero, Roland, who would fain prompt him, if his
               dull brain could compass the matter, to some dexterous shift or stirring enterprise;
               or those goodly trencher men, Dugarde and Montresor, are like to haunt a lady's
               slumbers?"</p>
            <p>"Faith, Leonora," replied the page, "it passes my poor judgment to decide what it may
               please the fancy of thy lady and her maids to dream about; the place is solitary thou
               knowest — there are no other cavaliers of any mark or likelihood within a dozen <pb
                  n="100" xml:id="image135"/>miles, they wear feathers in their caps and deck their
               legs in silken hose, things which women wondrously affect to look upon, and perchance
               in default of more ruffling gallants, they may be endured."</p>
            <p>"Now out upon thee, for a saucy varlet," cried Leonora, "hie thee hence, sire page,
               or thou shalt taste the discipline of the scullion's broom, and be sent roaring home
               again."</p>
            <p>"An' thou dost not bid me stay, fair mistress, I'll get me gone, and speedily, but
               I'll carry that away which to possess thou wouldst give — aye, the lovelock Roland
               begged so earnestly last night, which thou sworest should go with thee to thy grave —
               a secret, Leonora."</p>
            <p>"A secret — nay, purse not up thy pretty mouth, thou paragon of pages, but tell it
               quickly; come, thou art a sprightly lad, and wilt make a better knight than thy
               master."</p>
            <p>"And dost thou think to beguile me with sugared words; no, no, something better,
               lady, or I'm gone."</p>
            <p>"Thou shalt have an eyas, one that the master falconer engages shall prove a tarsel
               gentle; I'll broider thee thy glove myself, and its jesses shall be of silver:
               methinks thou only wantest a bird upon thy fist to brave it with the best."</p>
            <p>"Wilt thou give me a kiss, Madonna?"</p>
            <p>"Aye, manikin, twenty; dost think that I should blush to press the smooth lip of such
               a beard-<pb n="101" xml:id="image136"/>less urchin? go to, I'll give thee something
               better than a kiss, take this fair chain of gold, a metal wondrous scant at yonder
               castle, if report speak true; every link will buy thee some rich gawd; thou shalt
               have horse to ride, a good sword girded at thy side, and still wear half its length
               about thy neck."</p>
            <p>"Methinks I could carry a hawk as fair, and manage a steed, and wield a rapier as
               well as the favourite page of King Charles himself, but though I prize a horse and a
               falcon, and thy massy chain, and thy sweet kisses, pretty Leonora, I'll not sell my
               secret for aught a-kin to lucre; thou shalt have it without fee or guerdon, because I
               desire to merit the gilded spurs I mean to win, and I deem it to be rank cowardice
               for men to set their wit against the weaker sex."</p>
            <p>"Aye, marry, these are dainty scruples, malapert conceited minion, keep thy council
               to aid thy master and his sapient friends, and leave us to countervail their plots.
               This must needs be some device of Roland's, for the baron has thought of nothing
               better than to sigh under the garden wall, while his trusty squire clears his hoarse
               throat and trolls some dismal ditty; and Dugarde and Montresor being kept fasting,
               groan in concert, and cast tender glances at Victorine and Eugenie, or at the shields
               of brawn which the servitors carry into the buttery, it were hard to say which."</p>
            <pb n="102" xml:id="image137"/>
            <p>"Farewell, mistress Leonora, I meant to do thy lady a service; for not to speak it
               disparagingly, her broad lands rather than her beauty have tempted my master, whose
               revenues are, as thou sayest, somewhat slack, to play false to his plighted bride;
               and thy glittering carkanets, Leonora, and the pearl studs, and the diamond bodkins
               in which the silly hearts of thy fair companions so much delight, are the grand
               attraction with his needy followers. I dare not hint that Roland is drawn hither by
               any brighter object than thine eyes, but Montresor and Dugarde see butts of
               malvoisin, haunches of the red deer, hawks, Damascus blades, and Barbary coursers in
               every gem."</p>
            <p>"I guessed as much," exclaimed Leonora, "an' thy secret be upon a par with thy news,
               'twere scarcely worth while to rise so early with it, but for once, though thou
               deserv'st it not, I'll humour thee; I see thou art burning to tell this marvellous
               tale, so out with it — from sheer compassion I'll lend thee mine ear."</p>
            <p>"Take me then to thy bower, Leonora," replied the page, "for we have idled the time
               until the morning solitude is broken, and stragglers haunt the glade."</p>
            <p>"Willingly, my fair boy, and I'll break thy fast with a manchet of wheaten bread, and
               a platter of potted lampreys, cates I trow not common in the <pb n="103"
                  xml:id="image138"/>baron's hall, and thou shalt wash down both with a cup of
               sack."</p>
            <p>The page and the lady passed into the fair chateau of the young Countess de
               Normanville, laughing as they threw the dew-besprinkled flowers in sport at each
               other, but the frolic mood of the maiden was changed, as after the lapse of an hour
               she shewed the boy out of a little postern gate, and charged him to be faithful.
               Flying round to the mew, where, as he was wont, Bertram de Lille was stationed
               overlooking the falconers and whistling to the hawks, Leonora seized the youth by the
               arm, exclaiming, "To horse! to horse! sweet servant, away to the lady of Beaujeu,
               there is mischief brewing, the thick skulls of the baron's followers have hatched a
               plot which will cost thee some hard riding, and me all the jewels in my casket to
               defeat. Here are twenty broad pieces for the lacquey who keeps the door, and this
               rich chain for the seneschal that you may have speech of the lady; and stay, here is
               a ruby ring as some small token of our mistress's affection for her royal kinswoman,
               and these clasps and brooches are for her waiting gentlewomen, that they may speed
               thy errand; and as I learn that money is not over plenty in the king's camp, for the
               jewels of the Duchess of Savoy and the Marchioness of Montserrat, which he has
               borrowed, lie in pawn for his necessities, stint not to say that so there be a fa-<pb
                  n="104" xml:id="image139"/>vourable answer to this missive, plate to the value of
               a thousand marks shall be dispatched to Lombardy. Now it is well, thou art mounted,
               fly with the speed of the wind, and linger not in making those gambados — thy skill
               in horsemanship has not been cast away on careless eyes."</p>
            <p>De Lille obeyed the commands of the sprightly Leonora with so much zeal and diligence
               that his foaming steed clattered into the court-yard an hour before even her
               impatient spirit expected to see the dust which the charger's hoofs would raise upon
               the adjacent hill; and exchanging his travel-soiled garments for the silken vest
               which displayed his figure to the best advantage, he was ready to join the seneschal
               in his attendance on the ladies in their evening walk through the parks and pleasure
               ground. Passing down a broad flower-bespangled glade they encountered the baron, who
               attired in black garments, and accompanied by his page, and his three trusty
               esquires, advanced to pay his respects to the countess.</p>
            <p>"Fair lady," he exclaimed, "attribute to this ardour of my passion my apparent
               disrespect in approaching you clad in this dolorous habit."</p>
            <p>"What is't, a penance?" interrupted Leonora; "and by the wing of Cupid for some heavy
               offence, for it suits your complexion marvellously ill, and of that the malicious
               priest was aware. A penance it <pb n="105" xml:id="image140"/>must be; the jovial
               countenances of your merry men declare that no evil hap can betided in your
               household."</p>
            <p>"Alas, madam," replied the baron, "I wear this raven-tinted garb as a tribute of
               respect to the memory of one whose death, in sooth, I lament not, since it promises
               to remove one barrier to the suit I have so long and so hopelessly pressed, with the
               lovely but too disdainful mistress of my soul. I am released from my betrothment with
               the Lady Adela, by her decease."</p>
            <p>"What, ho! Master Bertram," exclaimed Leonora, "thou mayest restore the baron to the
               hues of the popinjay, in which he does so much execution in the hearts of simple
               damsels. This gentleman, my lord, is fresh from the court of the lady of Beaujeu,
               where he has seen and conversed with the Lady Adela, who morever has sent thee a
               token that she liveth still to demand the fulfillment of an engagement made before
               her broken fortune caused her to be slighted."</p>
            <p>"And," said the Countess de Normanville, "I marvel that a gentleman and a knight
               should shame his high lineage and chivalric oath by such a paltry device. Know, sir,
               I am also acquainted with the base means with which you have tampered with the
               avarice of my kinsman — an honorable bargain, forsooth — half the estate when you
               lost all hope of <pb n="106" xml:id="image141"/>clutching the whole: but, beware sir,
               neither fraud or force can avail you now; the Lady of Beaujeu, in behalf of my
               sovereign King Charles, has taken my wardship into her own hand, and has alone the
               power to dispose of me in marriage."</p>
            <p>"And my lord," cried Bertram, "there is news from the camp of Charles; he marches
               from triumph to triumph, and he has 'gaged the hands of his wards to the knights, who
               shall add the conquered states of Italy to the crown of France. What sayst thou? my
               poor sword is at the service of my king; I post to the army to-morrow. Wilt thou quit
               thy sylvan warfare in these woods to strive in martial exploits with the gallant
               Lusignan, who it is rumoured wears the Countess de Normanville's glove upon his
               basnet?"</p>
            <p>"Peace, Bertram," cried the seneschal, "the baron loves to court far more dangerous
               perils than the Lombard wars present, to tilt with ladies' eyes instead of
               spears."</p>
            <p>"Tarry for me, Master Bertram," exclaimed the page, "if it be but for the space of a
               single day, and thou shalt not ride alone an there be a broad sword and a steel
               jerkin left in the armoury."</p>
            <p>"Farewell, friend Roland," said Leonora, "thou, too, hast to win thy spurs, and line
               thy purse with bezants; say, wilt thou take thy chance with an uncrested helm to gain
               the land which calls me heir <pb n="107" xml:id="image142"/>in Bertram's absence? He
               leaves me, thou seest, to combat as best I may against thy wit and valour; or wilt
               thou, too, speed to these Lombard wars, and delegate to yon sad browed knight and
               Messieurs Degarde and Montresor, who look wondrous wise, though unhandsomely chary of
               their words, the task of consoling me and my fellow damsels, when these vales shall
               be deprived of the sunshine of thy presence."</p>
            <p>"No, sweet mistress," returned Roland, "though thy sharp tongue and scornful eye
               drive Master Bertram to the tented field, though thy humour were ten times more
               petulant, and thy jests more keen, thou shalt not wear the willow branch for me, or
               hang or drown for lack of one poor servant to bear with thy impertinencies: 'twere
               pity to have them wasted on thy monkey or thy tire woman, send forth thy warrior
               youth to gather laurels, we will pluck them from their brows when they return,</p>
            <p>And thou shalt call him brave who bears away At once, the trophies of each toilsome

                     April, 1827, about the time the great storm of snow was at the height. Next
                     morning many of the snow wreathes on the hills of Ettrick Forest were from
                     twelve to twenty feet deep, and many thousands of lambs, singing birds, and
                     moor game perished. All those of the latter that had begun incubation were
                     literally destroyed. [Author, James Hogg.]</note>

            <p>The Ritter von Reichenstein<note place="foot"
                  resp="Bijou Editor, William Fraser, and/or Author" anchored="true">[Note to "The
                  Ritter Von Reichenstein":] This Austrian story has its foundation in fact. The
                  ruins of Reichenstein Castle are still visible in the district of Muhl, on the
                  river Ens; and in the chapel is the Baron's monument, finely executed by an
                  Italian master. [Fraser and/or Author.]</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE great hall in the royal castle of Linz resounded with kettle-drums and trumpets,
               while King Ferdinand and his Queen sat at the banquet table, rejoicing that the siege
               was now raised, and Austria once more victorious. The banquet was given in honour of
               the young Baron von Reichenstein, who then, for the first time, appeared as the
               King's guest. He had the good fortune to bring the welcome tidings that Solyman,
               after beleaguering the city for many weeks, and being repulsed in every attack, had
               at last suddenly desisted from his undertaking, and retreated by quick marches. Of
               the distinction now conferred on Reichenstein his own noble conduct during the siege
               rendered him eminently worthy, nor could the favour have been bestowed on any one who
               would have valued it more highly, for pride and ambition were indeed his leading
               characteristics.</p>
            <pb n="115" xml:id="image150"/>
            <p>The lively monarch banished for the time all political cares, and gave himself up to
               the festivity of the moment, heightened by the consideration that the good news came
               unexpectedly, as Vienna was then, in truth, but ill provided with the means of
               defence, and the Sultan, at the head of three thousand men, had vowed never to return
               till he had conquered both Hungary and Austria, where the Christian sway should be
               terminated for ever. Merrily coursed the brimming goblets round the table, and in the
               joy of his heart the King proposed the health of his country's brave defender, the
               heroic youth, Philip Palsgraf of the Rhine, and of the veteran warrior, Count
               Nicholas of Salm, whose locks had now grown grey under arms. The mirth became louder,
               and the applause more vehement, till the Queen commanded silence and attention, for
               she too had prepared a little entertainment to celebrate the termination of that
               campaign which had threatened so much misfortune; well knowing that on such occasions
               her illustrious consort did not disdain to exchange the homage to Bacchus for a
               sacrifice to the Muses. Of this Monarch, indeed, it is recorded that when a certain
               Colonel of his Life Guards once ventured to hint that he bestowed too many favors on
               the learned, to the neglect of the ancient nobility, the Colonel next day received a
               great packet of old and important parchments, with an order that he <pb n="116"
                  xml:id="image151"/>should read them through, and in a few hours return a written
               abstract of their contents; the Colonel, of course, brought them back, declaring his
               incapacity for the task. "Good friend," said the King, smiling ironically, "you will
               for the future spare your animadversions on our patronage of the learned, for you
               perceive that if noblemen and warriors only were to be raised to office, the duties
               of the state would be fulfilled yet worse than heretofore."</p>
            <p>On a signal from the queen a red silk curtain at the bottom of the hall was suddenly
               drawn up, and revealed an altar from which a clear flame rose flickering, and
               illuminated the arms of Austria wreathed with laurel and gorgeously emblazoned.
               Before the altar sat a female form, beaming in such luxuriance of beauty, that she
               might well indeed have been deemed one of the muses descended from Mount Olympus. Her
               long white robes though rich in folds could not conceal the exquisite symmetry of her
               form; round her waist she wore a gold embroidered girdle, while from her shoulders
               waved a short mantle of blue velvet studded with golden stars. Her features were of
               the noblest Grecian mould; round her temples was bound a laurel wreath, and her
               glossy chesnut hair flowed in profuse curls round her blushing cheeks, down into her
               snow-white neck and bosom. In her arms she supported a harp, and accompanying her
               voice with powerful chords, sung <pb n="117" xml:id="image152"/>a fervent hymn in
               praise of the brave men by whose courage the threatening danger had been averted, and
               the proud plans of the Pagan invader defeated. Impassioned eloquence or music alone
               is enough to move irresistibly every feeling heart, — but how much is that effect
               encreased , when the tones flow from lips so beautiful, when such eyes beam with the
               sacred fire of inspiration! — A watchful silence prevailed in the hall that was
               before so loud with voices; the guests had eyes and ears only for the seraphic
               musician, who exercised her power like an enchantress even over the roughest veteran
               warriors "albeit unused to the melting mood," for she recalled to them and presented
               as if in a magic mirror the fairy dreams of their youth. How vivid then must have
               been the impression on younger auditors! Involuntarily all hearts were attracted and
               won by the lovely performer — every eye glistened with pleasure, and when she had
               finished her triumphant song, every tongue was busy in her praise — even the proud
               and haughty Baron Reichenstein was deeply moved. 'Till now, the attention which had
               often been bestowed on the young warrior by susceptible beauties of the capital had
               failed to excite any other sensation but that of gratified vanity. Now, however, when
               the songstress in her chaunt alluded to him as the announcing messenger of that that
               victory which he had assisted to gain, he could <pb n="118" xml:id="image153"/>no
               longer look proudly around, as he had been wont to do. On the contrary a deep blush
               came over his features; his proud heart beat anxiously, and his fiery eagle eyes were
               humbly fixed on the ground.</p>
            <p>So the festivities of the banquet were closed, and the evening of that happy day was
               spent in dancing and games of chance. For neither of these amusements was Baron
               Reichenstein disposed. Leaning against a pillar of the Gothic Hall, he followed with
               watchful eyes every movement of the Demoiselle Appollonia von Santi, — for so the
               beautiful songstress was named. Descended from a noble Greek house, and left in early
               youth an orphan, she had been brought to the Court of King Ferdinand, and there
               educated as one of the queen's maids of honour. Her beauty, — her eminent talents for
               music, and but still more the unpretending modesty of her demeanour excited universal
               attention, and every one spoke with respect of the beautiful Lady Appollonia. No
               sooner had she made her appearance in the ball-room than Reichenstein saw that the
               young and old crowded around her, to express their thanks for the delight which her
               music had afforded, and afterwards as she whirled past him in the walk, supported by
               some gay and brilliant courtier, he was racked by a feeling of the bitterest envy;
               yet he who had before known fear scarcely by name, had <pb n="119" xml:id="image154"
               />not the courage to approach her. With rapture he remarked, that even during the
               dance, his eyes often encountered hers, and when she seated herself for refreshment
               and rest, her looks again followed him as if she would say — "And you alone
               determined not to share in the pleasures of these fleeting hours?" So at last he
               mustered resolution, humbly approached the victorious enchantress, and in a
               faultering half audible voice begged that he might have the honour of her hand for
               the next dance. Appollonia blushed and courtesied her consent; the warlike hero made
               an awkward bow, and retreated, not daring to say more, 'till the music recommencing
               called them to their places. Reichenstein, who was usually a good waltzer could now
               scarcely keep in time, while his lovely partner seemed to partake of his
               embarrassment, yet this was but for a few minutes; her sparkling eyes and approving
               smiles soon roused him to self-possession. Even the musicians seemed inspired; they
               played louder, and with more precision. Envied by many a youth in the numerous
               assemblage, he flew down the ranks, with the peerless Grecian on his arm, and all
               allowed that there never was seen a more beautiful couple. On returning to their
               seats, Appollonia challenged her partner to give her some account of the Blockade.
               Reichenstein had now recovered from his awkward timidity, and contrived to tell his
               story with un-<pb n="120" xml:id="image155"/>wonted eloquence, enlivened and rewarded
               all the while by the approbation which he read unequivocally in the bright eyes of
               his auditress. Appollonia's attention was indeed so absorbed that she forgot the
               dance, and the presence of the court, so that the marshal was obliged to remind her
               of her duty, for the queen had already proposed to break up the party.</p>
            <p>Henceforward Reichenstein saw the young lady almost every day, and continued always
               to discover new charms and fresh virtues, — and this at length drew from him a
               confession of his love, and a request for her hand in marriage. Appollonia in answer
               explained to him that her fate depended on the king, who had hitherto acted towards
               her as a father, and who therefore possessed the full parental authority.
               Reichenstein heard this with fear and trembling; for he suspected that Ferdinand
               might have other views for his fair adopted daughter. He knew how much the king
               delighted in Appollonia's talents, by which his mind was often exhilarated after the
               cares of public business, and with which amusement it could not be supposed that he
               would willingly dispense. It was necessary therefore to watch for some favourable
               opportunity, when the king should appear in especial good humour, before the subject
               could be broached, and ere long, such a fitting occasion presented itself to the
               anxious lover.</p>
            <pb n="121" xml:id="image156"/>
            <p>The disaffected Bohemians, whom Ferdinand had a few years ago severely chastised,
               happened to lose by an accidental fire great part of the national archives, and their
               most important charters or deed of immunity. Conscience-stricken, and fearful that
               advantage might be taken of this event, whereby they might be deprived of many
               valuable privileges, they sent a deputation to Linz, in order to treat with their
               monarch on the subject. Scarcely had Ferdinand heard their preamble, when he
               exclaimed angrily — "Your charters may be destroyed, but our imperial promise, and
               principles of integrity, are not destroyed along with them. All the rights and
               privileges of which this fire has robbed you, we shall renew; and, where there is
               doubt, rather than give you less, we shall make your advantages greater than before."
               Of that scene Reichenstein was a witness. "No," said he to himself, "it is impossible
               that a sovereign, who is thus so mild and equitable, should be harsh to me alone."
               And no sooner had the ashamed representatives left the audience-hall, than he threw
               himself at Ferdinand's feet, and stammered out his request. For a few moments he was,
               indeed, kept in agonising suspense, while the king looked at him silently and with a
               very grave aspect. At length he made a sign for the supplicant to rise, and said, "I
               cannot conceal that I shall be very unwilling to part with Mademoiselle de Santi. In
                  <pb n="122" xml:id="image157"/>her delightful music I must lose one of the best
               enjoyments of my life; — yet far be it from me to interfere on any selfish
               principles, with her future prospects or yours; — take her then, and be happy."</p>
            <p>What language could adequately describe the rapture of the lovers! Soon after, their
               marriage was solemnized with princely magnificence, and Reichenstein took his young
               bride to the family castle from which he derived his title, and which was situated in
               Upper Austria, in one of the most attractive districts of that beautiful country.
               Then, from far and near, flocked visitors to pay their homage at the festal mansion,
               more attracted, however, by the wondrous musical talents of the bride, than by the
               hospitable manners of the castle's lord. The young noblemen of the neighbourhood,
               especially, were numerous and unwearied in their attentions; and their admiration of
               the Lady von Reichenstein's improvisator songs was beyond measure fervent. The
               baron's pride was at first flattered by such universal applause; but that feeling
               soon yielded to another very different emotion. He began to fear that it was not
               merely the delight they experienced from her music, but much more their admiration of
               Appollonia's personal charms, which shone in the eyes of these gay and idle youths,
               so that by degrees jealously more and more deeply fixed her serpent stings into his
               very <pb n="123" xml:id="image158"/>heart. Yet far too proud to confess that he had
               become the prey of a passion so despicable, and sensible that her conduct was too
               scrupulously correct to warrant his avowal of any suspicions, he concealed his
               irritability as much as possible, though many times, by gloomy silence, or short
               monosyllabic answers, did he betray his inward discontent. Appollonia, conscious of
               her own innocence, was completely at a loss to fix on any cause for this change, and
               enquired anxiously the reason of his distress, — whereupon the proud baron, instead
               of imparting at once the source of his grief, and thus, for ever banishing the demon
               that haunted his house, was either moodily silent as before, or ascribed his
               depression to a transient attack of illness.</p>
            <p>Love is sharp-sighted. Appollonia thought that she had at last found out the real
               cause of his displeasure; and under the pretext that their present mode of life was
               far too fatiguing, she begged him to dismiss their guests, in order that they might
               henceforth live in retirement: but how could Reichenstein's haughty spirit submit to
               the idea of having appeared as a jealous husband? He insisted that the castle of his
               ancestors must remain open to every guest; and when Appollonia, under various
               pretences withdrew to the solitude of her own apartments, and the visitors with
               regret commented on <pb n="124" xml:id="image159"/>the absence of their beautiful
               hostess — but especially when ironical hints and conjectures were whispered round the
               festal board, regarding the reasons for her disappearance, his pride was more than
               ever wounded. He therefore entreated Appollonia, nay, commanded her, to appear as
               formerly at every banquet, and to enliven his guests by the exercise of her magic
               art. Under these circumstances, concluding that her former suppositions had been
               altogether erroneous, she obeyed him willingly, without disguising that the incense
               of praise lavishly bestowed was welcome and acceptable to her female heart.
               Reichenstein's gloomy discontent now increased visibly from day to day, and it was
               only in the presence of strangers that his jealousy was overcome or concealed by the
               determination to appear gay and unembarrassed. In vain did his affectionate wife
               enquire into the cause of such inexplicable conduct. Two whole years thus passed
               away, during which that abode of his ancestors, where the spirit of domestic
               happiness should have woven for him the richest and brightest wreaths, was changed by
               his own imperious temper, and haughty and foolish reserve, into a cell of torment and
               ceaseless disquietude.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Solyman, in order to revenge himself for the loss and disgrace which he had
                  encoun-<pb n="125" xml:id="image160"/>tered, prepared to renew the war more
               formidably than ever, and made such an attack on Styria and Austria, that the Emperor
               Charles, in person, at the head of a considerable army, came to the assistance of the
               king, his illustrious brother. Ferdinand at the same time hastened to collect around
               him his faithful troops, and the rumour of these proceedings having reached the
               secluded castle of Reichenstein, the baron determined that he would immediately
               resume the duties of his station in the army. He had not yet been summoned; but alas!
               in his home there was no longer any domestic happiness that could induce him to
               remain there. In his wayward self-delusions he had cast it away; and in the tumult of
               the battle-field he best hoped to forget his vexations.</p>
            <p>The news of this approaching separation struck fearfully on the already wounded heart
               of Appollonia. When the dreadful hour of parting arrived, her anguish was indeed most
               sincere and overpowering, yet her foolish husband imagined that her tears and
               complaints were but a mask under which she concealed her joy at the prospect of being
               able in future to follow her inclinations without restraint. Unmoved, therefore, and
               sternly, he tore himself from her affectionate embraces, and galloped away, spurring
               his foaming charger, even as the <pb n="126" xml:id="image161"/>demons of jealousy
               and distrust goaded him on in his insane career.</p>
            <p>Now the once gay castle of Reichenstein became silent as a hermitage; — and like a
               widow mourning the death of a beloved husband, Appollonia withdrew from all society,
               living only for the care of his property, and ceaseless prayers for his welfare and
               preservation. Often at the midnight hour her attendants found her still at her
               earnest devotions, or listened with respectful sympathy as she touched her harp, and
               with tearful eyes expressed her grief, and even her prayers, in low faultering
               melody.</p>
            <p>Day after day, week after week dragged on, but no news arrived of Reichenstein,
               though she had earnestly requested that he would write to her. At length she found
               herself quite unable any longer to bear the racking pains of suspense, and dispatched
               her Castellan, a man of years and experience, with orders that he should make his way
               to the royal army, and by no means to return without some intelligence of her beloved
               husband. The interval of her messenger's absence she spent in continued prayer, and
               in acts of charity and benevolence.</p>
            <p>When the Castellan's return was announced, he was summoned immediately to her
               presence, but alas! — his features wore an expression of deep grief <pb n="127"
                  xml:id="image162"/>and disappointment. "Merciful God!" cried she, "my worst fears
               are then realized — and I shall never see him more!" She fainted, and not without
               great care and skill could her attendants restore her to self-possession — then it
               seemed that by direful and heroic exertion she had resolved to conquer her emotion,
               yet her bosom heaved convulsively, and her lips and eyelids quivered. "Speak on,"
               said she in a hollow voic — "relate all that thou know'st." "Forgive me," noble lady,
               said the messenger — "but I fear you are not well enough now to hear such tidings."
               "I know already that which is most appalling," answered she, "thou canst not tell me
               aught that could wound more deeply — say then, how and where did he die?" "Die!"
               exclaimed the Castellan — "God forbid that he should die — no, of this much be
               assured, your noble husband lives." "Lives!" exclaimed Appollonia, in a voice like
               that of the condemned victim on the scaffold, in whose ears for the first time sounds
               the voice of pardon, and who fears he may yet be deluded. — "Lives — saidst thou —
               lives?" "Aye indeed," said the Castellan, "but the Baron von Reichenstein is now a
               Turkish prisoner." "Oh, heaven be praised!" cried the enraptured wife, "his life then
               is yet spared;" and she fell on her knees, uplifting her clasped hands in fervent
               gratitude to the Giver of all Good for his <pb n="128" xml:id="image163"/>mercy.
               Thereafter she listened with calm attention to the Castellan's narrative.
               Reichenstein had been placed with a corps which was destined to oppose that of
               Michael Oglu, who was forcing his way with the van of the Turkish army over the
               Sommering mountains. In the heat of battle the Baron had advanced too far; he was
               quickly surrounded, and after a brave resistance, taken prisoner, and dragged away by
               the repulsed and fugitive Turks. Intelligence had been subsequently received by means
               of deserters, that he had fallen into the power of the Bassa of Belgrade, who, in
               consequence of his severe wounds, had obtained permission to return home, and had
               taken with him to his own country all his prisoners. "So then he lives — he is at
               Belgrade," cried Appollonia, "and there is hope that I may yet again call him mine!"
               With these words her tears flowed more freely than ever, but they were now tears of
               joy.</p>
            <p>For the rest of that day she remained shut up in her chamber, she would not speak
               with any one, nor accept of refreshment, but in the evening the castle chaplain was
               summoned to her presence. To him she explained that some affairs of great urgency and
               importance obliged her to go forthwith to the Queen's Court at Linz, and as the
               Castellan must attend her on the journey, the chaplain should, in their absence, <pb
                  n="129" xml:id="image164"/>use every means in his power for the due guardianship
               of the castle. The grey-headed priest not knowing the purpose of her journey, did not
               venture to remonstrate, and only implored that as her affectionate servants and
               vassals would deeply grieve for her absence, she would not long defer her return.
               With visible emotion she then took leave of her domestics, and at the earliest dawn
               of the next day, followed by the old castellan, and the blessing of all the Baron's
               vassals, she departed, taking with her only her harp, and wearing apparel.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Ritter von Reichenstein was obliged to fulfil menial drudgery as a
               slave in the gardens of Ibrahim, Bassa of Belgrade. At that time it happened that in
               his Harem there prevailed great affliction; Fatima, the most beautiful and beloved of
               his wives, had been driven to distraction by the death of her first-born infant
               child, and the violence of her sorrow had given way to an apathy and indifference
               which amounted to insanity. The unhappy Ibrahim offered the largest rewards for
               assistance, and tired every method to save his favourite from that untimely death to
               which the continuance of her malady would certainly lead. The most skilful physicians
               had recourse to all expedients of their art, but in vain; so that with an almost
               broken heart, Ibrahim saw that she was rapidly sinking into the grave.</p>
            <pb n="130" xml:id="image165"/>
            <p>One evening when he was under the dominion of these painful reflections, it was
               announced that a Grecian youth had made his appearance at Belgrade as a harp player
               and singer, with whose music every listener had been enraptured, and who had begged
               permission to prove his talents before the Bassa. Ibrahim gladly availed himself of
               the opportunity to obtain some diversion from his own gloomy thoughts; he desired
               that the stranger should be admitted forthwith, and was so much delighted with the
               youth's performance that as long as the music continued he quite forgot his usual
               sufferings. Thereafter the question occurred to him whether that magic art which had
               such influence over his emotions might not also alleviate the malady of his beloved
               Fatima. He imparted this idea to the stranger, who encouraged his hopes, and assured
               him that many instances were on record of insane persons being altogether restored to
               health by the power of music. "Should'st thou succeed in this attempt," cried the
               rejoiced Bassa, "then demand what thou wilt — no reward is too great, when the
               service performed is the preservation of my dearest Fatima."</p>
            <p>The Greek youth was duly instructed in the cause and symptoms of the malady, and
               undertook its cure. The attempt succeeded even beyond expectation. At first he was
               concealed behind a veranda, and ventured only to sing the most melan-<pb n="131"
                  xml:id="image166"/>choly lays in soft and long protracted notes, to which for some
               time Fatima seemed, as usual, indifferent, but by degrees her attention was roused,
               and she listened with visibly increasing interest. While the music continued, her
               beautiful features were once more animated, a slight tinge of colour rose into her
               cheeks, and a lambent fire shone in her eyes, but as the tones died away into silence
               she declined again into her wonted mournful apathy. By degrees she began to watch
               every word of the youth's songs, which like the music were plaintive and desponding,
               till her bosom heaved, and she wept unconsciously. Thus the trial was repeated for
               several successive days, and as often as the hour drew near which was appointed for
               the musician's attendance, she expressed anxiety and impatience; nay, once when by
               some accident he had been detained, she enquired if they intended to deprive her of
               her only remaining consolation. These words were the first that she had been heard to
               utter for many weeks, and from henceforward the Greek, at her request, came earlier,
               and remained longer. By degrees, too, he ventured to introduce songs that were less
               mournful, and the listener seemed even more gratified than before, till at length she
               begged to see the wonderful musician by whom she had been thus delighted; and even
               requested that he would give her instructions in his divine art. He obeyed <pb
                  n="132" xml:id="image167"/>willingly, and Fatima had soon learned a few simple
               ballads, which she practised passionately night and day, thus forgetting her
               misfortunes, so that she was ere long restored to perfect health.</p>
            <p>The Bassa, rejoiced beyond measure at this result, did not fail to send for the
               musician. "Thou hast fulfilled thy promise," said he, "now demand thy reward, in
               order that I also may behave honourably. Be not afraid to ask too much, for Allah has
               made me rich by his exceeding bounties, but for the preservation of my best and
               dearest treasure I am indebted to thee." "Sir," answered the youth, "there is in the
               gardens of your Harem a noble German soldier, the Ritter von Reichenstein, a captive
               who now labours there as a slave. It so happens that I have been deeply indebted to
               his house, and therefore if you are pleased to give up to me the liberty of this man,
               I shall be amply and richly rewarded." "Take him hence then," said the Bassa, "and
               along with him, if thou wilt, ten of his fellow soldiers, who have hitherto shared
               his fate. Moreover, it shall not be said that the Bassa Ibrahim sent any man out into
               the wide world to find his way home as a mendicant; he shall therefore be amply
               provided for; and thou, too, modest youth, shalt not leave my palace unrewarded."
               Hereupon Ibrahim summoned the overseer of his slaves, commanding him to lead the
               Greek youth into the prison of the Christians, to <pb n="133" xml:id="image168"
               />inform the Baron and his companions that they were free, and present to them the
               noble Greek youth as their deliverer. In vain did the humble minstrel strive against
               this — the Bassa's resolution was inexorable, "for it is no more than justice," said
               he, "that these Christian dogs should learn to know their benefactor, and offer him
               due thanks for his disinterested benevolence."</p>
            <p>Miserable embarrassed, the young Greek followed the overseer, and entered a gloomy
               prison, where the captives were seated on the damp ground, strewed with rushes. No
               sooner had the overseer announced the purpose of his message than the overjoyed
               exiles threw themselves at their deliverer's feet, even kissed the hem of his
               garment, and wept in their excess of gratitude. "Be thankful to God," said the youth,
               in a faultering, scarce audible tone, "and may Providence guide you on your homeward
               journey!" "Stay, noble stranger," cried Reichenstein, as the minstrel would have
               hastily retired — "if you will not listen to our humble protestations of gratitude,
               yet at least accept from my hands this insignificant ring. Should you, or any of your
               friends ever come to Germany, and pass near the castle of Reichenstein, this little
               token will open for the traveller a new home, and make him an acknowledged inmate of
               a noble family, whose last remaining chief you <pb n="134" xml:id="image169"/>have
               thus contributed to uphold." "We shall meet again," stammered the youth, with obvious
               emotion, and taking the ring, rushed from the prison as though he dared not trust
               himself in any farther colloquy.</p>
            <p>The Bassa's promises were faithfully fulfilled. Enriched by valuable presents, and
               attended by a secure escort, Reichenstein, along with his companions, left Belgrade.
               They arrived in safety at the Christian camp, and were all most kindly received by
               King Ferdinand, especially Reichenstein, who still expressed his wish and resolution
               to remain with the army. "In the first place," answered the King, "it is our will and
               pleasure that you should appear before her Majesty at Linz. Should your inclinations
               alter when there, which I hope may be the case, you shall have free leave of absence
               from your military duties, for after the oppressions you have undergone, this
               indulgence is but just and necessary. If however your determination should remain
               unshaken, the presence of so brave a soldier as the Baron von Reichenstein will
               always be welcome to our army."</p>
            <p>In the royal palace of Linz, after an interval of three years, the baron once more
               sat in the great hall at the banquet table, though now the party was less numerous,
               consisting only of the queen, her maids of honour, and some old coutiers. He <pb
                  n="135" xml:id="image170"/>again beheld the same golden framework of the folding
               doors, and the same red curtain which had formerly risen at the queen's signal, and
               afforded the first view of that peerless beauty, whom afterwards he was so fortunate
               as to call his own. With bitter regret he thought of that happy day, and all the
               fairy visions that had shone so brightly, and were now fled for ever. He sighed
               deeply, and the queen observing his distress, interrupted his contemplations with the
               words — "If I interpret your looks aright, that curtain revives recollections of the
               good fortune, which was here unexpectedly prepared for you, and I can well explain
               that sigh with which your longing heart has reverted to home and a beloved wife." A
               cloud came over Reichenstein's expressive features, and a yet deeper sigh was his
               only answer.</p>
            <p>"Nay, then, perhaps you have received some disquieting letters," said the queen, "and
               I doubt not that Appollonia's grief at your long absence — "</p>
            <p>"Appollonia's grief, indeed!" interrupted the baron with bitter irony; "your majesty
               must forgive me if I venture to doubt that any such cause — "</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay," answered the queen, "we must hear no more of this. I shall not allow
               myself to believe that unworthy suspicions could ever find harbour in your bosom. For
               the present, let us hear <pb n="136" xml:id="image171"/>minutely how you contrived to
               escape from the Turkish prison?"</p>
            <p>The Ritter went through his narrative accordingly.</p>
            <p>"But your deliverer," observed the queen; "that noble-hearted Greek — have you then
               never seen him since your meeting in prison?"</p>
            <p>"Alas, no!" answered the baron; "and the manner in which he then took leave obliges
               me to fear that I shall never in this world be so happy as to see my generous
               benefactor again, in order to prove how deep and sincere is my gratitude."</p>
            <p>"While there is life there is hope," said the queen; "could you have believed, three
               years ago, that yonder curtain, which you no doubt looked on with contempt, concealed
               the beautiful songstress, who was destined to be your loving wife? What should you
               think, if its mystic folds should once more expand, and reveal the person of your
               kind deliverer?"</p>
            <p>"Your majesty is pleased to jest," said the baron with a melancholy smile.</p>
            <p>"Let us try," said the queen, "whether it is impossible to convert his infidel;" and
               at her signal the curtain was again drawn up. Again he saw the altar from which a
               bright flame rose and illuminated, not the Austrian arms, but those of the noble
               house <pb n="137" xml:id="image172"/>of Reichenstein; while beneath stood the Grecian
               youth, his large hat slouched over his features, and leaning on his harp.</p>
            <p>"Is it possible? my deliverer! my benefactor!" cried Reichenstein, and then rushed up
               to the apparition. At that moment the pilgrim's hat fell off; the grey-coloured dress
               was thrown aside; and Appollonia smiling in all her wonted loveliness, while tears of
               joy shone in her eyes, presented to him the ring which he had given as a token to the
               wandering minstrel. He stood silent and confounded.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said the queen in a solemn voice, "she it was — your affectionate and faithful
               wife, whom not all the fatigues and dangers of so long a journey could deter from her
               undertaking, to redeem out of wretched thralldom that still beloved husband, who, too
               haughty to confess the injustice of which he had been guilty, had destroyed her
               happiness and his own."</p>
            <p>Reichenstein meanwhile throwing himself prostrate on the ground, and forgetting all
               his wonted pride, had hidden his face in the folds of her garment. Appollonia would
               have raised him up, but he exclaimed vehemently, though in a voice broken by his
               emotion — "Never more dare I lift up mine eyes to her whom I have thus injured! No
               penance no humiliation can atone for that guilt which now <pb n="138"
                  xml:id="image173"/>cleaves to my conscience and of which the stain will never be
               effaced."</p>
            <p>"Nay," said Appollonia, "knowst thou not that of all duties in this world, there is
               none more easy for true love than to forgive, — that the fond heart may indeed be
               wounded and broken by faults, mistrust and injuries, yet will never thus be alienated
               from its idol?"</p>
            <p>So the happy couple rushed into each others embrace, forgetful of the spectators and
               all the world — nor was there one individual present, who did not sympathize in their
               emotion; even the queen herself burst into tears. Henceforward, Reichenstein
               cherished no other pride but that founded on possession of the most beautiful and
               faithful of wives. The Bassa of Belgrade's gifts might increase his worldly wealth,
               but not his happiness, for in the tried attachment of Appollonia, he had secured the
               richest of all earthly treasures; mutually placing unbounded confidences in each
               other, their path of life was evermore cheered by sunshine and strown with
               flowers.</p>

            <p>IT is hardly necessary to remind the reader that at the close of the Peninsular war
               orders were issued for the formation of an encampment in the neighbourhood of
               Bourdeaux, where the regiments which had been selected to reinforce Sir George
               Prevost in Canada, as well as to carry on hostilities along the shores of the United
               States, might assemble. It fell to the lot of the **** regiment of light infantry to
               form one of the corps appointed for the last-mentioned of these services. Having been
               attached to the left column of Lord Wellington's army we were stationed, when the
               above intelligence reached us, under the walls of Bayonne, at the distance of ten
               long day's march from the point of rendezvous; but we welcomed the communication with
               not less alacrity on that account, and <pb n="149" xml:id="image186"/>made ready, on
               the 14th May, 1814, to act in accordance with its tenor.</p>
            <p>Of the particulars of our journey I am not at present called upon to give any
               account, farther than that in all its stages, and in every circumstance connected
               with it, it was most delightful. The weather chanced to be peculiarly favorable. Not
               a shower of rain, or a blast of wind, overtook us during the whole of our progress;
               and though towards noon the heat usually became more oppressive than agreeable, we
               managed by starting every day an hour or two before sun-rise, to escape most of the
               inconveniences which might have otherwise affected us. Every thing moreover, animate
               and inanimate which came in our way, had about it an air of exquisite novelty. The
               costume and personal appearance of the people, the arrangement of their houses,
               fields, vineyards and gardens, the order of their domestic life, were to us perfectly
               new, and interesting. We struck into the Landes, on the morning of the third day, and
               if any of my readers have happened to visit that wild district, he will doubtless
               attest that one more singular, or more prolific in extraordinary spectacles, has
               seldom been pressed by the foot of a traveller [sic].</p>
            <p>Amidst the huge forests of pine which overspread the whole face of this region, there
               are scattered at wide intervals from one another, a few villages, or rather hamlets,
               remarkable for their extreme beauty, <pb n="150" xml:id="image187"/>and for the air
               of primitive simplicity and contentment which hangs over them. They consist, for the
               most part, of from ten to twenty cottages, the walls of which are composed entirely
               of wood, and the roofs uniformly covered with straw. Each stands apart in the centre
               of its own neat garden and enclosure, whilst to the distance of perhaps a quarter of
               a mile in every direction, a circle of cultivated fields encompasses the whole. It
               rarely happens that a stream of limpid and excellent water is wanting in the
               vicinity, and a church, suited to the humble charactor [sic] of its simple
               worshippers, was a conspicuous feature in every one of the hamlets that lay along the
               line of our march.</p>
            <p>The quarter-master-general had so arranged our route that we were every day enabled,
               after compassng [sic] a sufficient extent of ground, to encamp in the neighbourhood
               of one or other of these delightful villages. The inhabitants proved in all
               instances, as obliging, as their poverty and secluded course of existence authorised
               us to expect; and if the women were not always remarkable for personal beauty they
               were, at all events, invariably goodnatured [sic], and lively. It happened that on
               one occasion I had my feelings wrought upon to a degree beyond my anticipations; and
               as the affair appeared at the moment worthy of being noted down, perhaps even now it
               may be deemed not undeserving of mention.</p>
            <pb n="151" xml:id="image188"/>
            <p>The night of Saturday the 21st of May, having been spent in the village of St. Muret,
               at two o'clock on Sunday morning, our tents were struck and we were in motion. Our
               route lat, as usual during the preceding week over a deep sandy track, cut through
               the heart of a dreary pine-wood, and our journey, on account of the absence of a
               convenient spot for halting, proved to be particularly tedious and fatiguing. We had
               traversed something more than six leagues; the hour of noon was past, and the heat
               had become intense, when a sort of shout uttered at the head of the column gave
               notice, that a resting place was in view. The shout did not deceive us. The leading
               files had already emerged from the wood into the customary range of open country; and
               in little more than half an hour afterwards our camp was pitched in one [sic] the
               loveliest situations which it had occupied since the commencement of our
               progress.</p>
            <p>Unlike its fellow-hamlets, La Barbp the village, beside which we now halted did not
               stand in the midst of an extensive area of bare meadows, and low corn-fields. Meadows
               and corn-fields there doubtless were but their surfaces were beautifully diversified
               by the frequent interspersion of clumps of oaks and chesnuts [sic]; whilst numerous
               undulations in the ground produced a species of tasteful irregularity, which gave to
               the little landscape the <pb n="152" xml:id="image189"/> appearance, rather of a
               park, or gentleman's enclosure, than of lands portioned out into fourteen or fifteen
               different farms. A rivulet of the purest water issued from the forest upon the right,
               and flowing gently onwards, wound round the base of a green hill, upon which, about a
               stone's throw apart from the other buildings, was erected the village church. In the
               village itself I saw nothing to distinguish it from the others. It consisted as usual
               of wooden cottages, not one of which, in point of architecture or decorations could
               claim a superiority over the others. And even the very cure or vicarage, if such it
               deserved to be called, was nothing more than a cabin, clean and neat, indeed, but
               presenting the lowliest aspect.</p>
            <p>Every body [sic] knows, that Sunday is observed in a French village as a day, not of
               relaxation only, but of jubilee. We therefore found the villagers in their best
               attire, assembled on the green or common, round which their cottages stood; and as
               they came forward in a body to bid us welcome, they presented upon the whole, a very
               striking and picturesque appearance. The men were conspicuous for their jackets of
               coarse brown cloth, their grey or brown breeches, blue stockings and large wooden
               shoes, but it was in the garb of the women that the distinction paid to Sunday might
               be most readily <pb n="153" xml:id="image190"/>noted. The boddice [sic] laced up with
               blue or scarlet ribbon; the bright scarlet petticoat, made so scanty as to display
               the scarlet clock [sic] which ornamented the blue stocking, these, with the
               handkerchief tied round the head with more than ordinary care and neatness, gave
               intimation that the toilette for that day always occupied much time, and particular
               attention. All, however, seemed to enjoy the same excellent flow of spirits, and not
               a few of the younger had gladly availed themselves of our band, to continue the
               dancing which our approach had interrupted.</p>
            <p>As soon as the bustle of encamping came to a close, I directed my steps towards the
               church, with the design of joining in the devotions of these simple people, or at
               least, of offering up my own orisons, from within consecrated walls. In this,
               however, I was disappointed; the priest, it appeared, officiated at another village
               besides La Barbp, taking the one in the morning, and the other in the evening,
               alternately; and as on this day, divine service had been performed here in the
               morning, it would not be repeated. Though a little chagrined at this circumstance I
               nevertheless followed up my original design so far, as to take a hasty survey of the
               interior of the pile; and then proceeded to indulge a favourite whim, by strolling
               leisurely <pb n="154" xml:id="image191"/>through the humble cemetery by which it was
               surrounded.</p>
            <p>I found the churchyard moderately studded with green mounds, but wholly devoid of
               head-stones or columns to tell the names of the persons who slept beneath. Wooden
               crosses seemed to be the only species of monument erected by the people of La Barbp
               to the memory of their deceased relatives, and of these, though they were almost as
               numerous as the graves themselves, not one bore a word or letter of inscription. Even
               the garlands, which throughout most parts of France it is customary for the survivors
               to twine over the tombs of those whom they loved, were all, with a solitary
               exception, wanting here. Upon one cross, and one only, hung a wreath of flowers; and
               though the blackened hue of the wood told a tale of exposure to more than one summer
               and winter, the garland was fresh and fragrant, as if gathered and arranged this very
               morning. I was much struck with the contrast which the condition of this grave, as
               compared with the others, presented, and, sitting down, was beginning to give free
               vent to fancy, when the noise of approaching footsteps disturbed my reverie. I looked
               round, and beheld, advancing towards me, a man in the common garb of the country. His
               age seemed to be about three or four and thirty; but in his general appearance there
                  <pb n="155" xml:id="image192"/>was nothing at all remarkable except that an
               upright carriage, one empty sleeve, and a pair of monstrous mustachios, indicated
               that he had been a soldier, and had served in the memorable wars of his country. As
               he drew nearer, however, I examined him more closely, and observed, or fancied so, a
               peculiarly mild and even melancholy expression in his eye. Whether or not I was
               correct, little time was granted to consider, for he raised his hand to his hat and
               coming forward at once, with the freedom and frankness of his country entered with me
               into conversation.</p>
            <p>"I perceive, Monsieur," said he, "that the garland upon the cross which distinguishes
               this grave from those around it, has attracted your attention." I assented to his
               remark, and proceeded to inquire whether he could give me any information respecting
               the individual who had suspended it there, and the person to whose memory it was
               consecrated. "I can indeed, sir," answered he; "I can satisfy you fully on both these
               heads; it was I that gathered it, it was I that wove it, and it was I that hung it
               here; it is a task which I religiously perform on the return of every Sunday morning,
               and she to whom I dedicate my weekly offerings, was the best, as she was the
               loveliest maiden of the province. Perhaps you may desire to learn something of her
               history. If you will allow me to take the privilege of a brother soldier I <pb
                  n="156" xml:id="image193"/>can sit down beside you; and God help me, I shall
               derive as much satisfaction, though it be a melancholy one from relating the brief
               detail, as you can have from listening to it." I immediately, and with the utmost
               readiness, accepted his proposal, upon which the villager seated himself by my side,
               and began as follows:</p>
            <p>"I am a native of this place, as from my address and dialect you have doubtless
               already guessed. My name is Jean Baptiste, and my father, whose only child I am, is
               accounted the wealthiest and most skillful cultivator in all the department. You may
               perceive that bating the loss of this arm (and that occurred six years ago, ought not
               to tell against me), I am neither worse made, nor less personally attractive than my
               neighbours; whilst I can appeal to all that know me, whether my temper be not as
               mild, and my disposition as amiable, as those of any lad in these parts."</p>
            <p>I could not suppress a smile at this most characteristic display of French egotism.
               "Why Jean," said, laughing, "I thought you were going to tell me a tale connected
               with the fair tenant of this grave; but you seem more disposed to instruct me
               concerning your own good qualities and fortunes." "Ah! Monsieur," replied he, "you
               may smile if you please, and say on that point what you will; but <pb n="157"
                  xml:id="image194"/> believe me I speak the truth. Yet what availed all these
               advantages. Marie, the beautiful and gentle Marie, whom I loved with my whole heart,
               and to promote whose happiness I could have willingly sacrificed my life, would not
               listen to my suit. It is a fact, indeed it is, she slighted my accomplishments,
               undervalued my wealth, and preferred to me a poor neighbour, who had nothing to
               recommend him, that I, at least, could discover, except that he was of a less fair
               complexion, and possessed a tolerable share of bodily strength and activity. Well,
               well, I could not quarrel with the girl for that, nor yet forsake my friend because
               he supplanted me, for Lewis Charmont was my friend, and dear to me as my own
               soul.</p>
            <p>"It is hardly necessary to inform you, that La Barbp has been inhabited by the
               ancestors of those families which inhabit it now, since the day when the good saint
               first planted these forests, and stayed the sands from moving. Under these
               circumstances you will not be surprised to learn, that we are all accustomed to
               regard one another as brothers and sisters, and that the poorest man amongst us is
               not despised or treated as an inferior, by the richest. But though this be, and has
               ever been the case, it is still only natural that even in our small community
               particular friendships should bind individuals more closely to each other, than the
               tie of common regard which <pb n="158" xml:id="image195"/>binds the same individuals
               to the whole body. Such has long been the case with the Charmonts, the Clausels, and
               the Baptistes. Our ancestors loved one another from the remotest period; no change in
               worldly circumstances ever interfered with their feelings; our parents were as if
               they had descended from the same stock; and we *** I mean Lewis, Marie and myself ***
               inherited their attachment.</p>
            <p>"Lewis Charmont was by one year only, my junior; Marie Clausel was two years younger
               than he. From the very cradle we were companions and playmates; nay were more, ***
               Lewis was the brother of my adoption, and Marie was our sister. Ah! Monsieur, those
               were blessed days, when each holding a hand, we led the sweet girl forth towards the
               river, and seating her on the bank the one plied his rod and line, whilst the other
               chased the butterfly which she admired, or wove a wreath of wild flowers for her fair
               brow. But childhood passed away, and youth came, to make us acquainted with the true
               state of our feelings, and to teach us that we were rivals. We both loved Marie,
               loved her to absolute idolatry; yet we loved each other at the same time, and never,
               no not for an instant did a pang of angry jealousy rankle in our hearts.</p>
            <p> "As we approached to manhood, Lewis and I, differing widely in our propensities and
               pursuits became by degrees not less truly friends, but less fre-<pb n="159"
                  xml:id="image196"/>quently companions. Lewis was agile, daring and adventurous;
               field sports, violent bodily exertions, especially where danger was to be surmounted
               or difficulties overcome, carried him away from his home, and the operations of
               agriculture; whereas my habits and tastes were all quiet and domestic. I cultivated
               my father's fields, contentedly and cheerfully, and was never so happy, as when I
               found leisure to dress Marie's garden, and stock it with the rarest and choicest
               plants within my reach. Yet for all this, she rejected my addresses: she withdrew
               not, indeed, from my society, but she refused to listen to my vows, and her refusal
               was so mildly and so affectionately pronounced that I only loved her the more because
               I felt my suit was hopeless. The truth is, Monsieur, that her affections were already
               engaged. She preferred to me, (who was continually at her side,) him who bestowed but
               a small portion of his time or attention upon her; but spent whole days, and
               sometimes nights in the woods, only that he might bring home and present to her the
               head of a wolf or the skin of a bear.</p>
            <p>"In this condition affairs continued for some time. We never dreamed of concealing
               from each other how our affections were disposed of; on the contrary Lewis was all
               along aware that I loved Marie tenderly, and I was equally aware that Lewis loved her
               also; yet that either was preferred by her to the <pb n="160" xml:id="image197"
               />other we both continued ignorant, till an accident drew forth the secret.</p>
            <p>"Early in the year 908, there arrived in our village a sub-officer's party of
               Gendarmerie, bearing an order from the prefect of the department, to enrol [sic] four
               young men from the division of La Barbp, for the service of the army. Such an order,
               coming from such a quarter, could neither be disputed nor evaded; the names of all
               the villagers capable of bearing arms, were put into a cap, and that of Lewis
               Charmont came up. Lewis himself, naturally brave and enterprising, uttered no
               complaint against his fortune, but rather rejoiced, in the prospect of honor and
               advancement. Lewis continued as yet ignorant of the possession of Marie's affections,
               for though repeatedly urged, she had hitherto refused to acknowledge it, though now,
               however, concealment was at an end. A threatening separation effected that which
               years of intimacy and familiar intercourse had failed to effect; and in the
               bitterness of her agony she yielded a full confession. I was present when she assured
               him, that she lived for him and him alone; that his departure would be to her a blow
               which she could not survive; that she would not even desire to exist, did he abandon
               her. What could I do. I saw indeed that my own hopes were blighted, and that Marie's
               coldness sprang not from indifference, but from a positive predilec-<pb n="161"
                  xml:id="image198"/>tion for another. But that other was my friend; Marie I still
               loved as before; could I be contented to behold this misery! No, Monsieur, though
               naturally averse to a life of bustle and contention I determined on the instant, to
               volunteer in Lewis's room, I did so without so much as consulting him, and was
               accepted.</p>
            <p>"Not all the misery which in my quieter hours has followed up the reflection that
               Marie was lost to me for ever [sic]; not all the grief which was my lot when I
               committed her delicate form to the earth, have been able to efface the blessed
               recollection of the moment when the flushed cheek, and glittering eye I told her that
               her lover was free, and that they might thenceforth be happy together. Ah! Monsieur,
               that was indeed a moment of rapture, of rapture such as I shall never again
               experience when I heard her address me as her brother and preserver; when I felt her
               arms around my neck, and her warm tears upon my cheek, and received the sweetest and
               most rapturous kiss that the lip of woman ever bestowed! Oh! whole years of agony
               could not suffice to blot out the recollection of those moments; a life of pain were
               but a poor price to offer for their repossession! But they passed away; and I marched
               off, if not happy, at all events, satisfied that I had done my duty, and that there
               were two kind hearts which <pb n="162" xml:id="image199"/>beat in gratitude for me,
               whose own was little better than a blank.</p>
            <p>"My satisfaction was, however, but of short duration. I had sojourned but a few weeks
               at the dépôt, when the arrival of Lewis, as one of a fresh batch of conscripts, gave
               proof that the sacrifice which I had made had been to no purpose. A second call for
               recruits, it appeared, produced a second ballot; and the name of Lewis, as if heaven
               had decreed that he should not elude his destiny, was again among the number of the
               drawn. You may well believe that my friend for some time after his enlistment was
               melancholy enough, when I inform you that the very day was named which ought to have
               made Marie his own; yet he recovered his spirits by degrees, applied steadily to his
               drill and his duty, and bore himself as proudly, and was as much admired as any man
               in the ranks, when the detachment began its march to join the army in Spain.</p>
            <p>"Lewis and I were fortunate enough to be appointed to the same corps, and the same
               company, indeed we were comrades. We were fortunate too in being commanded by a brave
               and good officer; and to fill up our measure of good luck, were sent off to serve
               under one of the ablest and most humane generals whom France has produced. We were
               ordered to Catalonia, at that time the province of the gallant and <pb n="163"
                  xml:id="image200"/>generous St. Cyr. This happy combination of events naturally
               tended to make us look to the future with a less desponding gaze, and upon the past
               with greater resignation; we acknowledged that our lot might have been far less
               desirable, and we were contented.</p>
            <p>"No particular events befel [sic] us on our journey towards the frontier. On the
               whole, we were treated with sufficient consideration by the inhabitants, who bestowed
               on us a thousand wishes for our success and safe return, and we came up with the army
               just as it had taken its ground, and begun to make preparations for the siege of
               Rosas. You are, doubtless, aware, that the defence made by the garrison of that
               fortress was exceedingly obstinate and gallant. Though our trenches were gradually
               drawn to the very crest of the glacis, and our saps penetrated the escarpment, the
               governor refused to surrender; nothing therefore remained but to try the fortune of
               an assault, and for this perilous service volunteers were invited to offer.</p>
            <p>"The first man who presented himself on that occasion was Lewis Charmont. It was in
               vain that I reminded him of Marie, and of the necessity under which he lay of
               guarding his life, as far as circumstances would allow, for her sake. He only smiled
               at my remonstrance, and squeezing my hand, replied, that if he fell, Marie would
               honor his memory, and if he survived, he should be the more worthy of her, as <pb
                  n="164" xml:id="image201"/>he would have acted like a brave man, and earned a
               medal.</p>
            <p>"The assault took place, and was successful. The carnage on both sides was terrible,
               but the town fell, and Lewis escaped unhurt. That I rejoiced at his escape you will,
               I am sure, believe; yet let me be candid, I did envy him, for the first and only time
               in my life, when I beheld him next morning upon parade with the medal already
               suspended from his button. Bitterly did I upbraid myself that I had not volunteered
               also; and I resolved that he should never again earn a distinction to which I should
               not be equally entitled; nor was I without hope that even Rosas might be to me, as it
               had been to him, a theatre of renown. The citadel still held out, principally, I
               believe, through the exertions of your countryman, Lord Cochrane, and a few of his
               sailors; and it continued for many days to withstand all our efforts. I was one of
               those who thrice endeavoured to storm it, and were thrice repulsed; but the works
               were demolished at last by cannon shot, the English were compelled to abandon them,
               and we took possession of the ruins.</p>
            <p>"Worn out with the labours of a tedious and harassing siege, we fondly looked
               forward, now that the place had fallen, to the enjoyment of at least a few days of
               repose, but we were disappointed. The critical situation of Barcelona, at that period
               blockaded by the <pb n="165" xml:id="image202"/>enemy, called upon the general to
               make every effort for its preservation. It was by far the most important of all our
               possessions on that coast, for the loss of which hardly any success would have
               compensated; so St. Cyr having determined that it should not change masters through
               any negligence on his part, made ready, without a moment's delay, to succour it. On
               the evening of the day which saw our flag hoisted upon the ramparts of Rosas, the
               order to prepare was issued, and at an early hour next morning the whole army was in
               motion.</p>
            <p>"The direct road from Rosas to Barcelona leads, you must know, under the very guns of
               Hostalrech, a fortified town, which was then held by a numerous Spanish garrison.
               Conscious that any effort to force a passage must be attended by a heavy loss, and
               unwilling to waste time by reducing the fort, St. Cyr resolved to penetrate, as he
               best could, through the mountain; and having found a shepherd who professed to be
               acquainted with the different tracks, he took him for his guide. The man was no
               traitor. He conducted the column, by a difficult and circuitous route, round the hill
               upon which Hostalrech is built, and brought it in safety, after a perilous and
               fatiguing march, once more into the high road.</p>
            <p>"On this occasion Lewis Charmont and myself were both attached to the rear-guard. It
               was not very efficient in point of numbers, though the general was<pb n="166"
                  xml:id="image203"/>pleased to say that we were all brave men, on whom he could
               perfectly depend; and it came not off so well as the column which it was appointed to
               protect. During the earlier part of the day, indeed, we, like those in front of us,
               went on without beholding an enemy; but about four o'clock in the afternoon we
               suddenly found ourselves watched by a very superior force; which, in spite of our
               most strenuous efforts to prevent it, succeeded in throwing itself between us and the
               rear of the column. For and instant we fell back, as if uncertain what course to
               pursue; the main body, we were well aware, would not, and could not halt to succour
               us, they could not even spare reinforcements to bring us off, for the defile of
               Trientepasos was before them, which must be passed that night or never; there was,
               therefore, no help to be expected from that quarter. The idea of surrendering, whilst
               we had arms in our hands, could not be borne for a moment; more especially as we were
               not ignorant that he who became a prisoner to the Spaniards was less to be envied
               than his comrade who fell in battle. Though they exceeded us in numbers by four to
               one, we resolved to fight our way through them, and either to make good our passage,
               or perish in the attempt.</p>
            <p>"The Spaniards were advantageously posted on the brow of a wooded height, and galled
               us dreadfully, as we rushed on, with their fire, but our charge <pb n="167"
                  xml:id="image204"/>was decisive; for one instant they stood the shock, in the next
               we had pierced them. And now all was hurry and confusion; it was our business to
               escape, each man as he was best able, and we were not very scrupulous as to the
               means. We ran as fast as weariness would permit, preserving, however, for a time an
               irregular line, and stopping occasionally, as a convenient space offered, to check
               the pursuit by our fire; but at last even our skirmishing order was lost, and we fled
               and fought in files or singly, as chance or circumstances directed.</p>
            <p>"In this manner the tiraillading continued till hardly light enough remained for us
               to point our muskets, when Lewis, who throughout the whole affaire had kept by my
               side, fell to the ground. You will wonder when I tell you, that notwithstanding the
               situation in which we were placed, it never once occurred to me that my friend could
               be wounded; I imagined that he had merely lost his footing, and I stooped down, in
               the careless turn of mind which such a belief was calculated to create, in order to
               assist him in rising. What then were my sensations when I found that he made no reply
               to my inquiries, and on examining him more closely, discovered that a musket ball had
               struck him just where the shoulder joins the neck, and passed into his vitals. My
               very brain swam round, yet I retained self-command sufficient to raise him in my
               arms, and to entreat that he <pb n="168" xml:id="image205"/>would exert his utmost
               strength, as the fire was fast slackening. He did so, and I led him to the rear; but
               we had not proceeded a dozen paces before he exclaimed in a feeble voice, 'It is
               useless, Baptiste, I cannot proceed farther. Go, go you, save yourself for poor
               Marie, and leave me to die.' I could not act thus, Monsieur; it was not in my nature
               to abandon any one, more especially the friend of my heart, under these
               circumstances; so partly carrying, and partly dragging, I contrived to hurry him
               along, till a cottage opportunely offering, I conveyed him into it. It was deserted
               and in ruins; yet with a winter's night closing rapidly upon us, I was too thankful
               even for such a shelter to pass it by.</p>
            <p>"The firing had now ceased; our people having made good their retreat, and the enemy
               fallen back to Hostalrech; but that was a matter about which I was perfectly
               regardless. I thought only of my friend, for whom the plundered hut afforded no
               comforts, and but a very partial shelter. I laid him upon the mud floor, and tearing
               my handkerchief into shreds, attempted to staunch the blood which welled from his
               broken limb; but all my efforts were fruitless, it flowed in spite of them. When I
               looked at his countenance, too, that told me plainly enough that there was no hope;
               the half-closed eye and fallen jaw, not less than the pale lit and livid cheek,
               warned me that Lewis was departing. Wild with my own <pb n="169" xml:id="image206"
               />fears, I called upon him in the name of Marie, and of all the tender associations
               connected with his native village, to rally himself, and take courage; and at last,
               finding that he paid no heed to my adjurations, I sat down beside him in despair,
               buried my face in my hands, and wept aloud. The sound of my lamentation reached him
               even in his last moments; he looked up, and in a tone scarcely audible, exclaimed,
               'Do not weep, Baptiste, do not weep, it must be thus, we must all die. Tell Marie
               that I fell as became me; and give her my medal, that she may occasionally look upon
               it, and remember me when I am gone. Tell her, likewise, that with my last breath I
               consigned her to you; you love her, Baptiste, that I know; and I need not add be kind
               to her, for to whom was my friend ever unkind? May you be happy together, and the
               thought that you are so *** .' He could not finish the sentence; no doubt he meant to
               say, that his spirit would look down upon our happiness with delight, but the word
               died upon his lips, the lips themselves ceased to move, and he was a corpse.</p>
            <p>"Ah, Monsieur, if you have ever known what it is to witness the dissolution of a
               friend who was dear to you as the air which you breathed, then, and then only, will
               you be able to imagine what my feelings were at this moment. Alas! I could not even
               pay to him the last tribute of friendship; I could not lay him in a grave; but I did
               what I could; I took his <pb n="170" xml:id="image207"/>medal from his breast, and
               fetching a quantity of straw from an adjoining chamber, I spread it over him; I knelt
               down, too, and breathed a fervent prayer for his soul's repose; and then with swollen
               eyes, and a heavy heart, set out to overtake my regiment.</p>
            <p>"I need not pursue the remainder of my story with any particular minuteness. I came
               up with the corps at the farther mouth of the defile, for the Spaniards, contrary to
               all expectation, had permitted us to thread it unmolested; and I partook of the
               bivouac which they had formed on the plain of Llenas. But our repose was of short
               continuance; the dawn had just begun to break when a heavy column showed itself in
               full march towards the pass; no doubt could exist as to the force which composed the
               column; so the drums beat to arms, and in five minutes after the army was in
               line.</p>
            <p>"Of the action which ensued, and which ended in the total defeat of the Spaniards, I
               cannot pretend to give any account, for the cannonade had scarcely begun when a round
               shot struck me in the left arm, and took it off. I was carried from the field along
               with hundreds besides, and having suffered amputation, was removed to a crowded
               hospital, where, during many weeks I endured all the misery attendant upon inadequate
               accommodation, imperfect nursing, and scanty provisions. At last, however, <pb
                  n="171" xml:id="image208"/>thanks to a naturally good constitution, I recovered;
               and being no longer serviceable, I received my discharge, but no pension was allowed
               me; I had not served long enough, it appeared, to merit one; indeed I was left to
               make my way, as I best might, through the whole breadth of France, without receiving
               any assistance than that which private benevolence afforded. Thus mutilated, and a
               beggar, I reached my home exactly ten months from the day on which I quitted it.</p>
            <p>"And now, Monsieur, it only remains for me to repeat the saddest portion of my story.
               Poor Marie had received no account of her lover since he departed, and had pined and
               languished after him, like a bird robbed of her young. Her health, naturally
               delicate, was already impaired by suspense; how then could it be expected that she
               would bear up against the terrible reality; she did not, Monsieur. I broke the matter
               to her as delicately as I could, but even thus she was unable to bear it; the
               intelligence that Lewis was no more came upon her like a thunderbolt upon a bruised
               reed *** it crushed her. When I strove to cheer her by making mention of her lover's
               valour, her tears only flowed the faster; and when I pulled out his medal, and gave
               it to her as his last bequest, it seemed as if her heart would have broken. She took
               it, laid it upon her bosom, and to her dying day kept it there; nay, it was not
               removed from her even <pb n="172" xml:id="image209"/>in death, it is buried in her
               grave. No, no, Monsieur, I could not speak to one, thus afflicted, of new ties; I
               never told her that Lewis had bequeathed her to me. The poor stricken doe had no
               pasture to fly to; she lingered on for a while, and died.</p>
            <p>"Six years and a half have passed since we laid her in the dust; she had then barely
               completed her twenty-first year, and the merciful God never took to himself a purer
               or a chaster spirit. For me, it has ever since been my chief delight to deck her
               grave, as you see it even now. Every Sunday I gather fresh garland for the purpose;
               and as long as life remains, I will continue the practice."</p>
            <p>Though there was something French in this poor fellow's story, I was, upon the whole,
               a good deal affected by it; and deeming it not unworthy of a place in my scrap-book,
               I noted it down.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS soon as I heard your daughter Tullia was dead, I confess I was extremely
               concerned, as it became me to be, at a loss which I regarded as common to us both;
               and if I had been with you, I should not have been wanting to you, but should have
               openly testified the bitterness of my grief. 'Tis true this is but a poor and
               miserable consolation, because those who ought to administer it, I mean our nearest
               friends and relations, are almost equally affected with ourselves, nor can they
               attempt it without shedding many a tear: so that they appear to be more in want of
               comfort themselves than to perform that duty to others. I resolved, however, to set
               down in a short letter to you such considerations as occurred to my mind, not because
               they can have escaped you, but because I think that your grief has hindered your
               attending to them. What reason is there why you should be transported by so
               immoderate a grief: consider how fortune has <pb n="184" xml:id="image223"/>hitherto
               dealt with us; consider that we have lost what ought to be dearer to us than our own
               offspring, our country, our credit, dignity, and all our honours. This one misfortune
               more, how can it increase our misery? Or what mind is there that has been subject to
               such distress, but must have now grown callous, and regard every thing else as of
               little consequence? Is it for her sake that you grieve? But how often must you have
               fallen into that train of thinking into which I often fall, which suggests to me that
               those persons are not the most unfortunate at this time who are permitted to exchange
               life for death? What is there now which could make her so much regret the loss of
               life? What affairs? what [sic] hopes? what [sic] prospects of comfort? Was it that
               she might pass her life with some Nobleman of high rank and qualification? And can
               you really think that it was in your power, deservedly honored as you are, to choose
               out of our present youth, a son-in-law, to whom you might safely commit a child so
               dear to you? Or, was it that she might bear children from whose flourishing condition
               she might have drawn much pleasure? Who might have enjoyed a large fortune,
               transmitted to them from their parents? Who might have been candidates in turn for
               the honors of the state; and who might have employed their liberty in the service of
               your friends! Alas! which of these blessings was not taken <pb n="185"
                  xml:id="image224"/>away before she was in a condition to bestow them on others?
               But it is a most shocking thing to lose one's children. True, if it were not much
               more so to suffer and undergo what we now do. Give me leave to relate to you, what on
               a certain occasion afforded me some little comfort, and allow me to hope that it may
               have the same effect upon you. Upon my return from Asia, as I sailed from Ægina to
               Megara, on my right hand Piræus, on my left Corinth. These cities were at one time
               flourishing beyond imagination, but are now desolate and in ruins. Thus I began to
               ruminate with myself; alas! do we poor mortals resent it so much, if one of us dies,
               or is killed, whose life is of so short a date, when we see in one spot the many
               carcases [sic] of so great cities lying before us? Will you not, Servius, check your
               grief by recollecting that you are born a man? Believe me I was not a little
               comforted by that thought. If you please, therefore, try the power of it on yourself.
               It was but lately we saw many famous men perish, a great empire declining and all the
               provinces in the utmost distress. And shall the death of one little woman so
               grievously afflict you! Who if she had not died now, must in a few years have done
               so; for she was born a mortal. Let me beg of you therefore, as much as is in your
               power, to call off your <pb n="186" xml:id="image225"/>mind from brooding over these
               subjects, and to turn it rather on such as are worthy of your character; consider,
               that she lived as long as it was desirable for her to live; that her fate was joined
               to that of her country, that she lived to see her father, Prætor, Consul, and Augur;
               had been married to youths of the greatest distinction; had enjoyed all manner of
               happiness: and fell at last with the republic. Upon what account can you or she
               complain of fortune? Above all, do not forget that you are Cicero, one who is
               accustomed to advise and direct others; and do not imitate bad physicians, who in the
               disorders of others profess that they are conversant in the art of physic, and are
               not able to cure themselves; but rather follow what you recommend to others and keep
               it constantly before your eyes. There is no grief which length of time will not
               diminish and soften, it is beneath you to wait for that moment, and not to master
               your grief, beforehand by your wisdom. But if there be any feeling in the dead, I am
               certain that she is very desirous that you should not wear yourself out with grief
               for her sake, on account of her filial piety and affection for you. Grant this favor
               to her, who is now dead and to the rest of your friends and relations, who sympathise
               with you in your grief, grant it also to your country, that, if she be in want of
               your assistance, she may be able to make use of your counsel and advice. And last of
               all, since we are fallen into such a situation, that we <pb n="187" xml:id="image226"
               /> must submit to the present state of things, do not put it in the power of any one
               to say, that you grieve less for your daughter, than you do for the misfortunes of
               the country and for the victories of her enemies. It does not become me to write to
               you any more concerning this affair lest I should appear to distrust your prudence.
               Wherefore, when I have mentioned this one piece of advice, I will conclude my letter.
               We have seen you bear prosperity in a manner that became you, and acquire great glory
               from it; now let us perceive that you can bear adversity with equal fortitude, and
               that you are no more oppressed by it than you ought to be: lest this should appear to
               be the only virtue you want among so many. But as to what belongs to me, when I
               understand that you are a little more composed, I will inform you concerning what
               passes here and in what state this province is. Adieu.</p>

            <p>I WISH, indeed, Servius, as you write, that you had been here when this misfortune
               befel [sic] me; for I easily understand from the quiet the reading of your letters
               administered to me, how much if you had been present, you might have assisted in
               consoling me, and almost equally sharing in my grief; for you have not only written
               such things as have alleviated my grief, but have very kindly sympathized with me.
               However you son Servius has testified by all those serviceswhich could be rendered to
               me, not only how much he esteems me, but how much he thinks you will be pleased with
               his kindness towards me *** whose good offices, though often upon pleasanter
               occasions, have never been more welcome to me than at this time. But it is not what
               you say in your letter, and the share you take in my affliction, but your authority
               also which has consoled me; for I think it unworthy of me not to bear my mis-<pb
                  n="189" xml:id="image228"/>fortune, as you who are endowed with so much wisdom,
               think I ought to do. But I am sometimes oppressed, and can hardly resist my grief;
               because those comforts are wanting which were not wanting to these, whom I have
               proposed to myself as patterns. For both Q. Maximus, who lost his son after he had
               been consul, and rendered himself famous by great actions; and L. Paulus, who was
               deprived of two sons in the compass of seven days, as well as your Gallus and Marcus;
               Cato who left a son of the greatest genius and virtue, all these lived at a time when
               their own dignity, which they had received at the hands of the republic, was alone
               able to alleviate their grief. But after I had lost those ornaments which you have
               mentioned, and which I had with much labour obtained, this was the only comfort left
               me, which I am now deprived of.</p>
            <p>My thoughts were not employed on the affairs of friends, or in the affairs of the
               republic. It was irksome to me to do any thing in the Forum, and I could not even
               bear the sight of the Senate House. I thought what was very true, that I had lost all
               the fruits of my industry and fortune. Yet when I reflected that these things were
               common to me with you and many others; and when I was forcing myself to bear these
               things tolerably, I had a person to whom I could fly, with whom I could be at east,
               and in whose conversation and sweetness of manners I could lose all my cares and
               vexations. But this has opened<pb n="190" xml:id="image229"/>again all my former
               wounds, which appeared to be healing. For it is not now as it was then, when my
               family relieved my concern for the affairs of the republic; neither can I fly for
               consolation under my private misfortunes to the prosperity of the republic. Therefore
               I absent myself as well from my own house as from the forum; because my own house is
               not able now to console me under the grief which I receive from the republic, nor the
               republic under the grief which I receive from my own private affairs. Wherefore I
               anxiously wait for you, and am very desirous of seeing you. No greater pleasure can I
               now receive, than in your conversation and friendship; and I hope, and indeed have
               heard, that your return will soon afford me this consolation. I am desirous in truth
               of seeing you as soon as possible for many reasons, but particularly that we may
               settle together our plan of life in this conjecture, which must be arranged according
               to the will of one man, who is prudent and liberal, a great friend as I conceive of
               yours, and no enemy of mine. Still it demands no small deliberation what measures we
               must take; I do not mean for acting, but for remaining quiet, with his permission and
               good will. Farewell.</p>

            <p>"IT grieves me," said an eminent poet once to me, "it grieves and humbles me to
               reflect how much our moral nature is in the power of circumstances. Our best
               faculties would remain unknown even to ourselves did not the influences of external
               excitement call them forth like animalculæ, which lie torpid till wakened into life
               by the transient sunbeam."</p>
            <p>This is generally true. How many walk through the beaten paths of every day life, who
               but for the novelist's page would never weep or wonder; and who would know nothing of
               the passions but as they are represented in some tragedy or stage piece? not that
               they are incapable of high resolve and energy; but because the finer qualities have
               never been called forth by imperious circumstances; for while the wheels of existence
               roll smoothly along, the soul will continue to slumber in her vehicle like a lazy
               traveller. <pb n="206" xml:id="image249"/>But for the French revolution, how many
               hundreds — <emph>thousands</emph>thousands — whose courage, fortitude and devotedness
               have sanctified their names, would have frittered away a frivolous, useless, or
               vicious life in the saloons of Paris! We have heard of death in its most revolting
               forms braved by delicate females, who would have screamed at the sight of the most
               insignificant reptile or insect; and men cheerfully toiling at mechanic trades for
               bread who had lounged away the best years of their lives at the toilettes of their
               mistresses. We know not of what we are capable till the trial comes; — till it comes,
               perhaps, in a form which makes the strong man quail, and turns the gentler woman into
               a heroine.</p>
            <p>The power of outward circumstances suddenly to awaken dormant faculties — the
               extraordinary influence which the mere instinct of self-preservation can exert over
               the <emph>mind</emph>, and the triumph of mind thus excited over physical weakness,
               were never more truly exemplified than in the story of HALLORAN THE PEDLAR.</p>
            <p>The real circumstances of this singular case, differing essentially from the garbled
               and incorrect account which appeared in the newspapers some years ago, came to my
               knowledge in the following simple manner. My cousin George C * * *, an Irish
               barrister of some standing, lately succeeded to his family estates by the death of a
               near relative; and no sooner<pb n="207" xml:id="image250"/>did he find himself in
               possession of independence than, abjuring the bar, where, after twenty years of hard
               struggling, he was just beginning to make a figure, he set off on a tour through
               Italy and Greece, to forget the wrangling of courts, the contumely of attornies, and
               the impatience of clients. He left in my hands a mass of papers, to burn or not, as I
               might feel inclined: and truly the contents of his desk were no bad illustration of
               the character and pursuits of its owner. Here I found abstracts of cases, and on
               their backs copies of verses, sketches of scenery, and numerous caricatures of
               judges, jurymen, witnesses, and his brethren of the bar — a bundle of old briefs, and
               the beginnings of two tragedies; with a long list of Lord N — — 's best jokes to
               serve his purposes as occasion might best offer. Among these heterogeneous and
               confused articles were a number of scraps carefully pinned together, containing notes
               on a certain trial, the first in which he had been retained as counsel for the crown.
               The intense interest with which I perused these documents, suggested the plan of
               throwing the whole into a connected form, and here it is for the reader's
               benefit..</p>
            <p>In the south part of the country of Kilkenny lived a poor peasant named Michael, or,
               as it was elegantly pronounced Mickle Reilly. He was a labourer renting a cabin and a
               little potatoe-ground; and <pb n="208" xml:id="image251"/>on the strength of these
               possessions, a robust frame which feared no fatigue, and a sanguine mind which
               dreaded no reverse, Reilly paid his addresses to Cathleen Bray, a young girl of his
               own parish, and they were married. Reilly was able, skilful, and industrious;
               Cathleen was the best spinner in the county, and had constant sale for her work at
               Kilkenny: they wanted nothing; and for the first year, as Cathleen said, "There
               wasn't upon the blessed earth two happier souls than themselves, for Mick was the
               best boy in the world, and hadn't a fault to <emph>spake</emph> of — barring he took
               the drop now and then; an' why wouldn't he?" But as it happened, poor Reilly's love
               of "<emph>the drop</emph>" was the beginning of all their misfortunes. In an evil
               hour he went to the Fair of Kilkenny to sell a dozen hanks of yarn of his wife's
               spinning, and a fat pig, the produce of which was to pay half a year's rent, and add
               to their little comforts. Here he met with a jovial companion, who took him into a
               booth, and treated him to sundry potations of whiskey; and while in his company, his
               pocket was picked of the money he had just received, and something more; in short, of
               all he possessed in the world. At that luckless moment, while maddened by his loss
               and heated with liquor, he fell into the company of a recruiting serjeant [sic]. The
               many-colored and gaily fluttering cockade in the soldier's cap shone like a rainbow
               of hope and promise before the <pb n="209" xml:id="image252"/>drunken eyes of Mickle
               Reilly, and ere morning he was enlisted into a regiment under orders for embarkation,
               and instantly sent off to Cork.</p>
            <p>Distracted by the ruin he had brought upon himself, and his wife (whom he loved a
               thousand times better than himself) poor Reilly sent a friend to inform Cathleen of
               his mischance, and to assure her that on a certain day, in a week from that time, a
               letter would await her at the Kilkenny post-office: the same friend was commissioned
               to deliver her his silver watch, and a guinea out of his bounty-money. Poor Cathleen
               turned from the gold with horror, as the price of her husband's blood, and vowed that
               nothing on earth should induce her to touch it. She was not a good calculator of time
               and distance, and therefore rather surprised that so long a time must elapse before
               his letter arrived. On the appointed day she was too impatient to wait the arrival of
               the carrier, but set off to Kilkenny herself, a distance of ten miles: there, at the
               post-office, she duly found the promised letter; but it was not till she had it in
               her possession that she remembered she could not read: she had therefore to hasten
               back to consult her friend Nancy, the schoolmaster's daughter, and the best scholar
               in the village. Reilly's letter, on being deciphered with some difficulty even by the
               learned Nancy, was found to contain much of sorrow, much of repentance, and yet more
                  <pb n="210" xml:id="image253"/>of affection: he assured her that he was far better
               off than he had expected or deserved; that the embarkation of the regiment to which
               he belonged was delayed for three weeks, and entreated her, if she could forgive him,
               to follow him to Cork without delay, that they might "part in love and kindness, and
               then come what might, he would demane himself like a man, and die asy," which he
               assured her he could not do without embracing her once more.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened to her husband's letter with clasped hands and drawn breath, but
               quiet in her nature, she gave no other signs of emotion than a few large tears which
               trickled slowly down her cheeks. "And will I see him again?" she exclaimed, "poor
               fellow! poor boy! I knew the heart of him was sore for me! and who knows Nance dear,
               but they'll let me go out with him to the foreign parts! Oh! sure they wouldn't be so
               hard-hearted as to part man and wife that way!"</p>
            <p>After a hurried consultation with her neighbours, who sympathised with her as only
               the poor sympathise with the poor, a letter was indited [sic] by Nancy and sent by
               the Kilkenny carrier that night, to inform her husband that she purposed setting off
               for Cork the next blessed morning, being Tuesday, and as the distance was about
               forty-eight miles English, she reckoned on reaching that city by Wednesday afternoon;
               for as she had walked to Kil-<pb n="211" xml:id="image254"/>kenny and back (about
               twenty miles) that same day, without feeling fatigued at all, "<emph>to
                  signify</emph>," Cathleen thought there would be no doubt that she could walk to
               Cork in less than two days. In this sanguine calculation she was however over-ruled
               by her more experienced neighbours, and by their advice appointed Thursday as the day
               on which her husband was to expect her, "God willing."</p>
            <p>Cathleen spent the rest of the day in making preparations for her journey: she set
               her cabin in order, and made a small bundle of a few articles of clothing belonging
               to herself and her husband. The watch and the guinea she wrapped up together and
               crammed into the toe of an old shoe which she deposited in the said bundle, and the
               next morning, at "sparrow chirp," she arose, locked her cabin door, carefully hid the
               key in the thatch, and with a light expecting heart commenced her long journey.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of remark that this poor woman who was called upon to play the heroine
               in such a strange tragedy and under such appalling circumstances, had nothing heroic
               in her exterior: nothing that in the slightest degree indicated strength of nerve or
               superiority of intellect. Cathleen was twenty-three years of age, of a low stature,
               and in her form rather delicate than robust: she was of ordinary appearance; her eyes
               mild and dove-<pb n="212" xml:id="image255"/>like, and her whole countenance, though
               not absolutely deficient in intelligence, was more particularly expressive of
               simplicity, good temper and kindness of heart.</p>
            <p>It was summer, about the end of June: the days were long, the weather fine, and some
               gentle showers rendered travelling easy and pleasant. Cathleen walked on stoutly
               towards Cork, and by the evening she had accomplished with occasional pauses of rest,
               nearly twenty-one miles. She lodged at a little inn by the road side, and the
               following day set forward again, but soon felt stiff with the travel of two previous
               days: the sun became hotter, the ways dustier; and she could not with all her
               endeavours get farther than Kathery, eighteen miles from Cork. The next day
               unfortunately for poor Cathleen, proved hotter and more fatiguing than the preceding.
               The cross road lay over a wild country, consisting of low bogs and bare hills. About
               noon she turned aside to a rivulet bordered by a few trees, and sitting down in the
               shade, she bathed her swollen feet in the stream and overcome by heat, weakness, and
               excessive weariness she put her little bundle under her head for a pillow and sunk
               into a deep sleep.</p>
            <p>On waking she perceived with dismay that the sun was declining: and on looking about,
               her fears were increased by the discovery that her bundle was gone. Her first thought
               was that the good people, (i.e. <pb n="213" xml:id="image256"/>
               <emph>the fairies</emph>) had been there and stolen it away; but on examining farther
               she plainly perceived large foot-prints in the soft bank and was convinced it was the
               work of no unearthly marauder. Bitterly reproaching herself for her carelessness, she
               again set forward; and still hoping to reach Cork that night, she toiled on and on
               with increasing difficulty and distress, till as the evening closed her spirits
               failed, she became faint, foot-sore and hungry, not having tasted any thing since the
               morning but a cold potatoe and a draught of buttermilk. She then looked round her in
               hopes of discovering some habitation, but there was none in sight except a lofty
               castle on a distant hill, which raising its proud turrets from amidst the plantation
               which surrounded it, glimmered faintly through the gathering gloom, and held out no
               temptation for the poor wanderer to turn in there and rest. In her despair she sat
               down on a bank by the road side, and wept as she thought of her husband.</p>
            <p>Several horsemen rode by, and one carriage and four attended by servants, who took no
               farther notice of her than by a passing look; while they went on their way like the
               priest and the Levite in the parable, poor Cathleen dropped her head despairingly on
               her bosom. A faintness and torpor seemed to be stealing like a dark cloud over her
               senses, when the fast approaching sound of footsteps roused her attention, and
               turning, she saw at her side a man <pb n="214" xml:id="image257"/>whose figure though
               singular, she recognised immediately: it was Halloran the Pedlar.</p>
            <p>Halloran had been known for thirty years past in all the towns and villages between
               Waterford and Kerry. He was very old, he himself did not know his own age; he only
               remembered that he was a "tall slip of a boy" when he was one of the — — regiment of
               foot, and fought in America in 1778. His dress was strange, it consisted of a woollen
               cap, beneath which strayed a few white hairs, this was surmounted by an old military
               cocked hat, adorned with a few fragments of tarnished gold lace: a frieze great coat
               with the sleeves dangling behind, was fastened at his throat, and served to protect
               his box of wares which was slung at his back; and he always carried a thick oak stick
               or <emph>kippeen</emph> in his hand. There was nothing of the infirmity of age in his
               appearance: his cheek though wrinkled and weather-beaten was still ruddy: his step
               still firm, his eyes still bright; his jovial disposition made him a welcome guest in
               every cottage, and his jokes, though not equal to my Lord Norbury's, were repeated
               and applauded through the whole country. Halloran was lreturning [sic] from the fair
               of Kilkenny, where apparently his commercial speculations had been attended with
               success, as his pack was considerably diminished in size. Though he did not appear to
               recollect Cathleen, he addressed her in Irish, and asked her what <pb n="215"
                  xml:id="image258"/>she did there: she related in a few words her miserable
               situation.</p>
            <p>"In troth, then, my heart is sorry for ye, poor woman," he replied, compassionately;
               "and what will ye do?"</p>
            <p>"An' what can I do?" replied Cathleen, disconsolately; "and how will I even find the
               ford of Ahnamoe and get across to Cork, when I don't know where I am this blessed
               moment?"</p>
            <p> "Musha, then, its little ye'll get there this night," said the pedlar, shaking his
               head.</p>
            <p>"Then I'll lie down here and die," said Cathleen, bursting into fresh tears.</p>
            <p>"Die! ye wouldn't!" he exclaimed, approaching nearer; "is it to me, Peter Halloran,
               ye spake that word; and am I the man that would lave a faymale at this dark hour by
               the way side, let alone one that has the face of a friend, though I cannot remember
               me of your name either, for the soul of me. But what matter for that?"</p>
            <p>"Sure, I'm Katty Reilly, of Castle Conn."</p>
            <p>"Katty Reilly, sure enough! and so no more talk of dying; cheer up, and see, a mile
               farther on, isn't there Biddy Hogan's? <emph>Was</emph>, I mane, if the house and all
               isn't gone: and its there we'll get a bite and a sup, and a bed, too, please God. So
               lean upon my arm, ma vourneen, its strong enough yet."</p>
            <pb n="216" xml:id="image259"/>
            <p>So saying, the old man with an air of gallantry, half rustic, half military, assisted
               her in rising; and upporting [sic] her on one arm, with the other he flourished his
               kippeen over his head, and they trudged on together, he singing Cruiskeen lawn at the
               top of his voice, "just," as he said, "to put the heart into her."</p>
            <p>After about half an hour's walking, they came to two crossways, diverging from the
               high road: down one of these the Pedlar turned, and in a few minutes they came in
               sight of a lonely house, situated at a little distance from the way-side. Above the
               door was a long stick projecting from the wall, at the end of which dangled a truss
               of straw, signifying that within there was entertainment (good or bad) for man and
               beast. By this time it was nearly dark, and the pedlar going up to the door, lifted
               the latch, expecting it to yield to his hand; but it was fastened within: he then
               knocked and called, but there was no answer. The building which was many times larger
               than an ordinary cabin had once been a manufactory, and afterwards a farm-house. One
               end of it was deserted, and nearly in ruins; the other end bore signs of having been
               at least recently inhabited. But such a dull hollow echo rung through the edifice at
               every knock, that it seemed the whole place was now deserted.</p>
            <p>Cathleen began to be alarmed, and crossed her-<pb n="217" xml:id="image260"/>self,
               ejaculating, "O God preserve us!" But the Pedlar, who appeared well acquainted with
               the premises, led her round to the back part of the house, where there were some
               ruined out-buildings, and another low entrance. Here, raising his stout stick, he let
               fall such a heavy thump on the door that it cracked again; and a shrill voice from
               the other side demanded who was there? After a satisfactory answer, the door was
               slowly and cautiously opened, and the figure of a wrinkled, half famished and half
               naked beldam appeared, shading a rush candle with one hand. Halloran, who was of a
               fiery and hasty temper, began angrily: "Why, then, in the name of the great devil
               himself, didn't you open to us?" But he stopped suddenly, as if struck with surprise
               at the miserable object before him.</p>
            <p>"Is it Biddy Hogan herself, I see!" he exclaimed, snatching the candle from her hand,
               and throwing the light full on her face. A moment's scrutiny seemed enough, and too
               much; for, giving it back hastily, he supported Cathleen into the kitchen, the old
               woman leading the way, and placed her on an old settle, the first seat which
               presented itself. When she was sufficiently recovered to look about her, Cathleen
               could not help feeling some alarm at finding herself in so gloomy and dreary a place.
               It had once been a large kitchen, or hall: at one <pb n="218" xml:id="image261"/>end
               was an ample chimney, such as are yet to be seen in some old country houses. The
               rafters were black with smoke or rottenness: the walls had been wainscoted with oak,
               but the greatest part had been torn down for firing. A table with three legs, a large
               stool, a bench in the chimney propped up with turf sods, and the seat Cathleen
               occupied, formed the only furniture. Every thing spoke of utter misery, filth, and
               famine — the very "abomination of desolation."</p>
            <p>"And what have ye in the house, Biddy, honey?" was the Pedlar's first question, as
               the old woman set down the light.</p>
            <p>"Little enough, I'm thinking."</p>
            <p>"Little! Its nothing then."</p>
            <p>"No, not so much as a midge would eat have I in the house this blessed night, and
               nobody to send down to Balgowna."</p>
            <p>"No need of that, as our good luck would have it," said Halloran, and pulling a
               wallet from under his loose coat, he drew from it a bone of cold meat, a piece of
               bacon, a lump of bread, and some cold potatoes. The old woman, roused by the sight of
               so much good cheer, began to blow up the dying embers on the hearth; put down among
               them the few potatoes to warm, and busied herself in making some little preparations
               to entertain her guests. Meantime the old Pedlar, casting from time to time an
               anxious <pb n="219" xml:id="image262"/>glance towards Cathleen, and now and then an
               encouraging word, sat down on the low stool, resting his arms on his knees.</p>
            <p>"Times are sadly changed with ye, Biddy Hogan," said he at length, after a long
               silence.</p>
            <p>"Troth, ye may say so;" she replied with a sort of groan. "Bitter bad luck have we
               had in this world, any how."</p>
            <p>"And where's the man of the house? And where's the lad, Barny?"</p>
            <p>"Where are they, is it? Where should they be? may be gone down to Ahnamoe."</p>
            <p>"But what's come of Barny? The boy was a stout workman, and a good son, though a
               devil-may-care fellow, too. I remember teaching him the soldier's exercise with this
               very blessed stick now in my hand; and by the same token, him doubling his fist at me
               when he wasn't bigger than the turf-kish yonder; aye, and as long as Barney Hogan
               could turn a sod of turf on my lord's land, I thought his father and mother would
               never have wanted the bit and sup while the life was in him."</p>
            <p>At the mention of her son, the old woman looked up a moment, but immediately hung her
               head again.</p>
            <p>"Barny doesn't work for my lord now," said she.</p>
            <p>"And what for, then?"</p>
            <p>The old woman seemed reluctant to answer — she hesitated.</p>
            <pb n="220" xml:id="image263"/>
            <p>"Ye didn't hear, then, how he got into trouble with my lord; and how — myself doesn't
               know the rights of it — but Barny had always a bit of wild blood about him; and since
               that day he's taken to bad ways, and the ould [sic] man's ruled by him quite
               entirely; and the one's glum and fierce like — and t'other's bothered; and, oh!
               bitter's the time I have twixt 'em both!"</p>
            <p>While the old woman was uttering these broken complaints, she placed the eatables on
               the table; and Cathleen, who was yet more faint from hunger than subdued by fatigue,
               was first helped by the good-natured Pedlar to the best of what was there: but, just
               as she was about to taste the food set before her, she chanced to see the eyes of the
               old woman fixed upon the morsel in her hand with such an envious and famished look,
               that from a sudden impulse of benevolent feeling, she instantly held it out to her.
               The woman started, drew back her extended hand, and gazed at her wildly.</p>
            <p>"What is it then ails ye?" said Cathleen, looking at her with wonder; then to
               herself, "hunger's turned the wits of her, poor soul! Take it — take it, mother,"
               added she aloud: "eat, good mother; sure there's plenty for us all, and to spare,"
               and she pressed it upon her with all the kindness of her nature. The old woman
               eagerly seized it.</p>
            <p>"God reward ye," said she, grasping Cathleen's <pb n="221" xml:id="image264"/>hand,
               convulsively, and retiring to a corner, she devoured the food with almost wolfish
               voracity.</p>
            <p>While they were eating, the two Hogans, father and son, came in. They had been
               setting snares for rabbits and game on the neighbouring hills; and evidently were
               both startled and displeased to find the house occupied; which, since Barny Hogan's
               disgrace with "my lord," had been entirely shunned by the people round about. The old
               man gave the pedlar a sulky welcome. The son, with a muttered curse, went and took
               his seat in the chimney, where, turning his back, he set himself to chop a billet of
               wood. The father was a lean stooping figure, "bony, and gaunt, and grim:" he was
               either deaf, or affected deafness. The son was a short, brawny, thickset man, with
               features not naturally ugly, but rendered worse than ugly by an expression of louring
               ferocity disgustingly blended with a sort of stupid drunken leer, the effect of
               habitual intoxication.</p>
            <p>Halloran stared at them awhile with visible astonishment and indignation, but pity
               and sorrow for a change so lamentable, smothered the old man's wrath; and as the
               eatables were by this time demolished, he took from his side pocket a tin flask of
               whiskey, calling to the old woman to boil some water "screeching hot," that he might
               make what he termed "a jug of stiff punch — enough to make a cat spake." He offered
               to share it with his hosts, who did not decline drinking; <pb n="222"
                  xml:id="image265"/>and the noggin went round to all but Cathleen, who, feverish
               with travelling, and, besides, disliking spirits, would not taste it. The old Pedlar,
               reconciled to his old acquaintances by this shew of good fellowship, began to grow
               merry under the influence of his whiskey-punch: he boasted of his late success in
               trade, shewed with exultation his almost empty pack, and taking out the only two
               handkerchiefs left in it, threw one to Cathleen, and the other to the old woman of
               the house; then slapping his pocket in which a quantity of loose money was heard to
               jingle, he swore he would treat Cathleen to a good breakfast next morning; and threw
               a shilling on the table, desiring the old woman would provide "stirabout for a
               dozen," and have it ready by the first light.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened to this rhodomontade in some alarm; she fancied to detect certain
               suspicious glances between the father and son, and began to feel an indescribable
               dread of her company. She arose from the table, urging the Pedlar good-humouredly to
               retire to rest, as they intended to be up and away so early next morning: then
               concealing her apprehensions under an affectation of extreme fatigue and drowsiness,
               she desired to be shewn where she would sleep. The old woman lighted a lanthorn, and
               led the way up some broken steps into a sort of loft, where she shewed her two beds
               standing close together; one of these <pb n="223" xml:id="image266"/>she intimated
               was for the Pedlar, and the other for herself. Now Cathleen had been born and bred in
               an Irish cabin, where the inmates are usually lodged after a very promiscuous
               fashion; our readers, therefore, will not wonder at the arrangement. Cathleen,
               however, required that, if possible some kind of skreen [sic] should be placed
               between the beds. The old hag at first replied to this request with the most
               disgusting impudence; but Cathleen insisting, the beds were moved asunder, leaving a
               space of about two feet between them; and after a long search a piece of old frieze
               was dragged out from among some rubbish, and hung up to the low rafters, so as to
               form a curtain or partition half way across the room. Having completed this
               arrangement, and wished her "a sweet sleep and a sound, and lucky dreams," the old
               woman put the lanthorn on the floor, for there was neither chair nor table, and left
               her guest to repose.</p>
            <p>Catheleen said her prayers, only partly undressed herself, and lifting up the worn
               out coverlet, lay down upon the bed. In a quarter of an hour afterwards the Pedlar
               staggered into the room, and as he passed the foot of her bed, bid God bless her, in
               a low voice. He then threw himself down on his bed, and in a few minutes, as she
               judged by his hard and equal breathing, the old man was in a deep sleep.</p>
            <p>All was now still in the house, but Cathleen <pb n="224" xml:id="image267"/>could not
               sleep. She was feverish and restless: her limbs ached, her head throbbed and burned,
               undefinable fears beset her fancy; and whenever she tried to compose herself to
               slumber the faces of the two men she had left below flitted and glared before her
               eyes. A sense of heat and suffocation, accompanied by a parching thirst, came over
               her, caused, perhaps, by the unusual closeness of the room. This feeling of
               oppression increased till the very walls and rafters seemed to approach nearer and
               close upon her all around. Unable any longer to endure this intolerable smothering
               sensation, she was just about to rise and open the door or window, when she heard the
               whispering of voices. She lay still and listened. The latch was raised cautiously, —
               the door opened, and the two Hogans entered: they trod so softly that, though she saw
               them move before her, she heard no foot-fall. They approached the bed of Halloran,
               and presently she heard a dull heavy blow, and then sounds — appalling sickening
               sounds — as of subdued struggles and smothered agony, which convinced her that they
               were murdering the unfortunate Pedlar.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened, almost congealed with horror, but she did not swoon: her turn, she
               thought, must come next, though in the same instant she felt instinctively that her
               only chance of preservation was to counterfeit profound sleep. The murderers, <pb
                  n="225" xml:id="image268"/>having done their work on the poor Pedlar, approached
               her bed, and threw the gleam of their lanthorn full on her face; she lay quite still,
               breathing calmly and regularly. They brought the light to her eye-lids, but they did
               not wink or move; — there was a pause, a terrible pause, and then a whispering; — and
               presently Cathleen thought she could distinguish a third voice, as of expostulation,
               but all in so very low a tone that though the voices were close to her she could not
               hear a word that was uttered. After some moments, which appeared an age of agonising
               suspense, the wretches withdrew, and Cathleen was left alone, and in darkness. Then,
               indeed, she felt as one ready to die: to use her own affecting language, "the heart
               within me," said she, "melted away like water, but I was resolute not to swoon, and I
                  <emph>did not</emph>. I knew that if I would preserve my life, I must keep the
               sense in me, and <emph>I did</emph>."</p>
            <p>Now and then she fancied she heard the murdered man move, and creep about in his bed,
               and this horrible conceit almost maddened her with terror: but she set herself to
               listen fixedly, and convinced her reason that all was still — that all was over.</p>
            <p>She then turned her thoughts to the possibility of escape. The window first suggested
               itself: the faint moon-light was just struggling through the dirty and cob-webbed
               panes: it was very small, and Cathleen reflected, that besides the difficulty, and,
                  <pb n="226" xml:id="image269"/>perhaps, impossibility of getting through, it must
               be some height from the ground: neither could she tell on which side of the house it
               was situated, nor in what direction to turn, supposing she reached the ground; and,
               above all, she was aware that the slightest noise, must cause her instant
               destruction. She thus resolved upon remaining quiet.</p>
            <p>It was most fortunate that Cathleen came to this determination, for without the
               slightest previous sound the door again opened, and in the faint light, to which her
               eyes were now accustomed, she saw the head of the old woman bent forward in a
               listening attitude: in a few minutes the door closed, and then followed a whispering
               outside. She could not at first distinguish a word until the woman's sharper tones
               broke out, though in a suppressed vehemence, with "If ye touch her life, Barny, a
               mother's curse go with ye! enough's done."</p>
            <p>"She'll live, then, to hang us all," said the miscreant son.</p>
            <p>"Sooner than that, I'd draw this knife across her throat with my own hands; and I'd
               do it again and again, sooner than they should touch your life, Barny, jewel: but no
               fear, the creature's asleep or dead already, with the fright of it."</p>
            <p>The son then said something which Cathleen could not hear; the old woman replied,</p>
            <p>"Hisht! I tell ye, no, — no; the ship's now in the <pb n="227" xml:id="image270"
               />Cove of Cork that's to carry her over the salt seas far enough out of the way: and
               haven't we all she has in the world? and more, didn't she take the bit out of her own
               mouth to put into mine?"</p>
            <p>The son again spoke inaudibly; and then the voices ceased, leaving Cathleen uncertain
               as to her fate.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the door opened, and the father and son again entered, and carried out
               the body of the wretched Pedlar. They seemed to have the art of treading without
               noise, for though Cathleen saw them move, she could not hear a sound of a footstep.
               The old woman was all this time standing by her bed, and every now and then casting
               the light full upon her eyes; but as she remained quiet still, and apparently in a
               deep calm sleep, they left her undisturbed, and she neither saw nor heard any more of
               them that night.</p>
            <p>It ended at length — that long, long night of horror. Cathleen lay quiet till she
               thought the morning sufficiently advanced. She then rose, and went down into the
               kitchen: the old woman was lifting a pot off the fire, and nearly let it fall as
               Cathleen suddenly addressed her, and with an appearance of surprise and concern,
               asked for her friend the Pedlar, saying she had just looked into his bed, supposing
               he was still asleep, and to her great amazement had found it empty. The old woman
               replied, that he had set out at <pb n="228" xml:id="image271"/>early day-light for
               Mallow, having only just remembered that his business called him that way before he
               went to Cork. Cathleen affected great wonder and perplexity, and reminded the woman
               that he had promised to pay for her breakfast.</p>
            <p>"An' so he did, sure enough," she replied, "and paid for it too; and by the same
               token didn't I go down to Balgowna myself for the milk and the <emph>male</emph>
               before the sun was over the tree tops; and here it is for ye, ma colleen [sic]:" so
               saying, she placed a bowl of stirabout and some milk before Cathleen, and then sat
               down on the stool opposite her, watching her intently.</p>
            <p>Poor Cathleen! she had but little inclination to eat, and felt as if every bit would
               choke her: yet she continued to force down her breakfast, and apparently with the
               utmost ease and appetite, even to the last morsel set before her. While eating, she
               enquired about the husband and son, and the old woman replied, that they had started
               at the first burst of light to cut turn in a bog, about five miles distant.</p>
            <p>When Cathleen had finished her breakfast, she returned the old woman many thanks for
               her kind treatment, and then desired to know the nearest way to Cork. The woman Hogan
               informed her that the distance was about seven miles, and though the usual road was
               by the high way from which they had <pb n="229" xml:id="image272"/>turned the
               preceding evening, there was a much shorter way across some fields which she pointed
               out: Cathleen listened attentively to her directions, and then bidding farewell with
               many demonstrations of gratitude, she proceeded on her fearful journey. The cool
               morning air, the cheerful song of the early birds, the dewy freshness of the turf,
               were all unnoticed and unfelt: the sense of danger was paramount, while her faculties
               were all alive and awake to meet it, for a feverish and unnatural strength seemed to
               animate her limbs. She stepped on, shortly debating with herself whether to follow
               the directions given by the old woman. The high road appeared the safest; on the
               other hand, she was aware that the slightest betrayal of mistrust would perhaps be
               followed by her destruction; and thus rendered brave even by the excess of her fears,
               she determined to take the cross path. Just as she had come to this resolution, she
               reached the gate which she had been directed to pass through; and without the
               slightest apparent hesitation, she turned in, and pursued the lonely way through the
               fields. Often did she fancy she heard footsteps stealthily following her, and never
               approached a hedge without expecting to see the murderers start up from behind it;
               yet she never once turned her head, nor quickened nor slackened her pace; </p>
            <pb n="230" xml:id="image273"/>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l rend="indent5">Like one that on a lonesome road</l>
               <l rend="indent5">Doth walk in fear and dread,</l>
               <l rend="indent5">Because he knows a frightful fiend</l>
               <l rend="indent5">Doth close behind him tread.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>She had proceeded in this manner about three quarters of a mile, and approached a
               thick and dark grove of underwood, when she beheld seated upon the opposite stile an
               old woman in a red cloak. The sight of a human being made her heart throb more
               quickly for a moment; but on approaching nearer, with all her faculties sharpened by
               the sense of danger, she perceived that it was no old woman, but the younger Hogan,
               the murderer of Halloran, who was thus disguised. His face was partly concealed by a
               blue handkerchief tied round his head and under his chin, but she knew him by the
               peculiar and hideous expression of his eyes: yet with amazing and almost incredible
               self-possession, she continued to advance without manifesting the least alarm, or
               sign of recognition; and walking up to the pretended old woman, said in a clear
               voice, "The blessing of the morning on ye, good mother! a fine day for travelers like
               you and me!"</p>
            <p>"A fine day," he replied, coughing and mumbling in a feigned voice, "but ye see,
               hugh, ugh! ye see I've walked this mornin' from the Cove of Cork, jewel, and troth
               I'm almost spent, and I've a bad <pb n="231" xml:id="image274"/>cowld, and a cough on
               me, as you may her," and he coughed vehemently. Cathleen made a motion to pass the
               stile, but the disguised old woman stretching out a great bony hand, seized her gown.
               Still Cathleen did not quail. "Musha, then, have ye nothing to give a poor old
               woman," said the monster, in a whining, snuffling tone. "Nothing have I in this wide
               world," said Cathleen, quietly disengaging her gown, but without moving. "Sure its
               only yesterday I was robbed of all I had but the little clothes on my back, and if I
               hadn't met with charity from others I'd have starved by the way side by this
               time."</p>
            <p>"Och! and is there no place hereby where they would give a potatoe and a cup of cowld
               water to a poor old woman ready to drop on her road?"</p>
            <p>Cathleen instantly pointed forward to the house she had just left, and recommended
               her to apply there. "Sure they're good, honest people, though poor enough, God help
               them," she continued, "and I wish ye mother, no worse luck than myself had, and
               that's a good friend to treat ye to a supper, aye, and a breakfast too; there it is,
               ye may just see the light smoke rising like a thread over the hill, just fornent ye;
               and so God speed ye!"</p>
            <p>Cathleen turned to descend the stile as she spoke expecting to be again seized with a
               strong and murderous grasp; but her enemy, secure in his disguise, <pb n="232"
                  xml:id="image275"/>and never doubting her perfect unconsciousness, suffered her to
               pass unmolested.</p>
            <p>Another half mile brought her to the top of a rising ground, within sight of the high
               road; she could see crowds of people on horseback and on foot, with cars and
               carriages passing along in one direction; for it was, though Cathleen did not then
               know it, the first day of the Cork Assizes. As she gazed, she wished for the wings of
               a bird that she might in a moment flee over the space which intervened between her
               and safety; for though she could clearly see the high road from the hill on which she
               stood, a valley of broken ground at its foot, and two wide fields still separated her
               from it; but with the same unfailing spirit, and at the same steady pace, she
               proceeded onwards: and now she had reached the middle of the last field, and a thrill
               of new born hope was beginning to flutter at her heart, when suddenly two men burst
               through the fence at the farther side of the field, and advanced towards her. One of
               these she thought at the first glance resembled her husband, but that it was her
               husband himself was an idea which never entered her mind. Her imagination was
               possessed with the one supreme idea of danger and death by murderous hands; she
               doubted not that these were the two Hogans in some new disguise, and silently
               recommending herself to God, <pb n="233" xml:id="image276"/>she steeled her heart to
               meet this fresh trial of her fortitude; aware, that however it might end, it
                  <emph>must</emph> be the last. At this moment one of the men throwing up his arms,
               ran forward, shouting her name, in a voice — a dear and well known voice, in which
               she <emph>could</emph> not be deceived: — it was her husband!</p>
            <p>The poor woman, who had hitherto supported her spirits and her self-possession, stood
               as if rooted to the ground, weak, motionless, and gasping for breath. A cold dew
               burst from every pore; her ears tingled, her heart fluttered as though it would burst
               from her bosom. When she attempted to call out, and raise her hand in token of
               recognition, the sounds died away, rattling in her throat; her arm dropped powerless
               at her side; and when her husband came up, and she made a last effort to spring
               towards him, she sank down at his feet in strong convulsions.</p>
            <p>Reilly, much shocked at what he supposed the effect of sudden surprise, knelt down
               and chafed his wife's temples; his comrade ran to a neighbouring spring for water,
               which they sprinkled plentifully over her: when, however, she returned to life, her
               intellects appeared to have fled for ever, and she uttered such wild shrieks and
               exclamations, and talked so incoherently, that the men became exceedingly terrified,
               and poor Reilly himself, almost as distracted as his wife. After vainly attempting to
               soothe and recover her, they at length forcibly carried her <pb n="234"
                  xml:id="image277"/>down to the inn at Balgowna, a hamlet about a mile farther on,
               where she remained for several hours in a state of delirium, one fit succeeding
               another with little intermission.</p>
            <p>Towards evening she became more composed, and was able to give some account of the
               horrible events of the preceding night. It happened, opportunely, that a gentleman of
               fortune in the neighbourhood, and a magistrate, was riding by late that evening on
               his return from the Assizes at Cork, and stopped at the inn to refresh his horse.
               Hearing that something unusual and frightful had occurred, he alighted, and examined
               the woman himself, in the presence of one or two persons. Her tale appeared to him so
               strange and wild from the manner in which she told it, and her account of her own
               courage and sufferings so exceedingly incredible, that he was at first inclined to
               disbelieve the whole, and suspected the poor woman either of imposture or insanity.
               He did not, however, think proper totally to neglect her testimony, but immediately
               sent off information of the murder to Cork. Constables with a warrant were despatched
               [sic] the same night to the house of the Hogans, which they found empty, and the
               inmates already fled: but after a long search, the body of the wretched Halloran, and
               part of his property, were found concealed in a stack of old chimneys among the
               ruins; and this proof of <pb n="235" xml:id="image278"/> guilt was decisive. The
               country was instantly up; the most active search after the murderers was made by the
               police, assisted by all the neighbouring peasantry; and before twelve o'clock the
               following night, the three Hogans, father, mother, and son, had been apprehended in
               different places of concealment, and placed in safe custody. Meantime the Coroner's
               inquest having sat on the body, brought in a verdict of willful murder.</p>
            <p>As the Judges were then at Cork, the trial came on immediately; and from its
               extraordinary circumstances, excited the most intense and general interest. Among the
               property of poor Halloran discovered in the house, were a pair of shoes and a cap
               which Cathleen at once identified as belonging to herself, and Reilly's silver watch
               was found on the younger Hogan. When questioned how they came into his possession, he
               sullenly refused to answer. His mother eagerly, and as if to shield her son confessed
               that she was the person who had robbed Cathleen in the former part of the day, that
               she had gone out on the Carrick road to beg, having been left by her husband and son
               for two days without the means of support; and finding Cathleen asleep, she had taken
               away the bundle, supposing it to contain food; and did not recognise her as the same
               person she had robbed, till Cathleen offered her part of her supper.</p>
            <pb n="236" xml:id="image279"/>
            <p>The surgeon, who had been called to examine the body of Halloran, deposed to the
               cause of his death; — that the old man had been first stunned by a heavy blow on the
               temple, and then strangled. Other witnesses deposed to the finding of the body: the
               previous character of the Hogans, and the circumstances attending their apprehension;
               but the principal witness was Cathleen. She appeared, leaning on her husband, her
               face was ashy pale, and her limbs too weak for support; yet she however, was
               perfectly collected, and gave her testimony with that precision, simplicity, and
               modesty, peculiar to her character. When she had occasion to allude to her own
               feelings, it was with such natural and heart-felt eloquence that the whole court was
               affected; and, when she described her recontre at the stile there was a general
               pressure and a breathless suspense; and then a loud murmur of astonishment and
               admiration fully participated by even the bench of magistrates. The evidence was
               clear and conclusive; and the jury, without retiring, gave their verdict, guilty —
               Death.</p>
            <p>When the miserable wretches were asked, in the usual forms, if they had any thing to
               say why the awful sentence should not be passed upon them, the old man replied by a
               look of idiotic vacancy, and was mute — the younger Hogan answered sullenly,
               "nothing:" the old woman staring wildly on her <pb n="237" xml:id="image280"/>son,
               tried to speak; her lips moved, but without a sound — and she fell forward on the bar
               in strong fits.</p>
            <p>At this moment Cathleen rushed from the arms of her husband, and throwing herself on
               her knees, with clasped hands, and cheeks streaming with tears, begged for mercy for
               the old woman. "Mercy, my lord judge!" she exclaimed. "Gentlemen, your honours, have
               mercy on her. She had mercy on me! She only did their bidding. As for the bundle and
               all in it, I give it to her with all my soul, so it's no robbery. The grip of
               hunger's hard to bear; and if she hadn't taken it then, where would I have been now?
               Sure they would have killed me for the sake of the watch, and I would have been a
               corpse before your honours this moment. O mercy! mercy for her! or never will I sleep
               asy on this side of the grave!"</p>
            <p>The judge, though much affected, was obliged to have her forcibly carried from the
               court, and justice took its awful course. Sentence of death was pronounced on all the
               prisoners; but the woman was reprieved, and afterwards transported. The two men were
               executed within forty-eight hours after their conviction, on the Gallows Green. They
               made no public confession of their guilt, and met their fate with sullen
               indifference. The awful ceremony was for a moment interrupted by an incident with
                  after-<pb n="238" xml:id="image281"/>wards furnished ample matter for wonder and
               speculation among the superstitious populace. It was well known that the younger
               Hogan had been long employed on the estate of a nobleman in the neighbourhood; but
               having been concerned in the abduction of a young female, under circumstances of
               peculiar atrocity, which for the want of legal evidence could not be brought home to
               him, he was dismissed; and, finding himself an object of general execration, he had
               since been skulking about the country, associating with housebreakers and other
               lawless and abandoned characters. At the moment the hangman was adjusting the rope
               round his neck, a shrill voice screamed from the midst of the crowd, "Barny Hogan! do
               ye mind Grace Power, and the last words ever she spoke to ye?" there was a general
               movement and confusion; no one could or would tell whence the voice proceeded. The
               wretched man was seen to change countenance for the first time, and raising himself
               on tiptoe, gazed wildly round upon the multitude: but he said nothing; and in a few
               minutes he was no more.</p>
            <p>The reader may wish to know what has become of Cathleen, our <emph>heroine</emph>, in
               the true sense of the word. Her story, her sufferings, her extraordinary fortitude,
               and pure simplicity of character made her an object of general curiosity and
               interest: a subscription was raised for her, which soon amounted to a liberal sum;
               they were enabled to procure Reilly's discharge from <pb n="239" xml:id="image282"
               />the army, and with a part of the money, Cathleen, who, among her other perfections,
               was exceedingly pious after the fashion of her creed and country, founded yearly
               masses for the soul of the poor Pedlar; and vowed herself to make a pilgrimage of
               thanksgiving to St. Gobnate's well. Mr. L. the magistrate who had first examined her
               in the little inn at Balgowna, made her a munificent present; and anxious, perhaps,
               to offer yet farther amends for his former doubts of her veracity, he invited Reilly
               on very advantageous terms, to settle on his estate, where he rented a neat cabin,
               and a <emph>handsome</emph> plot of potatoe ground. There Reilly and his Cathleen
               were living ten years ago, with an increasing family, and in the enjoyment of much
               humble happiness; and there, for aught I know to the contrary, they may be living at
               this day.</p>

            <p>"There is no faith in woman!" I exclaimed to myself the other morning, and I repeated
               it thrice with increasing emphasis.</p>
            <p>"There is no faith in woman. — And what woman has taught you to think so?" said a
               soft voice near me.</p>
            <p>I started, for I had most unconsciously been uttering my thoughts aloud, while
               leaning on the back of my cousin Agatha's couch, with my eyes resting on the sheet of
               music paper which lay before her. I coloured as her glance met mine.</p>
            <p>"Nay — is it not true?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Nay," she repeated — "I will not be answered by a nay! — cousin Henry."</p>
            <p>"But my dear cousin — my dear Agatha" — cried I, "you are a woman, and a beautiful
               woman — you can be no judge."</p>
            <pb n="243" xml:id="image298"/>
            <p>"And supposing I admit it," said Agatha, smiling, "what has my beauty to do with
               either my womanhood, or my judgment?"</p>
            <p>"There you may answer it yourself — what woman can judge of her sex's failings! —
               what beautiful woman can deal fairly by a sister beauty?"</p>
            <p>"Is this all?" replied she, "Then you have learned to libel us merely from the cant
               of the day!"</p>
            <p>"It is the cant of ages," said I.</p>
            <p>"Surely not! — the cant of the careless and the unmeaning — but not where there is a
               heart and head to think, and to feel — no, my dear cousin, do not repeat it. There is
               both trust and truth in woman."</p>
            <p>"Agatha," said I, "why have you never married?"</p>
            <p>"Harry," returned she, "why have you this ill opinion of our sex?"</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! But with your beauty, and your wit, and your fortune and consequence" — </p>
            <p>"Tell me — why do you quarrel with us?" — "Harry," continued my cousin, interrupting
               me with more earnestness, "we must not let our own individual disappointments disgust
               us with the world at large — search well, and we shall discover our injustice —
               besides, let us be content though we meet but one faithful heart amidst a crowd of
               treachery."</p>
            <p>"And how shall we find it? Where shall we meet with this faithful heart in woman? No,
               Agatha," <pb n="244" xml:id="image299"/>cried I, "you mistake the character of woman
               — you do not know her — you cannot know her — you, who must always be every way above
               the rest of your sex, and as different as inimitable!"</p>
            <p>She was silent, she was even grave for a moment or two, and the shade of thought in
               the expression of her bland and beautiful countenance seemed almost as if it grew
               into sadness. She looked at me with a smile, "Cousin," said she, "tell me your
               history? You have been unfortunate;" and she pointed with her small and snow white
               hand to the vacant seat beside her on the sofa.</p>
            <p>There was a gentleness, a delicacy, and a tenderness in my cousin Agatha's
               disposition which gave a charm to her slightest action. It was a gracefulness of
               character which seemed to have inspired the gracefulness of her person and her every
               motion, her tone of feeling, both in gaiety and sorrow, irresistible. I seated myself
               beside her on the sofa, and did as she had bid me. "I have been in love," said I, "it
               is my whole history."</p>
            <p>"And what then?" she enquired, "was your mistress unfaithful?"</p>
            <p>"I have told you all in one word — woman and infidelity go together!" I paused for
               some minutes, and when I spoke again I had obtained more self-possession.</p>
            <pb n="245" xml:id="image300"/>
            <p>"When I first went abroad," said I, "I spent some time at Florence. The fashionable
               lounge was the picture-gallery, and there was I a daily visitor but I went thither
               really to gratify my passion for paintings, and not to gaze, and be gazed at by the
               company. One morning while I was standing as usual before my favorite study, I was
               startled by some one tapping me lightly on the shoulder, I suddenly turned round — it
               was a lady, and one of the most beautiful of earth's creatures; but her look and
               attitude were even more striking than her countenance and figure. She was, in a
               manner, stealing a glance into my face, with such a curiosity, and interest, and
               earnestness, blended with such a fanciful coquetry and intelligence in her expression
               as amazed me. She enjoyed my surprise and admiration for about half a second, and
               then with the most natural negligence in the world, pointed gracefully with the hand
               which still rested on my arm, to the ground. It was her handkerchief that had fallen
               at my feet, and I instantly stooped, and raised it. She stretched out her hand to
               receive it, before I had even time to present it to her, nodded her head half with
               the air of a pleased child, half with the air of a woman of fashion, and then folding
               her arms in her drapery round her, resumed her contemplation of the painting before
               us, which this little accident seemed to have disturbed. I stood with my eyes
               fastened on <pb n="246" xml:id="image301"/>her, wondering who this enthralling
               creature could be. She had that decided air of fashion which there is no mistaking,
               and a certain air much superior to it; but there was a something so whimsical in her
               style of dress, and in her style of appearance altogether, to make me feel uncertain
               what to think of her.</p>
            <p>"Just as I was looking round to enquire her name of some bystander, she turned and
               addressed me; I forget now what it was she said to me, something about my favourite
               painting, or my general fondness for pictures; whatever it might be, I was so much a
               novice in fashion as to feel uncomfortable at her speaking to me. I remember,
               however, that though her words were select, her manner struck me as common-place;
               she, moreover, seemed to me a coquette, and I immediately concluded that she must be
               marked by all the silliness of her class. In appearance she might have been about two
               or three and twenty, but I suspect she was more, perhaps from my own inexperience,
               for she struck me as being used to the ways of the world. It was evident that she was
               aware of the admiration which she had elicited, that she had expected it, and was
               therefore pleased with it, and meant to excite a little more. No one but a boy,
               probably no one but such a boy as I, would have been seized with these reflexions at
               the moment that she was soliciting my attention; but very young men, and young men
                  <pb n="247" xml:id="image302"/>unaccustomed to general society, are naturally more
               alive to what is real and what is affected in character than those of older and
               better acquaintance with life, but whose very acquaintance has served to trammel them
               into its manoeuvres and intricacies.</p>
            <p>"She turned away after some minutes, and joined her party a few paces off. My eye
               followed them as they moved up the gallery; she shone always conspicuous among the
               throng of gentlemen who gathered as she went, around her, in clustering numbers;
               while now pausing for a second in a picturesque attitude to examine a painting — now
               breaking on my ear in tones of exaggerated feeling either of horror or of extasy —
               now partaking with faint effort in the casual vivacity of her attending bevy, or
               leading with startling violence a sudden laugh. I believe I had just then a rage for
               simplicity, for even her charms disgusted me. She was an Englishwoman too, and I had
               just been commenting, perhaps, with ungrateful sarcasm, on the freedom of Florentine
               manners. At the upper end of the gallery I lost sight of her, and when I looked
               around me I found that the crowd had followed her — there was not a creature near
               me.</p>
            <p>"Do you not know her?" said some one whom I had approached on purpose to question.
               "It is the honourable Mrs. Beaufilliers, the celebrated Mrs. Beaufilliers, she was
               the greatest beauty of the day <pb n="248" xml:id="image303"/>or of any day, and she
               never comes here without making a sensation; by the way, she means to have you in her
               train I fancy, for I saw her cast her eyes on you the moment she entered the
               room."</p>
            <p>"It is incredible how even the turn of a phrase can affect us. These few last words
               had realized all my own thoughts with regard to Mrs. Beauvilliers.</p>
            <p>"What then," said I, "she's a coquette?"</p>
            <p>"By no means," cried the other, "only a little addicted to Platonic love and
               fashionable admirers. She has us all fast here, we all wear her colours. Though,
                  <emph>par parenthese</emph>, I thought her a little gone by this morning, these
               beauties never know when to give up, unless we give them up."</p>
            <p>"Come," said he, "I'll introduce you."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," answered I, "I know her perfectly already."</p>
            <p>"I saw Mrs. Beauvilliers again, it was at a ball that very evening. She had just
               withdrawn a little out of the circle of waltzers, and was leaning against a pillar
               changing her white satin slippers. One gentleman stood beside her busied in receiving
               the discarded pair; another proffered the fresh ones; and the third, her fortunate
               partner, with one knee on the ground, supported her delicate feet by turns on the
               other and fastened the sandals.</p>
            <p>"How old is she?" asked I, "for I felt quite a curiosity to discover."</p>
            <pb n="249" xml:id="image304"/>
            <p>"Lord," answered the person next me, "I have known her culling hearts these fifty
               years!"</p>
            <p>'She could not be fifty, though she had certainly worn better than any person I know;
               even when near I could not have supposed her past thirty.</p>
            <p>"I can scarcely say how much I dislike this description of character. It revolted
               against all my nations of feminine propriety; that sensitive dignity of woman's
               peculiar nature! It offended all my most respectable feelings towards the sex, and I
               remember I stood aloof during the evening from Mrs. Beauvilliers, boyishly abashed at
               her frivolous familiarity of manners. I left Florence soon after, but I carried some
               of her impressions along with me. She spoiled me for the next twelvemonth. I had
               never before been vain of my personal qualifications, but it was not easy to forget
               that they had not been absolutely unattractive. This was all that dwelt with me, and
               some years of after life passed on the continent, though they may have habituated me
               to the looseness of its decorum, have never destroyed my esteem for all that is
               beautiful in purity!"</p>
            <p>I stopped for I felt that I was considerably agitated and my silence was of some
               duration.</p>
            <p>"You will proceed Harry?" said my cousin gently, "for your story is both interesting
               and instructive."</p>
            <p>"Yes," answered I, "but it is somewhat diffi-<pb n="250" xml:id="image305"/>cult!"
               and I still hesitated. "You should have seen her," I exclaimed at length, abruptly.
               "You should have known her, though she was scarcely handsome — I will only half name
               her to you, Agatha, as I have named her to herself in the last days of our
               acquaintance — Gabriella."</p>
            <p>"It is just about three years since we first met; I remember it well, for even then
               it was to me a circumstance of importance. I was introduced to her in a private
               concert room just as her carriage was announced — she had been standing near the
               doorway, and I was the last person she bowed to as she left the room. I remember it
               was near the end of the season. She was the fashion in London, but I had never
               admired her. I had heard her talked of as beautiful, but I had never thought her so.
               She was striking, but it was an air of fashion more than either beauty or grace in
               her appearance. I liked her reception of me; I had always allowed her to be a fine
               woman, and I found something extremely agreeable in her countenance when she spoke,
               and extreme good nature in her general manner. She rather interested me than
               otherwise, though she had only just stayed to receive my bow, and observe to me "that
               she was going," as she went out.</p>
            <p>"She had quitted town for the country before I could see her again, and not long
               after I followed her thither. I forget now who it was that invited me; I <pb n="251"
                  xml:id="image306"/>think it was some connexion of the family, whose employment was
               to furnish the table with guests, and the guests with society. Gabriella's husband
               was of a rude description of men; he was seldom to be seen in the house but at
               dinner, and at dinner he liked to have plenty of people to talk to, and to listen to
               him. If his cold be called society, at table they had his society, but otherwise
               these general chance kind of guests were but little attended to. I should scarcely
               have availed myself, however, of this manner of admittance to hospitality, had I not
               been rather forced into calling on them on my accidentally meeting some of the party
               in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>"Agatha," cried I, "I scarcely know why I repeat these details, for it is uneasy for
               me to recal the memory of our first acquaintance!</p>
            <p>"If you had known her you would have pardoned the madness of my love — had you known
               Gabriella you would have wept for the cruelty of her caprice! Her spirit of coquetry
               was indeed untamed, untameable. She pursued me her victim with unwearied skill; flung
               with captivating ingenuity her whole heart into his service; wound her graceful toils
               around his existence, and urged on with irresistible persuasion the tortures of that
               grief which she contemplated with remorseless and insatiable ambition. How I tried to
               leave her, how I tried to escape from the influence of her fascinations, it seems of
               little pur-<pb n="252" xml:id="image307"/>pose now to tell. I did <emph>not</emph>
               leave her, and Gabriella's smiles returned. She could weep too, and at times I have
               seen a starting tear bedew her cheek. But why should I instruct you in all the arts
               and all the expedients of her most reprehensible coquetry; it was as restless as
               extravagant. She had probably never loved her husband, and esteem was what she could
               bestow on none. She was incapable of friendship; her heart had been framed to
               sentiment, she had no steadiness in her nature to persevere in her affections. Her
               husband was little calculated to excite either, and to Gabriella he was peculiarly
               unsuited. They seldom met, but no appearance of unharmony subsisted between them. I
               have known her consult him on a matter of duty, and him leave to her the choice of
               the inscriptions on his dog-collars. He never interfered with her, but he was
               sometimes glad to have her look well when she sat at the head of his table.</p>
            <p>"Her appearance had never been the lure which attracted me; and her appearance was
               then, in my opinion, by much her least qualification. Yet she possessed a large share
               of the essentials which constitute beauty: her outline of feature was good, and her
               complexion must once have been brilliant. At times it was still beautiful, for
               Gabriella was no longer quite what is called a very young woman when I knew her.</p>
            <pb n="253" xml:id="image308"/>
            <p>"She had the address to turn this want of admiration to her person on my part, into
               her most absolute attraction. Her charm consisted in her undeviating amiability of
               manner; in her apparent forbearance of disposition; in her constant propriety of
               temper; in her implicit obedience to the caprices of her admirer, and her seeming
               readiness of obedience to any exertion of authority, from the man whom she had
               received as a husband. I love to dwell on this part of her character; I would cling
               to the thought that she might once have deserved better; that she was not all that
               she appeared to me when we last met and parted — a heartless, practiced, unblushing
               and unprincipled coquette!</p>
            <p>"We have periods of feeling when it requires but a little to pen our eyes to the real
               disposition of matters carried on around us; and once awakened, it is astonishing how
               quickly we grow in wisdom. It must be always impossible in these after moments to
               trace the many, various, almost imperceptible accidents that may have occurred to
               bring us acquainted with the delusions practiced on us — perhaps which we have
               ourselves too readily indulged. To you, it will be difficult to comprehend from how
               slight a circumstance my impressions of Gabriella's character were first startled
               into a more sober reflexion on her behaviour.</p>
            <p>"I had been staggered by a sentiment, and it seemed to me a profligate sentiment. We
               were talking on the freedom of Italian manners, more especially that of the women,
               and she was expatiating on them with considerable eagerness. I remember she used the
               words, "the <emph>luxury</emph> of their independence, their perfect want of all
               control, all form — odious form!" And she threw her eyes up to Heaven as she spoke.
               She had beautiful eyes, but this time their appeal <pb n="254" xml:id="image309"
               />seemed to me out of place. She threw them on <emph>me</emph>, but they did not move
               me, and she yielded her opinion as she always did, only with less hesitation than was
               usual with her, for me to be as usual satisfied with my victory. I was peculiarly
               sensitive on this one point — the delicacy of a woman's deportment; and Gabriella's
                  <emph>manner</emph> had sometimes disturbed me. I had sometimes wondered at her
               self-possession too, only that to me she was never self-possessed. She had often
               turned off an uncomfortable sentence with a gay laugh, which has covered me with
               confusion and offence, and I have felt that I should yet have been more at ease had
               she been less so.</p>
            <p>"I was silent for some time after, and thoughtful, and Gabriella tried to woo me into
               better company. She was seldom unsuccessful, and insensibly we grew into conversation
               again. One or two of the rest of the company joined us, and we gathered into a little
               circle round her sofa.</p>
            <pb n="255" xml:id="image310"/>
            <p>"The discourse turned on manners, but this time it was on English manners. A
               gentleman present, and who, by the way, was rather a celebrated traveler, just
               rising, or risen into fame and fashion, observed that in no country in the world did
               there exist such perfect domestic and conjugal happiness as in England — such an
               entire confidence between husband and wife — such a perfect union both of heart and
               mind — </p>
            <p>"Gabriella assented cordially, and applauded the feeling with warmth. I had turned
               away, and when I looked again I found that her eyes were bent on the traveler.</p>
            <p>"Where — in what other country," pursued he, "do we find such an agreeable social
               intercourse to prevail between an man and his wife. Even in the highest walks of life
               there is visible such an exquisite and charming familiarity. To take a fanciful view
               of the subject, for instance, that one little circumstance of calling each other by
               the mere Christian name abbreviated, as we hear it too, in every possible way, by
               people of the first fashion, speaks volumes."</p>
            <p>"Poor Mama!" exclaimed Gabriella, "I remember Mama always called poor Papa,
               Beau!"</p>
            <p>"Who was your mother?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Heavens!" cried she, "Don't you know? The beautiful Mrs. Beauvilliers. 'La bella
               bellissima,' <pb n="256" xml:id="image311"/>as she was called in Italy! I was in
               mourning for her when I first saw <emph>you</emph>. Have you never seen the beautiful
               miniature of Mama in my room?"</p>
            <p>"I have seen the original," answered I, "in the picture gallery at Florence."</p>
            <p>"Whether it was the tone of my voice, for I felt that it was altered, or the
               expression of my countenance, for I was crimsoned to the temples, that struck
               Gabriella, I know not — but she changed the conversation. For my part I had relapsed
               into my silence, and I slunk away. Gabriella the daughter of Mrs. Beauvilliers!</p>
            <p>"Why have you never told me that you had been at Florence?" said she next morning
               when we were alone. "How odd! We must have been there together, and we were
               strangers!"</p>
            <p>"I knew your mother," said I.</p>
            <p>"Poor Mama! Heavens! How beautiful she must have been. But did you absolutely know
               her. I thought I had known the whole circle of Mama's admirers."</p>
            <p>"But why need I go on. It was, perhaps, fortunate for me that I could never separate
               the connexion between Mrs. Beauvilliers and Gabriella. The early impression of her
               mother which had been left so strongly on my mind, could not be effaced by any
               recurrence to the daughter. I could never think on Gabriella without recalling to my
               recollection Mrs. <pb n="257" xml:id="image312"/>Beauvilliers in the picture gallery,
               or in the ballroom at Florence. However disguised might be their manner, their
               conduct was too similar to bear comparison. From the suddenness with which the veil
               of my illusion fell from before my eyes almost from that very hour it would seem now
               as if I had been influenced by prejudice. But no, it was Gabriella's self that cast
               it from me. True, my knowledge of her mother's character had given me an insight into
               the character of the daughter. It had made me think, and thought was destruction to
               Gabriella. Her behaviour could not bear investigation — her character still less so.
               It was not the shock of Mrs. Beauvilliers as a mother that had disturbed me, it was
               the dread of Mrs. Beauvilliers as a model for too apt a representation; and what as
               the folly of a foolish woman would have passed without other reproach, grew criminal
               in the more gifted intellect of her daughter.</p>
            <p>"Gabriella's defence was powerless. The dream which had wrapped my senses gave way
               gradually but quickly, as the imperfect light that had first dawned on me broke into
               open day. Her struggles to retain her victim became only the more reprehensible, her
               real grief at his escape only the greater earnest of the selfish, frivolous vanity
               which had induced his capture. Her powers of complete self-interest and indifference
               to all beside were indeed <pb n="258" xml:id="image313"/>wonderful! With a voice, a
               look, a gesture, still pleading with well feigned motive for delay, she turned
               without a moment lost to lament her failure, from the resolute departure of the one
               lover, to play with unabated assiduity the same game over again with another.</p>
            <p>"My last glimpse of her, as my chaise rolled rapidly away, showed her turning from
               the entrance door into the little walk that leads to her flower-garden, leaning on
               the arm of the traveller.</p>
            <p>"But to the end, mistress of her art, she has left me without a doubt of her
               unworthiness still to regret in bitter hopelessness the peace of mind that she has
               broken for ever."</p>
            <p>I rose as I concluded, and walked to the window, for it was a moment of weakness over
               which I had no control. But the effort was not sufficient, and I buried my face in my
               hands.</p>
            <p>I was roused by my cousin's gentle voice, and she laid her soft white hand upon my
               arm. "Harry," said she, "if I may trust this moment's sorrow, your peace of mind — it
               is not broken for ever."</p>
            <p>"Agatha," said I, "it is not to such as you that I should betray the secrets of a
               weak and miserable passion. It is not with such as you that I should contemplate the
               frailties of an erring sex; but I cannot forget that such a fair creation has been
               created to so little good."</p>
            <pb n="259" xml:id="image314"/>
            <p>"I regret it with you — but I have seen Gabriella," she continued, "I have known her
               — she was unworthy of you — yet her troth was plighted to another, she could break
               none with you."</p>
            <p>"Good God! What other!"</p>
            <p>"And do you then," said Agatha, gravely, "think so lightly of the duties of a wife.
               Believe me it is the highest station which the heart, or the ambition of woman should
               aspire to. She is charged with the dearest interests of one more responsible in life
               than herself — his most tender dignity is confided to her care, and if she break her
               trust, if she be wanting but in the smallest portion of this silent bond, she
               violates the most solemn engagement of her life, and is forsworn before God and man
               in the vows which she has taken upon her in the presence of both?" She stopped, and
               coloured at her own eloquence. "Harry," said she, "What do you regret? your peace of
               mind? Let it return to you — let not the caprices of an ill-guided woman weigh upon
               you. There are some thanks due for the return to a duty from which you should never
               have wandered."</p>
            <p>"I am grateful," said I, "as grateful as I can be. I feel that it is beneath me to
               dwell thus on the memory of such a woman. But when you have loved, Agatha, you will
               forgive a weakness, which, like an early deep-rooted disease, still continues to
               sting me with poignancy, in utter defiance of the leech's <pb n="260"
                  xml:id="image315"/>utmost skill. Oh, Agatha — dear Agatha — you have never — never
               loved — "</p>
            <p>The expression of her countenance caught my attention just then, but she was
               silent.</p>
            <p>"Have you ever loved," cried I, forgetting at the moment all else but what was
               belonging to my cousin Agatha. She smiled, but her smile was followed by a sigh.</p>
            <p>A strange feeling came over me, and I caught her hand. I scarcely know what I said,
               but it was not of Gabriella that I spoke or thought. There was a slight flutter
               visible in her countenance when I began, but she listened to me with mildness; then
               with a gentle shake of her head she extricated her hand, and glided from the
               window.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WE once — (it is now some years ago) — enjoyed the pleasure of meeting the celebrated
                  "<emph>Beau Leverton</emph>." As every thing which relates to him "belongs" — as
               writers say, "to history," we shall indulge ourselves with putting our recollections
               upon record. We respect a beau of the first brilliancy; and wonder at his appearance,
               as at that of an aloe. He is perhaps even a rarer marvel.</p>
            <p>Here, however, let us caution the reader. We would not be understood as paying
               implicit homage to the stuffed figures which move in procession down Bond and St.
               James's Streets, kept upright solely by the aid of staymakers and tailors. On the
               contrary, we hold them to be of precisely the same advantage in a commonwealth, that
               those less ostentatious shapes are which keep watch in country gardens, as perpetual,
               centinels over the peas and currants. But Leverton was not one of this small-witted
               genus. He was originally intended for something even higher than what he became. Fate
               however threw him into <pb n="262" xml:id="image317"/>the sty of Circe, and he grew
               like bottom, 'transformed.' — Nevertheless, let us still do him justice. He was a man
               of a shrewd turn of mind; too idle to emancipate himself from the thrall of fashion,
               but laughing down with ineffable contempt the pretensions of the small fry around
               him. He saw far into character, and sometimes made it subservient to his purposes. He
               had flashes (scintillations) of wit, which brightened and became more frequent in
               melancholy hours, as the electric fluid is seen more clearly in a storm. He told a
               story well, — laughed in the right place, — drew out the follies of his neighbours
               with a fine, humorous, and sometimes unsparing, hand, — had a smattering of the
               classics, and the lighter literature of England and France, — made champagne tea
               delightfully, and scattered his multitudes of bon mots upon the crowd, as a peasant
               does his arms-full of grapes and chestnuts upon the swine who are expecting them
               beneath. Unluckily, Leverton's audiences in general did not comprehend a little of
               the value of his donations. They laughed, however, at his jests, because it was the
               fashion to laugh at them; and they related them to others, from time to time, in the
               hope of, one day or other, discovering the meaning themselves.</p>
            <p>When Leverton left Oxford, and threw himself upon the inattention of his father, he
               found the foxhunter so entirely perplexed by his rural duties, that he had not a
               moment of leisure to notice his <pb n="263" xml:id="image318"/>heir. Harry was a
               youth of spirit, and not insensible to neglect: So he determined to live as he could
               during his father's life, on the small income which had devolved upon him on the
               death of his mother. His proposal to this effect met with not the slightest objection
               from Old Nimrod: and accordingly, (after seeing his sister safe under the protection
               of an old maiden aunt at Bath), Leverton quitted without a sigh, his paternal acres;
               quoted his last line of Horace at the cunning-eyed groom, who lashed his portmanteau
               to the chaise, and came up to London, 'to make his — reputation!'</p>
            <p>His success was eminent, but gradual; for he did not aim so much at eccentricity
               (which is a cheap accomplishment) as at an air of high-breeding and careless
               brilliancy. He possessed extreme ease, and considerable with; and the pungency of the
               one quality had an admirable effect upon the other, as salt is said to draw forth an
               exquisite flavor from things which would else be tasteless. One joke, which he threw
               off in a happy moment, attracted the respect of a smart speaker in the House of
               Commons. Another (which was better) reached the ear of an illustrious personage, who
               said that it reminded him of George Selwyn. He enquired very particularly the name of
               the author, and the fame of our hero was complete!</p>
            <p>We have not leisure at present to enter into a <pb n="264" xml:id="image319"/>regular
               biographical detail of the early life of Mr. Leverton, although (by the favor of a
               friend) we are possessed of considerable materials for the purpose. But we must
               content ourselves with passing over many of the accidents and humours of his career,
               and introducing him to the reader as he appeared to us, <emph>in propria
                  persona</emph>, on the third day of July, 18 — .</p>
            <p>At that time he had lodgings in Dover-street, and as eminent a list of creditors and
               friends, 'of the first water,' as any gentleman who ever disowned the serious age of
               three and forty. In regard to his person, he had increased somewhat in bulk, though
               it was said that stays, or some such unseen bonds, curtailed the encroachments of
               idleness or gourmanderie. Yet, he still walked well; dressed inimitably; lost his
               money (when he had it) gracefully; drawled out his sly witticisms with considerable
               effect; and was in all respects a 'highly fashionable man.'</p>
            <p>Leverton's importance in society was, in fact, exceedingly great; more so than his
               mere talent could have commanded. His ease was admired — his manners and his dress
               imitated — his flattery coveted — his patronage wooed. His satire was dreaded also;
               for he possessed (as the bee does) both the honey and the sting, — the wish sometimes
               to charm, and always the spirit to repel. The gay loved his jokes; the young sought
               his intimacy; the women smiled on him; the (merely) rich dreaded him; and the <pb
                  n="265" xml:id="image320"/>wit admitted him to his level. Even the dignity of
               birth relaxed from it superciliousness; and wise men rejoiced that for once they
               might indulge their laughter, without any impeachment of their understanding.</p>
            <p>This is a formidable estimate to do justice to; and indeed, we are not able to do it
               justice. For we have stated the <emph>aggregate</emph> of our hero's accomplishments;
               whereas few of them appeared in any one single conversation. He was contented, often,
               with very slight indications of his power; and, he sometimes, even betrayed scarcely
               a glimpse of his really original character.</p>
            <p>We once met him, as we have said. This was at Lord Trumpington's seat in Sussex, in
               18 — ; and the following letter, from the Beau himself, to one of his intimates,
               (which has been entrusted to us) will afford some explanation as to the company who
               figure in the dialogue which occurred there. It is written in a vast running hand,
               extending over three sheets of paper and is addressed</p>
            <p>"To Thomas Blair MacDonald, Esq. at Long's Hotel, London."</p>
            <p>"I cannot — I grieve to say it — be trans-atlantic with ye to-morrow evening, Tom.
               You must smoke your cigars of peace without me. Do not, however, affront thyself and
               thy brother Sachems, at my apparent desertion; but bury your tomahawks in <pb n="266"
                  xml:id="image321"/>the venison quietly, and forget so poor a man as Harry
               Leverton.</p>
            <p>"Shall I tell thee what ahs kept me thus amongst green corn and withered oak apples?
               Shall I, turning philosophical, betray to thee how the loadstone — I have half a mind
               to commit violence upon the three virgin sheets of paper which lie sleeping beside
               me, and inscribe my adventures upon them, for thine especial benefit. It
                  <emph>shall</emph> be thus: so listen!</p>
            <p>I was satisfied, as thou know'st, with London; although the dog-star reigned,
               although the face of every (surviving) friend was baked, the ice-cellars empty, and
               the month of July at hand. But my Lord Bridewell <emph>would</emph> be at once
               peremptory and persuasive; and I had, I must confess to thee, reasons for not
               despising his suit. He came to my domicile, as he threatened, on Tuesday last; armed
               with spurs, and attended by tow gardes du corps, a traveling chariot and coach, four
               postillions, and the warrant (to which was the sign manual) of Lady Cecil Dartley, to
               take the body of Henry Leverton, and him convey, etc. to her ladyship's court, which
               is at present held at the Grange, in Sussex.</p>
            <p>"I will spare thee the tediousness of our journey. It is enough to tell thee, that we
               survived almost fifty miles of English dust — passed in triumph over four pigs, who
               made outrageous protestations against our proceedings — 'took' (as my lord called it)
               a <pb n="267" xml:id="image322"/>post — missed children of all ages (one a succulent)
               — refreshed at F — , and arrived without further mischief or matter at "The Grange."
               The place is pretty enough: a little hill — a lawn — a shrubbery — a fish-pond or two
               (they have capital stewed carp) and a modern sort of antique cottage-villa, where
               Vitruvius and Palladio, Greek, Goth, and Sir John Vanbrugh, flourish in united
               absurdity. This is all well. But the utter demolition of my toilette-equipage is a
               calamity for life: for some of the trifles were unique — and Burgess (my chamberlain)
               has been unable to procure anything beyond the most alarming instruments at — I
               forget its horrid name — the nearest market town. You know that I indulge in some
               little niceties on these points. What wouldst thou think of my undergoing a course of
               brushes and shears of as rude a — Bah! I sent the former into the stable without
               delay, and reserve the latter for sheep-shearing, whenever I shall arrive at my aunt
               Slatter's pastures in Devon, which a villainous asthma (that provokes longevity) has
               kept me out of for the last twenty and five years!</p>
            <p>"Well, Tom, — The earl bowed, and looked grim and wise, and mumbled out his patrician
               welcomes, (which were too ceremonious by half). The old countess, who paints as thick
               as a door, laboured to be alluring, and Lady Cecil out-looked all the roses which
               went scrambling about the drawing-room <pb n="268" xml:id="image323"/>windows.
               Bridewell was busy in the stable, and left me to make my way with his family as well
               as I could. And, in truth, bashfulness is not my vice, as thou knowest, Tom.
               Accordingly, after a brief refuge in my dressing-room, I descended, and found a mob
               of indifferent appearance, all prepared to invade the regions where eating and
               drinking are honoured. Some of our friends (is not that the word, Tom?) were there,
               male and female, coupled together like pigeons. One fair hand was, however, reserved
               for me (by the grace of the countess mother) — and it was that of the blooming
               Cecil!</p>
            <p>"But I see that thou art dying to know who are my agreeable cotemporaries; — and I
               will tell thee.</p>
            <p>"In the first place, then, behold our 'noble' family: — The earl, as dull as a drum,
               and tedious beyond even the privilege of parliament; the countess, a fine old enamel,
               as I have said, but a little cracked, and somewhat out of drawing: Cecil Dartley,
               always couleur de rose; and her sister Selina, a languid plant; their brother
               (Bridewell) the son and heir of all the Trumpingtons; and Colonel Dartley, a brother
               also according to law, but, in other respects, a thing between pug and monkey, that
               is hung round with blue and scarlet, and dances through 'the Lancers,' or to the tune
               of 'Money in both Pockets,' till Fanny Dartley is ready to die with admiration. <pb
                  n="269" xml:id="image324"/>Then cometh Fanny herself, a cousin of the family; who,
               a la Ture, staineth her fingers inch deep (with ink), and is a true specimen of that
               little female indiscretion, and authoress. Thou wouldst expire, my good friend Tom,
               if thou couldst behold her in her morning garments — they are so flowing, so
               oriental, so scornful of all shape and fashion, and withal, so utterly covered with
               dusky hieroglyphics, that one can scarcely distinguish between the sweep of her
               stylus and the broader impress of her thumb. All is in learned confusion, like a
               country library; but incomparably less cleanly. Yet, 'tis a good-natured chit, and
               laughs and talks, (O Gad! Tom,) and invites the women to drink wine; and argues like
               a syllogism; and is very odd, — and a little tedious. Next to her, was a Sir Somebody
               Something, the county member, and his lady, trussed and tucked up like a Christmas
               turkey, of the county also, and indigenous; their son, a spare thing, of six feet
               high, whose person hath outrun his wit; while by his side sate, full of scorn and
               languor, the Lady Selina Dartley. Then came Snapwell, the barrister; one of the young
               Froths, a pretty thing, but as insipid as plain broth; old Moidore, the Ministerial
               merchant, and (an inexpressible person!) his wife; descended from the tribe of Levi,
               — but converted. Then followed a Squire Huggins, or Higgins, a proprietor of acres in
               these parts; then another Froth, not so pretty as the last, but with an exquisite
               propriety of shape; then <pb n="270" xml:id="image325"/>Lord Saint Stephens, the new
               orator; and an odious fellow from the most northern part of the north, a Mr. John Mac
               Flip, an author, a critic, and a reporter, and a politician to boot; possessing
               little, however, that need be mentioned beyond an incredible portion of assurance,
               and an appetite that surmounts all fable. By him (well matched) sate a little black
               female barbarian from Shetland, or the Orkneys; then came a 'Mac' of some endless
               descent; then that immoderate simpleton Garnish, — Lady Di. Flarish, and her
               detestable sister, — and finally, young Gabbleton, from Oxford who has travelled in
               Greece, and what is worse, hath written his travels, and still talketh his travels,
               till the fish (which he helpeth) is cold. These are nearly all, except our 'ancient'
               Childers, the foxhunter — Jack Sitwell, (Bridewell's Newmarket chum,) — a physician,
               and a Lord of the Admiralty, a burgess or two from the neighbouring Borough, and a
               rubicund figure, somewhat like a pipe of wine, (called the Vicar of the village,)
               which tolls out grace before dinner as regularly as the clock, (but louder) —
               i'faith, and after dinner also, I believe, unless he chance to go to sleep over the
               entremets.</p>
            <p>"And now, farewell, Tom. If thou art but half as fatigued in reading this as I in
               writing, (and I am not without hopes but that thou <emph>wilt</emph> be,) thou wilt
               bid me henceforward discontinue sending thee any more of the adventures of thy most
               faithful</p>
            <p> HARRY LEVERTON."</p>
            <pb n="271" xml:id="image326"/>
            <p> — Amongst the company, who were too unimportant for mention in Mr. Leverton's
               letter, were ourselves (ourself) and a few others, with whose names we need not
               trouble the reader. We will merely conduct him to the dinner room, and let him take
               his chance for relishing or disliking the fare.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Every thing which opulence could purchase, or ostentation suggest, was spread upon
               the patrician board of the Earl of Trumpington. He had hammered his brains for a
               month: he had read Ude, and Rundell, and Beauvilliers, and dipped into the
               eccentricities of Kitchiner, in order to arrive at correct opinions. He had been
               closeted with his French cook; he had modelled and re-modelled, altered, doubted,
               suggested, and tormented the impatience of his housekeeper with endless
               consultations. They quarrelled, however, at last, over the shape of a custard
               pudding, and Mrs. Dripwell was restored to her original quiet.</p>
            <p>The result of all this thought and labour was now before the guests. Venison, and
               soups, and fish, of every sort which the season justified, were there; innumerable
               hues. From plain beef and mountain mutton, up to the mysterious compositions of the
               French artists, no more to be developed than the riddles of the Sphinx, every thing
               was there that the most accomplished epicurean could wish for. One <pb n="272"
                  xml:id="image327"/>thing alone was remarkable — namely, the many dishes which bore
               the names of some regal or noble family. There were sauce royale, cotelets de Bourbon
               and de Maintenon, Pates de Perigord, and — fifty others. For the Earl was such a
               stickler for dignity, that he could not bear to be mistaken for a commoner, even in
               his dishes.</p>
            <p>Dr. Grampus ('the Viar') mumbled out a brief grace, and the company sate down to
               table. For a short space all other sounds were lost in the rustling of silks, and the
               adjustment of table napkins. To these succeeded the clatter of china, the occasional
               jarring of silver, the quick tread of the servants to and fro, and such like
               indications of a dinner party. At last Mr. Gabbleton broke silence.</p>
            <p>"Will not your Ladyship take soup?" enquired he, of Lady Di. Who sate opposite to
               him? "nor fish? — what <emph>can</emph> I send you?"</p>
            <p>"Nothing," replied the lady. "I shall wait for the removal of these trifles. I have
               ordered a beef-steak."</p>
            <p>The Earl (between whom and the lady certain hostilities existed,) blushed crimson at
               hearing of this "free and easy" proceeding on her part; while Leverton, after staring
               a moment at her masculine appearance, proceeded to finish his white soup.</p>
            <p>"Beef-steak! — I honour your ladyship's taste;" said Garnish, who could bear to hold
               his tongue no <pb n="273" xml:id="image328"/>longer. "I give you my word that I
               generally dine on a beef-steak myself, when at home — I may say generally. Ah, ha!"
               continued he, "after all, there's noting like eating and drinking . Don't you think
               so, Leverton? By the way, Leverton, what <emph>do</emph>you think of eating?"</p>
            <p>"Sir," replied the beau, a little offended at the other's familiarity, "I consider it
               but a rude accomplishment."</p>
            <p>"Rude?" said Gabbleton. "That's very doubtful. Both the Greeks and the Romans — " He
               was proceeding full tilt, when he met with a check.</p>
            <p>"It is a common thing, Sir, nevertheless," interrupted Leverton. "The pigs partake of
               it with ourselves, and the dogs — <emph>they</emph> are absolute classics."</p>
            <p>"How so? How so? — if I may presume," enquired Gabbleton, who resented the
               comparison.</p>
            <p>"Why, Sir," replied the other, "they lie down while they eat their suppers; — and
               Cicero and Apicius did no more."</p>
            <p>"Who's that speaking of Cicero?" cried out Lord St. Stephens. "Cicero was a
               remarkable orator — a remarkable man!"</p>
            <p>There was not a dissentient voice! — </p>
            <p> — At this moment, John M 'Flip, who had been hitherto almost buried in plates of
               soup and turbot, having now a moment's leisure to contemplate the fare before and
               about him, espied something afar off, <pb n="274" xml:id="image329"/>which was a
               French composition, but which his patriotism converted into a national dish. "I'll
               joost thank ye for a bit o' the haggis;" called he, nodding at the same time to
               Leverton, who was opposite the mystery.</p>
            <p>"A — the gentleman asks for something?" said Leverton, looking round for an
               interpretation.</p>
            <p>"Ees not the deesh anent ye a haggis?" said Mac Flip, pointing to the object he
               required.</p>
            <p>"Bring a plate," said Leverton to the servant; which being brought, he separated an
               incredibly small piece from the main dish, and sent it in triumph to the hungry
               Scot.</p>
            <p>"Hoot awa;" said the other, half inclined openly to remonstrate (for he was new to
               society) — but the plate was already on its road, and he was compelled to endure his
               disappointment in silence.</p>
            <p>The company were by this time fully occupied: but, as the most agreeable things will
               have an end, so did the eaters and drinkers at Lord Trumpington's table submit, at
               last, to a respite from their pleasant toil. After various monosyllables, which
               gradually expanded into sentences, conversation arose — fluctuated — and at last
               settled upon the question of legislation. Upon this subject it appeared that Leverton
               and the Earl were opponents.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Leverton appears to think very little of the wisdom of our ancestors," observed
               Lord Trumpington, with a sneer.</p>
            <pb n="275" xml:id="image330"/>
            <p>"Very little," replied the beau, "upon many subjects; and legislation is one."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Leverton may rail in safety," retorted the Earl. "In old times — "</p>
            <p>"Were they not <emph>young</emph> times, my Lord?" enquired Leverton. "Ours are the
               old times, surely, and should be the wisest, if there be any thing in age."</p>
            <p>"I was about to observe," said the Earl, somewhat nettled, "that our ancestors —
               "</p>
            <p>"My dear Lord," said Di. "do not disturb our ancestors."</p>
            <p>The peer attempted to smile, (although excessively irritated at this second
               interruption) and proceeded without noticing her Ladyship's remark, to make good his
               case. But his opponent was not to be convinced without argument. The Earl 'asserted,'
               and 'pledged his reputation,' and brought forward his 'experience,' and quoted some
               indifferent sentences, which were not much to the purpose, without moving Leverton a
               jot.</p>
            <p>"Almost all the good," said the latter, "which our present laws possess, has arisen
               from the necessity of correcting the numberless mistakes of our ancestors. Our laws
               are nearly all amendments. Why have we not a plain, brief, wholesome code, where ‘all
               who run may read?"</p>
            <pb n="276" xml:id="image331"/>
            <p>"It is a thing totally out of the question," replied the Earl, decisively.</p>
            <p>"What would become of the Bar?" said one; "and of the Bench?" said another.</p>
            <p>"What would become of our brothers?" observed a third; "and our younger sons?"
               enquired a fourth, with a look of defiance.</p>
            <p>"True," answered Leverton, at last; "I beg your pardon, my Lord: I see the difficulty
               now."</p>
            <p>Here, Garnish, who had looked anxiously towards the Earl, and had hitherto trembled
               for his success, could contain his joy no longer, but laughed outright. The peer
               acknowledged his partizan with a smile; and turning, with a look of infinite
               condescension, towards Leverton, invited him to take wine.</p>
            <p>"I wish my victory to sit as pleasantly as possible upon Mr. Leverton; and shall
               therefore inflict nothing more upon him than a glass of hock."</p>
            <p>"I shall be happy to attack the tun of Heidelburg with your Lordship," replied the
               other; and the usual interchange of civilities passed.</p>
            <p>"Who is this Mer. Lep — Lepperton?" enquired the county of Baronet of his neighbour,
               the Earl, in a whisper.</p>
            <p>"He is a person of no consideration," replied the other in the same tone, "the son of
               some yeoman — or grazier — or — plebeian, in the west, as I think."</p>
            <pb n="277" xml:id="image332"/>
            <p>"What, a fellow who lived upon his own grass, like Nebuchadnezzar?" said the Baronet,
               laughing.</p>
            <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" echoed the Earl; "very good, Sir John, indeed — very good! Ha, ha, ha!"
               continued he, "your simile is undeniable — but — but, my good Sir John, this person —
               this Leverton — is a favorite with my Lady Trumpington, and is — as I hear — a person
               really in some — a — request in London."</p>
            <p>"I don't like these nobodies coming amongst us my lord," observed the other, "and —
               ."</p>
            <p>"Nor I, Sir John, nor I, I assure you," replied the Earl, "give me a little good
               blood, as I say with my horses, and I'll take my chance for the rest."</p>
            <p>"What!" said Lady Di. (who heard something of this last sentence) "did you speak of
               your horses, my Lord? I pledge my reputation that there has been a cross in your
               O'Kelly colts. Their quarters are coarse, and they run too rough in their coats for
               thorough-bred things. There's been a cross, and that you may depend on. Leverton,
               didn't you ask me to drink wine?"</p>
            <p>"<emph>I'll</emph> drink wine with you, Lady Di." said Fanny Dartley; and — </p>
            <p>"I shall be happy to submit to any thing in your Ladyship's service," replied
               Leverton, (whom the last speaker had not allowed time to answer,) "will you drink
               white Hermitage? or Moselle? or — ?"</p>
            <p>"I always drink port," said the lady.</p>
            <pb n="278" xml:id="image333"/>
            <p>"Who's that drinking port?" enquired Lord Bridewell, "I'll join 'em. Garnish, my boy,
               don't <emph>you</emph> like port?"</p>
            <p>"Immensely, my Lord, immensely," replied the other. "I give you my word I generally
               take port when I am alone — I may say generally," and he lifted the glass to his
               lips. It was scarcely there, however, before a question from the Earl removed it. He
               was called upon for his acquiescence, as to the merits of the Reverend Mr. Smatter;
               and never was assent more rapidly given.</p>
            <p>"Oh! certainly, my Lord, certainly," said he, bowing, "I admire Mr. Smatter
               prodigiously. He is a wonderful preacher, indeed; and then he is so sentimental — so
               melancholy — so Leverton, even you must allow that Mr. Smatter's melancholy sits most
               interestingly upon him?"</p>
            <p>"He mopes like a moulting chicken," said Lady Di. "I swear he always gives me the
               vapours."</p>
            <p>"He is, certainly, an infallible remedy for high spirits," said Leverton,
               assentingly. "He would throw a damp upon a funeral."</p>
            <p>"You will allow his style to be good, at least, Leverton?" persevered Garnish. "His
               style is grand."</p>
            <p>"It is superb!" said the Earl, with a tone that meant to put down all opposition.</p>
            <p>"The rogue's style is well enough," said Lever-<pb n="279" xml:id="image334"/>ton;
               "if it were but his own; but he has pilfered from Hooker, and Jeremy Taylor, and
               South, and half a dozen others, till his box of sermons is like a bazaar. I hear he
               is so thorough a mimic that when he lived at Sunning Hill and Hampstead, his lines
               all ran upwards to the right hand corner of the paper, and he never came down
               completely to level writing till he took to his house in Essex."</p>
            <p>"Dr. Rust thinks well of him, however," retorted Garnish, "and <emph>his</emph>
               opinion will carry him through."</p>
            <p>"Rust!" exclaimed the beau, and was proceeding to discuss the merits of the
               antiquary; when the earl (who saw that Garnish would never be able to make head
               against his antagonist) stepped in to his relief, with more chivalry than wisdom. He
               attempted a diversion.</p>
            <p>"You have seen Dr. Rust's collection of valuable antiquities?"said he.</p>
            <p>"I have seen them all," replied Leverton — (who thought that the question, which was
               addressed to the baronet, was directed towards himself) — "I have seen them, one by
               one, I believe, from first to last; and himself — the greatest wonder of all!"</p>
            <p>"He has the strangest complexion," — lisped Lady Selina.</p>
            <p>"Ah, madam!" said Leverton, "were he and his old monstrosities once thoroughly
               scoured, you would know neither the one nor the other."</p>
            <p>"His antiquities," observed the earl — </p>
            <pb n="280" xml:id="image335"/>
            <p>"I hate antiquities," said Lady Di. — "but I beg pardon; I think you said that you
               had seen them, Leverton?"</p>
            <p>"I saw a mass of things," answered the beau, "but little distinctly, — broken
               statues; dingy pictures; belts of wampum; rings for the nose; fish bones for the
               ears; druids' clubs; absurdities of every kind, from the equator to the poles.
               Nothing was wanting — that was useless. There were sixteen tons of Egyptian horrors
               blocking up the approach to the house; and five and twenty hundred weight of cracked
               marble, which I took for a cistern, but which turned out to be the coffin of Ptolemy
               Psammeticus. Every corner of every room was put in requisition. The hall was full;
               the staircase was fuller; the dining-room could not be carpeted for these monsters.
               Heads, legs, arms, noses, hideous little wretches in bronze and china affronted you
               at every turn. Even the cellar was blocked up by a shapeless person, which the doctor
               called Alexander, or Demetrius, or — I forget what; and we had a tedious harangue on
               a foolish subject, instead of a bottle of Madeira with our sandwiches.</p>
            <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" said the earl, at last.</p>
            <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" responded Garnish.</p>
            <pb n="281" xml:id="image336"/>
            <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" continued the earl, evidently much irritated — "ha, ha, ha! — the
                  <emph>original</emph> Theseus! I take upon myself — I say <emph>myself</emph> — to
               commit my self — <emph>my</emph> opinion — that <emph>that</emph> is the original
               marble. There is a copy (a much later work) in my Lord Elgin's collection."</p>
            <p>"It is certainly by a different hand," said Leverton.</p>
            <p>"Well — ?" said Lady Di.</p>
            <p>"Well, madam," continued the beau, "there was an infinite deal of nothing, I assure
               you. There was a head of Jupiter Stator, without a nose, receiving adoration from a
               couple of sphinxes; and a Cupid with one eye shooting at a damaged countess, by
               Vandyke. There — "</p>
            <p>"He would hold a <emph>living</emph> countess in contempt, I suppose," said Lady
               Di.</p>
            <p>"Assuredly, madam; he would behold her with supreme indifference," answered Leverton.
               "Old Lady Stately (who measured six feet one, in her — shoes) was the only female
               that ever attracted his admiration. After gazing at her for five minutes, with
               evident symptoms of delight, he turned to his neighbour and
                  exclaimed"<emph>What</emph> a mummy she would make!"</p>
            <p>"The old fool!" exclaimed Lady Di.</p>
            <p>"Nevertheless, we must do the doctor justice," proceeded Leverton.
                  "He<emph>has</emph> his living pets, I <pb n="282" xml:id="image337"/>assure you.
               There is his parrot, which his aunt Ricketts bequeathed to him, and which, he says,
               came over with Sir Francis Drake" — </p>
            <p>"That is a solitary instance," observed somebody.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," replied Leverton, "he has a very pretty little colony of mice; and a rat
               from Java: two rattle snakes, and an alligator — but no, that is stuffed: however, he
               has an old friend — a tame duck, who was made a happy widow last Michaelmas; her
               husband having been put into requisition (by mistake!) for giblet soup, after a hard
               life of seventeen years, spent in the green pond at the back of the stable."<gap/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap/>And so the dialogue ran on, (long after the ladies had retired), veering from
               one thing to another, public and private. War — commerce — literature — art — the
               manufacturing classes — the landed interest — their friends — their enemies — all
               were separately and more than sufficiently discussed. Each attempted to take the lead
               on some particular subject. The Earl was tedious and arrogant, beyond all measure, on
               general politics. Colonel Dartley chattered a vast quantity of nothing upon "the
               service;" and the county baronet prosed on agriculture, till her fell asleep in his
               chair.</p>
            <p>Every man talked his worst, till is hearers were tired: one with the austere tone of
               a reasoner — <pb n="283" xml:id="image338"/>another with the solemnity of a prophet.
               This proved that right was wrong: that, that mankind and art were declining — a
               third, that both were springing up and rallying afresh. Every one saw into the future
               — many provided for its wants — no one was at a loss — no one was short-sighted — no
               one less than infallible. — </p>
            <p>Oh! what a comical thing it is, reader — is it not? To hear (or read) the opinions of
               some of these positive sages; to scan their unassailable arguments, proving that so
               and so can <emph>not</emph> be done by reason of the physical and moral force, etc.
               [sic] -and then to see that this very impossibility is done! As if nations could not
               be stirred out of their ordinary apathy by the descent of a sudden truth, or stung to
               the strength of madness by some great and intolerable wrong. In speculations,
               especially, men never reckon upon their own fallibility; nor upon the
                  <emph>change</emph> which the great wheel of Time is eternally producing, as it
               rolls onwards, — crumbling the puny frost-work of the politician's brains, and
               scattering wonders of all sorts for the benefit of succeeding ages, and the
               employment of every faculty of the mind of man!</p>

            <p>On word in conclusion — </p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, — Harry Leverton is no more! Although not an insubstantial phantasm
               of the imagination, like the Eastern Horam, yet he has <pb n="284" xml:id="image339"
               />vanished, and left, like that sage, his valuable moral behind him; — somewhat of
               this, indeed, springing from his example, (which was at once a model and a warning);
               but some little also he bequeathed in the shape of precept. -After basking in
               cloudless popularity, and having at his beck all the solid advantages of life, as
               well as the courtesies which make those advantages delightful, he was obliged to
               visit his estates in the West Indies; where — at the expiration of a tedious illness,
               which wore the character rather of languor and ennui than of serious malady — he
               died; disappearing like some of those volatile essences, which are so pungent and
               pleasant while they last, but being transferred into a warm situation, vanish or
               evaporate, from causes which the chemist or physician can alone detect.</p>

            <p>THE palace of Nonsuch, near Ewell, in Surrey, was intended by Henry the Eighth, as
               its proud title sufficiently attests, to afford an unrivalled specimen of his
               magnificence and taste; but, while he was lavishing his treasures in this most
               unnecessary addition to his royal residences, Death was sharpening the dart which was
               to tumble down the ostentatious tyrant, and consign him to his last narrow palace —
               the tomb.</p>
            <p>Nonsuch was left unfinished, and unfulfilled promise of splendour, a gorgeous and yet
               melancholy evidence of the uncertainty of human grandeur; and Queen Mary, shrinking
               from the cost of its completion, had it in contemplation to ull it down to save
               farther charges; when the Earl of Arundel, "for the love and honour he bore to his
               old master," purchased the place, and finished it according to the original design.
               Not a vestige of it now remains; it has passed away with the other elaborate gewgaws
               of <pb n="286" xml:id="image343"/>mortal vanity, and the arrogant name which it has
               left behind it, sounds in our ears like a mournful echo, mocking the presumption of
               other times. And yet the proud structure was not deficient in solidity as well as
               stateliness. "It was built round two courts," says the accomplished authoress of
               Queen Elizabeth's Memoirs — "an outer and an inner one, both very spacious; and the
               entrance to each was by a square gate-house highly ornamented, embattled, and having
               turrets at the four corners. These gate-houses were of stone, as was the lower story
               of the palace itself; but the upper one was of wood, "richly adorned, and set forth
               and garnished with a variety of statues, pictures, and other antic forms of excellent
               art and workmanship, and of no small cost;" all which ornaments, it seems, were made
               of rye dough. In modern language the pictures would probably be called
               basso-relievos. From the eastern and western angles of the inner court rose two
               slender turrets, five stories high, with lanterns on the top, which were leaded and
               surrounded with wooden balustrades. These towers of observation, from which the two
               parks attached to the palace, and a wide expanse of champaign country beyond, might
               be surveyed as in a map, were celebrated as the peculiar boast of Nonsuch.</p>
            <p>It was the morning of Michaelmas Eve, the woodwork of the gaudy structure which was
               painted and <pb n="287" xml:id="image344"/>lacquered, glistered in the light of a
               cloudless sun the numerous gilt vanes, fashioned in the shapes of the various animals
               that figured in the armorial bearings of royalty, flashed form the top of every tower
               and pinnacle; while the royal banners displayed from the summits of the two lofty
               turrets, and flaunting proudly on the breeze, announced to all the circumjacent
               country that they floated over Queen Elizabeth and her Court, who were then residing
               in the palace. Although it was thus graced and honoured, the earliness of the hour,
               and the heat of the morning, had prevented any great appearance of bustle around the
               exterior of the building. A few halberdiers and yeomen of the guard, in their rich
               liveries, were lounging in front of the outer gate-house; along the roads that
               skirted the parks, horses and carriages, betraying their progress by the dust, were
               seen to converge towards the same point; but in other respects, the landscape was as
               still as it was lovely. The herds of deer in the park, only distinguishable by their
               horns, were crouching in the shade: the cows, that were usually pastured around the
               gatehouse, had not yet returned from the farm, whither they had been driven to be
               milked; and with the exception of a single stately stag which emerged from a thicket,
               as if to reconnoiter, and snuff up the morning air, nothing appeared to move within
               the wide chase that surrounded the mansion; while the absence of <pb n="288"
                  xml:id="image345"/>music, or any other sound of state or revelry from the walls,
               gave reason to conclude that her majesty had not yet arisen from her slumbers.</p>
            <p>Upon a terrace, however, which flanked the exterior of the inner court, and
               communicated by a flight of stone steps with the park, was assembled a little party,
               who had obeyed the first summons of Chanticleer, in the loyal and laudable hope of
               affording good entertainment to their royal mistress, when it should please her to
               begin the sports and pastimes of the day. Among these was old Yeovil, one of the
               huntsmen, a withered weatherbeaten figure, but with a patch of red upon either
               cheek-bone, that seemed to attest he might still be in at a good many deaths before
               his own. He held three leash of greyhounds by leathern thongs, and was surrounded by
               several couple of staghounds, most of the latter being crouched at his feet, dosing
               and winking at the sun; while the former with ears erect, and in various graceful
               attitudes of alert attention, were imitating their master in watching the movements
               of a motley group immediately opposite to them. It consisted of <emph>Master</emph>
               Toby so called from his being at the head of the scullery, and who for the nonce had
               constituted himself, moreover, a sort of deputy master of the revels; and a troop of
               extempore maskers, collected from among the inferior domestics, who had agreed to get
               up a little pageant among themselves, stuffed full of ful-<pb n="289"
                  xml:id="image346"/>some compliments to the queen, and according to the fashion of
               the time, most fantastically allegorical. Shakspeare's ridicule, and the burlesque of
               Bottom the Weaver, had not been yet long enough before the public to banish the rage
               for such emblematic foolery: nor would it under any circumstances have been likely to
               exert a beneficial influence upon Master Toby, who sometimes made furtive excursions
               from the scullery into the regions of Parnassus, and whose taste had been exclusively
               derived from the quaint devices of those symbolical banquets he had assisted in
               cooking; and which, from their hieroglyphical character, had received the appropriate
               name of Subtleties. At this self-appointed masque-master, who with a paper in one
               hand, and a cane in the other, was strutting about, endeavouring to get up a
               rehearsal as well among the amateur actors by whom he was surrounded, some of whom
               were attired as allegorical females, the calm old huntsman gazed with a quiet
               wonderment, that kept his face fixed in an intermediate expression between a simper
               and a sneer. And, sooth to say, they must have exhibited a puzzling sort of
               cross-reading to a straightforward man like him, who knew all the parties by sight,
               but neither understood why they were thus strangely metamorphosed, nor comprehended
               the purport of what they were instructed to utter.</p>
            <p>The man who was to misrepresent Diana having <pb n="290" xml:id="image347"/>thrown up
               his legs on a bench, in defiance of petticoats and decorum, and all the
                  <emph>bienseances</emph> that should distinguish the "chaste huntress of the
               silver bow;" swore "by cogs nouns, and snails," in answer to the summons of Master
               Toby, that he would not come to book 'til he had finished his pipe; in confirmation
               of which averment he spat upon the ground, and recommenced his whiffs with such
               energy, that the half-moon in his head was only occasionally seen as it dimly emerged
               from the cloud of tobacco-smoke in which it was enveloped.</p>
            <p>"Come, then, Cupid, we will begin with you, have you got your speech quite perfect?"
               said Master Toby, to a little boy, who had twisted his wings all awry in the
               earnestness of a game of marbles with an urchin of his own age.</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir, yes;" replied the son of Venus. "Fain dubs, Jemmy! fain tribbs! Knuckle
               down, Jemmy! fain going through the ring a second time! Keep your yard's distance,
               and no cheating!"</p>
            <p>Pittikins! you young scapegrace! call you this saying the speech?" exclaimed Toby, in
               wrath. "Spout it, sirrah, spout it, or your shoulders shall be scored with my rattan
               till they show like ribs of pork."</p>
            <p>"Nay, now, forsooth, Master Toby, let us finish the game, there's a good fellow. Its
               my go next, and there are only three in the ring. And look you <pb n="291"
                  xml:id="image348"/>her's lazy Barney Mumpford falling asleep in the sun for want
               of something to do. Hallo, Barney! Barney!" continued the stripling, bawling in his
               ear; "there's Master Toby waiting for you to begin."</p>
            <p> The person thus aroused, whose close doublet and hose were thickly painted with
               tongues to give him the semblance of Report of Fame, now got lazily up, and after
               some very deliberate stretching and yawning begun his speech, which he spouted with a
               sort of drowsy pomposity. As it was intended to compliment the queen, not less upon
               the wide diffusion of her glory than upon her extensive knowledge of languages or
               tongues, it commenced after the following fashion:</p>
            <p>"To the four quarters of the earth I've blown</p>
            <p>Eliza's name; I need not add my own.</p>
            <p>Useless to her would such a blazon be,</p>
            <p>For she who knows all tongues must needs know me!" — </p>
            <p>"By my fackins, though, Master Toby," cried the spokesman, breaking off in the very
               exordium of his address, "if her grace should ask my name after all, I shall e'en
               tell her that I'm Barney Mumpford, that I have been a groom seven years, and that the
               post-master of the great stables is vacant; for I may as well have it as another, and
               a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse."</p>
            <p>With a look of profound alarm, the culinary stage-<pb n="292" xml:id="image349"
               />manager declared that such a departure from histrionic precedent would infallibly
               bring them all into disgrace, and reminded his pupil that he ought to have announced
               himself in the first instance by blowing his trumpet.</p>
            <p>"Odso! And so I ought," cried Barney; "and I need not have forgotten it, for I found
               that part easier to learn by heart than all the rest."</p>
            <p>So saying her put the instrument to his mouth, and summoning all his breath to his
               aid, gave birth to a discordant bray, which seemed to have had a groan and a roar for
               its respective parents. At this abortive effort, old Yeovil, who from childhood
               upwards had been accustomed to wind every instrument of the sort from a penny trumpet
               to a French horn, could no longer remain a passive spectator; but seizing the trumpet
               and applying it to his mouth, he collected the breath into his hollow leathern
               cheeks, and blew so loud and lusty a recheat, that the inner court echoed to the
               sound, the dogs suddenly leaped up, baying and barking, and at the same moment, a
               gentleman-usher, issuing form the offices, rebuked them angrily, as a set of
               unmannerly grooms and brawling mummers, to keep such a coil ere the breakfast-bell
               had warned in the great court, and when it was even uncertain whether her Highness
               had quitted her bed-room.</p>
            <p>"I would give a Harry groat," said Yeovil, "to <pb n="293" xml:id="image350"/>know
               whether her grace means to betake herself to the stand in the park to see the
               coursing, or whether we are to uncouple the hounds, and drive up a fat buck for the
               cross-bow, for the morning begins to wear, and the dew will be soon off the
               grass."</p>
            <p>"Body o' me!" ejaculated Master Toby, drawing himself up, and looking contemptuously
               at the huntsman; "think you our noble and learned mistress will recreate herself with
               brute beasts, when she might listen to the Orphean strains of poetry that I have
               provided for her in this our most quaint, dainty, and delectable device? Now, good
               man Report, pursue your speech — pursue your speech — 'accept, fair, peerless,
               learned, virgin queen — "</p>
            <p>"Grammercy! Master Toby," quoth Report — "four lines at a stretch is honest yeoman's
               work, you must get some one else to accept the queen, for it is clean beyond me to go
               any further." Not less indignant as a poet than as a loyal subject at this
               declaration, master Toby was about to pronounce a severe reprimand upon Goodman
               Report, when he was forestalled by a loud laugh from the four quarters of the world,
               who were standing in the shade playing at chuck-arthing with Saint Michael, which
               latter personage had been dressed up to do honor to his own approaching eve. Africa
               and the Saint, after wrangling for some time about a farthing, had betaken
               themselves, like true Englishmen, to swearing, and <pb n="294" xml:id="image351"
               />then to mutual accusations of profaneness; when the Saint, pointing to is
               adversary's visage, which was smeared over with a sooty pigment to give him the
               better semblance of a negro, declared that he must needs have been the greatest
               offender, since he had sworn till he was black in the face. This joke was received
               with a huge and simultaneous burst of laughter by Europe, Asia, and America, although
               they were repeatedly called to order, and were threatened with the tattan by the
               wrathful master Toby. Finding his four refractory quarters to be indifferent to his
               menaces, the latter now betook himself to father Thames, a venerable looking figure
               with a crown of bulrushes, a long beard of sedge and water-flags, and wearing a loose
               watchet robe, which having fallen back while he was emptying a pot of ale, disclosed
               a pair of greasy buckskin hose, with riding boots and spurs. "Zooks, master Toby, let
               us finish the tankard — you know the Thames is apt to be dry at this season," cried
               the river god, chuckling at his own wit. "Dry quotha! methinks you're always adry,"
               replied Toby — "but beshrew me an I ever knew the Thames to be replenished with
               humming ale, where's your urn?" "Here, master Toby, here," said father Thames,
               thrusting a large pitcher under his left arm, and where's the tinsel stream that is
               to come pouring out of it?" "I popp'd it inside to keep it dry, for there was an ugly
               dew this morn-<pb n="295" xml:id="image352"/>ing that would presently have washed off
               all the glitter."</p>
            <p>"By my fackins! that was well cared for: keep your water dry whatever you do: hold
               your urn more sloping, and though that cannot spout, you many spout away
               yourself."</p>
            <p>Thus instructed and commended, the river god lifting up his voice, which was by no
               means so clear and liquid as the character required, exclaimed,</p>
            <p>"On my proud breast those floating castles ride,</p>
            <p>That did subdue the great Armada's pride;</p>
            <p>Behold illustrious Queen — "</p>
            <p>when his progress was not less suddenly than unpleasantly interrupted by a freak of
               the mischievous urchin, Cupid, who, having finished his game of marbles, and lighted
               a piece of paper by the assistance of Diana's pipe, slily insinuated it into the
               river god's left hand, as it hung dangling beneath his urn. Little expecting to be
               thus surreptitiously set on fire, father Thames, uttering a cry of surprise and pain,
               let fall the pitcher, which was smashed into a hundred pieces, and bounded forward a
               good clothier's yard at a single leap. No sooner, however, had he discovered the
               little incendiary, who betrayed himself by a shriek of laughter, than with fury in
               his looks he blustered out an oath, much too combustible for so aqueous a divinity,
               and commenced an immediate <pb n="296" xml:id="image353"/>pursuit for the purpose of
               inflicting a summary vengeance. In less than a minute the offender had run twice
               round Africa, crossed Europe, scudded behind the back of Asia, and swung round the
               front of America; but Scamander when he pursued the runaway Achilles was not more
               swift or unrelenting than father Thames in his chace of the unlucky Cupid, who having
               thrown away his wings that he might fly the faster, at length bolted across the
               terrace through a postern gate that led into the inner court, his pursuer followed
               close upon his heels, and both were presently out of sight and hearing. Ere the
               laughter occasioned by this incident had subsided among the rest of the party to whom
               the fugitives belonged, their attention was arrested by a company of horsemen riding
               towards the palace at full speed, and leaving a long cloud of dust behind them. As
               they galloped past the end of the terrace, in order to wheel round towards the
               gate-house, it was evident they had travelled far and fast, and through a different
               tract of country from that which surrounded Nonsuch; for both horses and riders were
               splashed with mud and mire, over which a white powdery dust had settled, until it had
               become impossible to distinguish the colour of either steed or garment, although it
               was sufficiently evident from their accoutrements, feathers and bearing, that the
               leading cavaliers were officers. At the head of the band, mounted on a fleet barb,
               was <pb n="297" xml:id="image354"/>a young gallant, who, as far as could be judged
               from the great rapidity with which he passed, possessed singular beauty of form and
               feature, and appeared to be a most graceful and accomplished horseman. Four others,
               although they rode a little way behind him, seemed by their gestures to be his
               friends and companions, and at a distance of ten or twenty yards was the rear of the
               cavalcade, consisting of grooms and other attendants. Without relaxing his speed
               until he reached the entrance of the great gatehouse, the leader of the troop threw
               himself hastily from his horse, and hurried into the court with the air of one whose
               rank and station authorized him to pass, even into the residence of royalty, without
               let or question; although the yeomen of the guard looked somewhat anxiously at one
               another, as if they ought to have demanded his purpose before they suffered him to
               enter. At the portal which formed the entrance to the queen's dwelling apartments,
               and through which the stranger would have speeded in the same unceremonious manner as
               before, the pages, gentlemen ushers, and others, who were clustered about the doors,
               and who were startled at the appearance of such a soiled and bespattered figure,
               forcing himself, as it were, into the private chambers, drew up and opposed his
               progress, enquiring at the same time who he was, and what he wanted. "Gentlemen,"
               said the stranger, impatiently waving his hand for them to <pb n="298"
                  xml:id="image355"/>fall back, "my purpose brooks not delay, and I beseech you not
               to parley with me but to give me free passage. What! am I so changed by a little mud
               and dirt that ye know me not for the Earl of Essex, Master of the Horse, and of the
               Ordnance, and the Lord Deputy?" So saying, and without giving them time to recover
               from their surprise, he passed through the midst of them, and began to ascend the
               stairs.</p>
            <p>Labouring under heavy imputations for his misconduct in Ireland, from which country
               he had suddenly returned, notonly without leave, but in positive disobedience to the
               commands of his royal mistress; relying upon her well-known affection for his pardon,
               and complete restoration to favor, if he could once gain access to her, and
               apprehensive that if he failed in this object his enemies would ensure his disgrace
               and ruin, the impetuous earl had ridden post both day and night, without
               communicating his purpose to a single individual, except a few of his particular
               adherents, and having thus far successfully triumphed over all obstacles, he was not
               likely to be impeded by the pages and chamberlains whom he encountered in the private
               apartments, as he hurried through them. Gazing in utter amazement at such a
               bespattered figure, making the floors ring to his heavy riding boots as he stalked
               onwards towards the queen's bedroom, some stood aloof, concluding that he had
               explained his errand to the yeomen below; <pb n="299" xml:id="image356"/>while others
               placed themselves in his way, and informed him that the Queen had not yet come forth:
               but he either passed them, or put them aside, with the air of one who would not be
               disobeyed, and thus traversed the presence chamber, and the waiting room of the maids
               of honor, several of whom were not a little alarmed at the sight of such an
               inexplicable apparition. Neither noticing their startled looks, nor heeding their
               eager whispers, the adventurous Earl pursued his way, and never stopped till he came
               to the Queen's bed-room, the door of which he undauntedly opened, walked in, and
               closed it behind him.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth was newly risen, and her locks were hanging in disorder about her face. She
               was incapable of fear, but her surprise was not without agitation at the first sight
               of a heated and bemoiled stranger thus intruding into her bed-room, and she was on
               the point of calling out for her chamberlain, when Essex rushed forward, threw
               himself upon his knees, and humbly implored her pardon. The sound of his well-known
               voice, the humility of his language, and, above all, the sight of one whom she still
               loved, kneeling at her feet, and looking up to her with flushed and imploring
               features, so won upon her unprepared heart, that she held out both her hands to him
               to kiss, listened with a kind aspect to all his excuses, and gave him a more cordial
               reception than even his fondest hopes had ventured to anticipate. <pb n="300"
                  xml:id="image357"/>Weak as a woman, although great and illustrious as a sovereign,
               she now suffered the former character to predominate, and Essex, who with all his
               headstrong impetuosity was not deficient in the courtier's art, took good advantage
               of the mood in which he found her. Attributing his unsanctioned return to the
               impossibility of existing any longer out of the presence of a divinity, whose sight
               was as vital to him as was the breath of heaven to his nostrils, he addressed her in
               terms of passionate, and even romantic gallantry, talked of her excellent beauties,
               though she was now in her sixty-seventh year, compared her at once to Venus and
               Minerva, to a nymph goddess, and angel, quoted Latin and Greek in confirmation of his
               assertions, and played his part so successfully, that leaving her after a conference
               of some duration, he appeared in high spirits, and thanked God that though he had
               suffered many storms abroad, he had found a sweet calm at home.</p>
            <p>Having taken some refreshment, and attired himself in his most splendid suit, as some
               atonement for the unseemly habiliments in which he had before presented himself,
               Essex, who had been invited to repeat his visit to the palace, was sallying forth for
               that purpose, when he was accosted by a personage, who respectfully vailing his
               beaver, and presenting a letter, would have explained its object had he not been
               anticipated by the Earl's exclaiming — "Ha, <pb n="301" xml:id="image358"/>Will
               Shakspeare! what makest thou at Nonsuch, when thou shouldst be playing the ghost to
               the holiday folks in London, and easing them of their Michaelmas testers?"</p>
            <p>The poet replied that he had come to Ewel with his friend Dick Burbage to solicit of
               the Queen a Licence for their theatre, and that his gracious patron, the Earl of
               Southampton, who was now unfortunately under her Majesty's heavy displeasure, had
               condescended to give him a letter to his special good friend the Lord Essex,
               bespeaking his influence and kind offices as soon as he should return from Ireland.
               Of this happy event the bard declared that he had entertained no immediate
               expectation; but having learnt, within the last half hour, that his lordship had
               actually arrived at Nonsuch, he had been emboldened to deliver the letter with which
               he had been thus honored. "Grammercy! master Shakspeare!" cried the Earl after
               hastily glancing over the paper, "I am myself but a newly pardoned criminal, and
               therefore little warranted to become a suitor; but I feel too happy in her grace's
               favor not to wish to extend it to others. There are few things in which I would not
               venture to pleasure the Lord Southampton: and it would like me no less to serve the
               merry varlet, or the soul-stirring bard, (which shall I call thee?) whose lofty lines
               ever seem to me to o'ertop all praise, 'till they are clean eclipsed by his quaint
               and comic fantasies. <pb n="302" xml:id="image359"/>So forward! with me to the
               garden, and if I may speed your suit, it shall not lack a willing advocate."</p>
            <p>The poet bowed his thanks, and followed at a short distance behind the Earl, who,
               however, turned round and conversed familiarly with him till they entered the
               gardens, which according to the prevailing taste were laid out in trim beds, formal
               parterres, fountains, and successive terraces, communicating withone another by
               flights of stone steps, and ornamented with vases, statues, and groupes of sculpture.
               At the extremity of one of these terraces stood a little pavilion called the
               Paradise, being decorated with representations of Adam and Eve, the Serpent and the
               Tree of Knowledge; and having an arbour for its entrance engrailed with clustering
               althaeas, jessamines, honeysuckles, roses, pomegranates, and other flowering shrubs,
               all of which were in full bloom and fragrance. Within this odorous and shady bower,
               the Queen, who had been observed to bestow an unusual attention that morning upon her
               toilet, was seated, holding a large feather fan, and surrounded by several maids of
               honor, all standing. Behind them, within the pavilion, were seen other female
               attendants employed in caul work: lutes and citharas, with cards and a richly
               enamell'd chess board were lying upon a marble table by their side. Upon approaching
               the august figure of royalty thus picturesquely enthroned, the Earl fell upon his
               knees, an act of homage which <pb n="303" xml:id="image360"/>her Majesty always
               exacted, even from her ministers in their audiences of business; and Shakspeare,
               halting at some little distance, immediately imitated his example. Essex found a no
               less gracious reception than he had experienced in the morning, for the remembrance
               of his flattery had not yet passed away, and their conference had lasted for some
               time when the Queen, looking towards Shakspeare, enquired whether his squire, who
               seemed but young in years, had left his locks in the hands of the Irish rebels, that
               he wore so bald a brow. "I much fear me that I am presumptuous and overbold," said
               the Earl after having mentioned the name and object of his attendant. "I who am
               myself but a petitioner for mercy and forgiveness, in thus becoming a suitor for
               others; but since your majesty's condescension has so soon forgotten my offences, I
               may perhaps stand better excused now than at another time, for forgetting
               myself."</p>
            <p>"So, this is the dramatic chronicler," said the queen, who had felt much interest in
               his historical plays; "let him approach; we would have speech of him; and you, my
               lord, may avail yourself of yonder seat, for after so long and so speedy a journey
               you may well need a little rest."</p>
            <p>Bowing as he accepted the permission thus given to him, Essex beckoned to the poet,
               who approached, and concluding that he had been invited to imitate <pb n="304"
                  xml:id="image361"/>his patron, seated himself upon a low garden stool, beside the
               earl, and immediately opposite to the Queen. So unusually gracious was the present
               mood of Elizabeth, that she smiled at a mistake which at another moment might have
               excited her indignation, and waved her hand to her attendants as a signal that they
               might retire into the pavilion, a notice which they instantly obeyed. Essex, catching
               the expression of the Queen's face with the alacrity of a courtier, smiled also:
               while Shakspeare, perfectly unconscious that he had committed any violation of court
               etiquette, read his petition with a respectful propriety, that might well atone for
               his little oversight.</p>
            <p>"Look you, Master Playwright," graciously exclaimed her majesty when he had
               concluded; "your writings like us well, but touching this licence for playing more
               frequently, here is our head Bearward who has been lately complaining to us most
               piteously that you have become his worst enemy, for that when the flag is flying at
               your theatre of the Globe, his garden is so deserted by the people, that his best
               bear will scarcely pay the baiting. How say you to this?"</p>
            <p>"I dare not misprise his calling, since it has ever found a gracious patron in your
               majesty," replied the bard; "but under favour I would venture to affirm that he who
               withdraws his fellow subjects from such <pb n="305" xml:id="image362"/>pastimes, and
               instructs them in their country's annals, and points out to their admiration the
               glory of their monarchs, (than whom none have been more illustrious than your
               majesty's immediate ancestors) can hardly fail to civilize and exalt the people,
               though he may find it impossible to add to the renown of the sovereign."</p>
            <p> "It is well, and wisely, and loyally urged," said the Queen, evidently pleased with
               the speech; "and, by my troth! it may chance to speed the licence for which you are
               our petitioner. And what led you to our musty chronicles, Sir Poet, when your
               playwright's art might have found better range in the wider walks of fancy and
               invention?"</p>
            <p> "My grand-father fought with good approof in the battle of Bosworth Field," said
               Shakespeare, not sorry to have an excuse for mentioning the circumstance, "and was
               fortunate enough to find favour with your grace's ancestor, the valiant King Henry
               the Seventh. From him and from my father I have inherited a love of loyalty and of my
               country's glory; and as I despaired of doing justice to such splendid deeds as the
               defeat of the Armada, and the other exploits that have glorified your grace's reign,
               I was driven to record the annals of your less illustrious predeccessors."</p>
            <p>"Beshrew me," said the Queen, in an under voice to Essex, "if I have ever heard a
               varlet speak <pb n="306" xml:id="image363"/>more honorably, or pithily to the
               purpose. And yet," she continued, again addressing herself to Shakespeare, "if we
               forget us not, thou hast somewhere ventured an allusion to our royal self. The
               passage stays not with us, but we have forgiven it, though it coupled our name if we
               mistake not, with some idle flower."</p>
            <p>Elizabeth perfectly remembered the lines, though she would not appear to attach so
               much importance to them, as to have thought them worthy her recollection. Essex
               however, who saw the real motives of her reserve, and knew that she would be pleased
               with the quotation, exclaimed, "your Majesty may pardon both the poet and myself,
               when we do but recall a Midsummer Night's Dream;" and then looking passionately at
               the Queen he continued:</p>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>"That very time I saw (but thou couldst not)</l>
               <l>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</l>
               <l>Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took</l>
               <l>At a fair vestal throned by the West,</l>
               <l>And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</l>
               <l>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</l>
               <l>But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft</l>
               <l>Quench'd in the chste beams of the watery moon;</l>
               <l>And the imperial votaress passed on</l>
               <l>In maiden meditation, fancy free.</l>
               <l>Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</l>
               <l>It fell upon a little western flower,</l>
               <l>Before milk-white; now purpled with love's wound,</l>
               <l>And maidens call it, "Love in Idleness."</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="307" xml:id="image364"/>
            <p>"It ran even thus, but I took you not, my lord, for so shrewd a remembrancer," said
               the queen.</p>
            <p>"The lines might easily have passed from out my head," replied the Earl, "but they
               related to my admired sovereign, and therefore were they treasured in my heart of
               hearts." He laid his hand upon his breast as he spoke; Elizabeth looked pleased,
               though she noticed not the speech, but turning to Shakspeare, resumed, "we have
               already passed our pardon for this liberty of your pen, wherefore we rebuke it not;
               and touching the licence that you seek, it shall be even as you wish, and our
               secretary shall have order to prepare the patent."</p>
            <p>"I shall be ever bound to pray for your gracious majesty," said the poet, bowing
               profoundly. "God's pity! sir; they tell me that you playwrights be but scant sayers
               of your prayers, and since they are henceforward to be put up for our own well and
               welfare, you shall neither lack the means to proffer them, nor a memorial of her for
               whom you pray." So saying, Elizabeth took a volume from a low table that stood beside
               her chair, and graciously extended it to Shakspeare with these words: "The Queen
               presents you her prayer-book: you may retire."<note place="foot"
                  resp="Author, Horace Smith" anchored="true">[Note to "Essex and the Maid of
                  Honour":] The book thus presented Shakespeare, we may suppose to be that beautiful
                  and rare volume, described by Dr. Dibdin in his Bibliographical Decameron, and
                  known among collectors as Queen Elizabeth's Prayer Book. Through the friendship of
                  Mr. Freeling (from a copy in his possession) the Proprietors are enabled to
                  present an admirable facsimile of one leaf. The extract, is part of a prayer by
                  the celebrated John Fox, author of the Book of Martyrs. Dr. Dibdin says, "I wish I
                  knew more of the private history of this elegant volume at all events if you feel
                  disposed to loosen your purse strings, purchase one of the earlier editions of it,
                  on account of the superior sharpness or truth of the outline." The Doctor adds
                  that the first edition is dated 1569, the second 1578, the third 1581, the fourth
                  1590, and the fifth 1608. [Author, Horace Smith.]</note> Judging from the latter
               command <pb n="308" xml:id="image365"/>that he was not expected to express his
               gratitude, the poet kissed the volume with great reverence, pressed it to his heart,
               and retired from the royal presence with repeated obeisances, not less delighted at
               the success of his suit, than flattered by so signal a testimony of her Majesty's
               favour and condescension.</p>
            <p>After a prolonged conference, in which he had every reason to believe that he had
               completely re-instated himself in the Queen's favour, Essex also withdrew, descending
               the terraces, and crossing towards a postern gate of the park. In this route he most
               unfortunately encountered the fair Mrs. Bridges, one of the maids of honor, with whom
               he had long been suspected of being deeply in love, and who on his account had
               already been exposed to the wrath, and even the blows of her royal mistress.
               Imagining <pb n="309" xml:id="image366"/>himself to be screened from observation, the
               enamoured Earl accosted her in such terms of fervent and high-flown gallantry as were
               then in vogue among the courtiers, and placing a small collar of chrystals around her
               neck, which he declared that he had brought from Ireland expressly for her wearing,
               he would have detained her still longer in dalliance, had not his Innamorata hurried
               away, urging the necessity of resuming her attendance upon the Queen. Although her
               Majesty had been so embowered in the arbour as not to be visible to Essex, she had
               unluckily been following him with her eyes, through a treacherous loop-hole of the
               leaves, and with a rage-envenomed heart had witnessed the whole transaction.</p>
            <p>It was not without a considerable struggle that she could prevent an immediate
               explosion of her fury and assume a forced composure of look and voice as she
               exclaimed to the approaching offender, "So, mistress! you can find time to wait upon
               us when you have finished your amorous foolery with the Lord Deputy. If there be
               neither treason nor immodesty in the avowal, we would fain know what passages passed
               between you."</p>
            <pb n="310" xml:id="image367"/>
            <p>"Ay, with such haste," interposed the Queen, "that you have left your partlet all
               awry."</p>
            <p>"Nothing would dissuade his lordship," resumed Mistress Bridges, blushing still
               deeper, as she adjusted her ruff, "but he must needs place this Irish carcanet around
               my neck."</p>
            <p>At this confession Elizabeth could restrain herself no longer. Quick as lightning she
               bestowed upon her trembling rival a violent box on the ear, tore the collar from her
               neck, dashed it to the ground, and exclaimed with a look, and voice that sufficiently
               declared her to be the daughter of Henry the Eighth:</p>
            <p>"God's death! thou hussy, thou wanton! thou gill-flirt! thou flaunting young
               cockatrice! is our court and presence to be contaminated and insulted by such doings
               as these? Begone! and let me never again see thy shameless face: what! did I send
               this traitorous and temerarious youth to Ireland to collect carcanets for his
               concubines, instead of putting chains around the rebel Tyrone. By the throne of
               heaven! he shall dearly rue it. I am no Queen to be thus saucily entreated."</p>
            <p>The terrified maid of honor shrunk away to conceal her disgrace; Elizabeth arose and
               walked hastily towards the mansion, but having had a few minutes to collect herself,
               and feeling probably that she had betrayed rather more violence than became her sex
               and station, she turned towards her attendants, and <pb n="311" xml:id="image368"/>in
               a tone of assumed moderation exclaimed, "For ourself, ladies, this matter touches us
               not; the disloyal minion and the frontless minx would have been forgotten in silent
               scorn, but that we will neither suffer our public service to be neglected, nor the
               decency of our court to be violated.</p>
            <p>"For the latter, let the name of this flirting puppet be scratched from the list of
               our maids; and touching this misproved and disobedient Lord Deputy, who has dared to
               desert his post, and return from Ireland in open defiance of our orders, we will see
               that he be straightway humbled; where is our secretary? let him join us forthwith in
               the council room.</p>
            <p>That same evening the Earl was committed a prisoner to his chamber, and after much
               delay and numerous vacillations, occasioned by the miserable perplexity of the
               Queen's mind, as she fluctuated between severity and returning tenderness, she at
               length publicly disgraced him, and deprived him of all his great offices and
               emoluments. Always haughty and ungovernable, and rendered alike desperate in fortune
               and in mind by these indignities, the ill-fated Earl was driven to those frantic and
               well known projects of rebellion which shortly afterwards conducted him to the
               scaffold.</p>
