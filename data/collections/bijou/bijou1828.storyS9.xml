            <p>"IT grieves me," said an eminent poet once to me, "it grieves and humbles me to
               reflect how much our moral nature is in the power of circumstances. Our best
               faculties would remain unknown even to ourselves did not the influences of external
               excitement call them forth like animalcul√¶, which lie torpid till wakened into life
               by the transient sunbeam."</p>
            <p>This is generally true. How many walk through the beaten paths of every day life, who
               but for the novelist's page would never weep or wonder; and who would know nothing of
               the passions but as they are represented in some tragedy or stage piece? not that
               they are incapable of high resolve and energy; but because the finer qualities have
               never been called forth by imperious circumstances; for while the wheels of existence
               roll smoothly along, the soul will continue to slumber in her vehicle like a lazy
               traveller. <pb n="206" xml:id="image249"/>But for the French revolution, how many
               hundreds ‚Äî <emph>thousands</emph>thousands ‚Äî whose courage, fortitude and devotedness
               have sanctified their names, would have frittered away a frivolous, useless, or
               vicious life in the saloons of Paris! We have heard of death in its most revolting
               forms braved by delicate females, who would have screamed at the sight of the most
               insignificant reptile or insect; and men cheerfully toiling at mechanic trades for
               bread who had lounged away the best years of their lives at the toilettes of their
               mistresses. We know not of what we are capable till the trial comes; ‚Äî till it comes,
               perhaps, in a form which makes the strong man quail, and turns the gentler woman into
               a heroine.</p>
            <p>The power of outward circumstances suddenly to awaken dormant faculties ‚Äî the
               extraordinary influence which the mere instinct of self-preservation can exert over
               the <emph>mind</emph>, and the triumph of mind thus excited over physical weakness,
               were never more truly exemplified than in the story of HALLORAN THE PEDLAR.</p>
            <p>The real circumstances of this singular case, differing essentially from the garbled
               and incorrect account which appeared in the newspapers some years ago, came to my
               knowledge in the following simple manner. My cousin George C * * *, an Irish
               barrister of some standing, lately succeeded to his family estates by the death of a
               near relative; and no sooner<pb n="207" xml:id="image250"/>did he find himself in
               possession of independence than, abjuring the bar, where, after twenty years of hard
               struggling, he was just beginning to make a figure, he set off on a tour through
               Italy and Greece, to forget the wrangling of courts, the contumely of attornies, and
               the impatience of clients. He left in my hands a mass of papers, to burn or not, as I
               might feel inclined: and truly the contents of his desk were no bad illustration of
               the character and pursuits of its owner. Here I found abstracts of cases, and on
               their backs copies of verses, sketches of scenery, and numerous caricatures of
               judges, jurymen, witnesses, and his brethren of the bar ‚Äî a bundle of old briefs, and
               the beginnings of two tragedies; with a long list of Lord N ‚Äî ‚Äî 's best jokes to
               serve his purposes as occasion might best offer. Among these heterogeneous and
               confused articles were a number of scraps carefully pinned together, containing notes
               on a certain trial, the first in which he had been retained as counsel for the crown.
               The intense interest with which I perused these documents, suggested the plan of
               throwing the whole into a connected form, and here it is for the reader's
               benefit..</p>
            <p>In the south part of the country of Kilkenny lived a poor peasant named Michael, or,
               as it was elegantly pronounced Mickle Reilly. He was a labourer renting a cabin and a
               little potatoe-ground; and <pb n="208" xml:id="image251"/>on the strength of these
               possessions, a robust frame which feared no fatigue, and a sanguine mind which
               dreaded no reverse, Reilly paid his addresses to Cathleen Bray, a young girl of his
               own parish, and they were married. Reilly was able, skilful, and industrious;
               Cathleen was the best spinner in the county, and had constant sale for her work at
               Kilkenny: they wanted nothing; and for the first year, as Cathleen said, "There
               wasn't upon the blessed earth two happier souls than themselves, for Mick was the
               best boy in the world, and hadn't a fault to <emph>spake</emph> of ‚Äî barring he took
               the drop now and then; an' why wouldn't he?" But as it happened, poor Reilly's love
               of "<emph>the drop</emph>" was the beginning of all their misfortunes. In an evil
               hour he went to the Fair of Kilkenny to sell a dozen hanks of yarn of his wife's
               spinning, and a fat pig, the produce of which was to pay half a year's rent, and add
               to their little comforts. Here he met with a jovial companion, who took him into a
               booth, and treated him to sundry potations of whiskey; and while in his company, his
               pocket was picked of the money he had just received, and something more; in short, of
               all he possessed in the world. At that luckless moment, while maddened by his loss
               and heated with liquor, he fell into the company of a recruiting serjeant [sic]. The
               many-colored and gaily fluttering cockade in the soldier's cap shone like a rainbow
               of hope and promise before the <pb n="209" xml:id="image252"/>drunken eyes of Mickle
               Reilly, and ere morning he was enlisted into a regiment under orders for embarkation,
               and instantly sent off to Cork.</p>
            <p>Distracted by the ruin he had brought upon himself, and his wife (whom he loved a
               thousand times better than himself) poor Reilly sent a friend to inform Cathleen of
               his mischance, and to assure her that on a certain day, in a week from that time, a
               letter would await her at the Kilkenny post-office: the same friend was commissioned
               to deliver her his silver watch, and a guinea out of his bounty-money. Poor Cathleen
               turned from the gold with horror, as the price of her husband's blood, and vowed that
               nothing on earth should induce her to touch it. She was not a good calculator of time
               and distance, and therefore rather surprised that so long a time must elapse before
               his letter arrived. On the appointed day she was too impatient to wait the arrival of
               the carrier, but set off to Kilkenny herself, a distance of ten miles: there, at the
               post-office, she duly found the promised letter; but it was not till she had it in
               her possession that she remembered she could not read: she had therefore to hasten
               back to consult her friend Nancy, the schoolmaster's daughter, and the best scholar
               in the village. Reilly's letter, on being deciphered with some difficulty even by the
               learned Nancy, was found to contain much of sorrow, much of repentance, and yet more
                  <pb n="210" xml:id="image253"/>of affection: he assured her that he was far better
               off than he had expected or deserved; that the embarkation of the regiment to which
               he belonged was delayed for three weeks, and entreated her, if she could forgive him,
               to follow him to Cork without delay, that they might "part in love and kindness, and
               then come what might, he would demane himself like a man, and die asy," which he
               assured her he could not do without embracing her once more.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened to her husband's letter with clasped hands and drawn breath, but
               quiet in her nature, she gave no other signs of emotion than a few large tears which
               trickled slowly down her cheeks. "And will I see him again?" she exclaimed, "poor
               fellow! poor boy! I knew the heart of him was sore for me! and who knows Nance dear,
               but they'll let me go out with him to the foreign parts! Oh! sure they wouldn't be so
               hard-hearted as to part man and wife that way!"</p>
            <p>After a hurried consultation with her neighbours, who sympathised with her as only
               the poor sympathise with the poor, a letter was indited [sic] by Nancy and sent by
               the Kilkenny carrier that night, to inform her husband that she purposed setting off
               for Cork the next blessed morning, being Tuesday, and as the distance was about
               forty-eight miles English, she reckoned on reaching that city by Wednesday afternoon;
               for as she had walked to Kil-<pb n="211" xml:id="image254"/>kenny and back (about
               twenty miles) that same day, without feeling fatigued at all, "<emph>to
                  signify</emph>," Cathleen thought there would be no doubt that she could walk to
               Cork in less than two days. In this sanguine calculation she was however over-ruled
               by her more experienced neighbours, and by their advice appointed Thursday as the day
               on which her husband was to expect her, "God willing."</p>
            <p>Cathleen spent the rest of the day in making preparations for her journey: she set
               her cabin in order, and made a small bundle of a few articles of clothing belonging
               to herself and her husband. The watch and the guinea she wrapped up together and
               crammed into the toe of an old shoe which she deposited in the said bundle, and the
               next morning, at "sparrow chirp," she arose, locked her cabin door, carefully hid the
               key in the thatch, and with a light expecting heart commenced her long journey.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of remark that this poor woman who was called upon to play the heroine
               in such a strange tragedy and under such appalling circumstances, had nothing heroic
               in her exterior: nothing that in the slightest degree indicated strength of nerve or
               superiority of intellect. Cathleen was twenty-three years of age, of a low stature,
               and in her form rather delicate than robust: she was of ordinary appearance; her eyes
               mild and dove-<pb n="212" xml:id="image255"/>like, and her whole countenance, though
               not absolutely deficient in intelligence, was more particularly expressive of
               simplicity, good temper and kindness of heart.</p>
            <p>It was summer, about the end of June: the days were long, the weather fine, and some
               gentle showers rendered travelling easy and pleasant. Cathleen walked on stoutly
               towards Cork, and by the evening she had accomplished with occasional pauses of rest,
               nearly twenty-one miles. She lodged at a little inn by the road side, and the
               following day set forward again, but soon felt stiff with the travel of two previous
               days: the sun became hotter, the ways dustier; and she could not with all her
               endeavours get farther than Kathery, eighteen miles from Cork. The next day
               unfortunately for poor Cathleen, proved hotter and more fatiguing than the preceding.
               The cross road lay over a wild country, consisting of low bogs and bare hills. About
               noon she turned aside to a rivulet bordered by a few trees, and sitting down in the
               shade, she bathed her swollen feet in the stream and overcome by heat, weakness, and
               excessive weariness she put her little bundle under her head for a pillow and sunk
               into a deep sleep.</p>
            <p>On waking she perceived with dismay that the sun was declining: and on looking about,
               her fears were increased by the discovery that her bundle was gone. Her first thought
               was that the good people, (i.e. <pb n="213" xml:id="image256"/>
               <emph>the fairies</emph>) had been there and stolen it away; but on examining farther
               she plainly perceived large foot-prints in the soft bank and was convinced it was the
               work of no unearthly marauder. Bitterly reproaching herself for her carelessness, she
               again set forward; and still hoping to reach Cork that night, she toiled on and on
               with increasing difficulty and distress, till as the evening closed her spirits
               failed, she became faint, foot-sore and hungry, not having tasted any thing since the
               morning but a cold potatoe and a draught of buttermilk. She then looked round her in
               hopes of discovering some habitation, but there was none in sight except a lofty
               castle on a distant hill, which raising its proud turrets from amidst the plantation
               which surrounded it, glimmered faintly through the gathering gloom, and held out no
               temptation for the poor wanderer to turn in there and rest. In her despair she sat
               down on a bank by the road side, and wept as she thought of her husband.</p>
            <p>Several horsemen rode by, and one carriage and four attended by servants, who took no
               farther notice of her than by a passing look; while they went on their way like the
               priest and the Levite in the parable, poor Cathleen dropped her head despairingly on
               her bosom. A faintness and torpor seemed to be stealing like a dark cloud over her
               senses, when the fast approaching sound of footsteps roused her attention, and
               turning, she saw at her side a man <pb n="214" xml:id="image257"/>whose figure though
               singular, she recognised immediately: it was Halloran the Pedlar.</p>
            <p>Halloran had been known for thirty years past in all the towns and villages between
               Waterford and Kerry. He was very old, he himself did not know his own age; he only
               remembered that he was a "tall slip of a boy" when he was one of the ‚Äî ‚Äî regiment of
               foot, and fought in America in 1778. His dress was strange, it consisted of a woollen
               cap, beneath which strayed a few white hairs, this was surmounted by an old military
               cocked hat, adorned with a few fragments of tarnished gold lace: a frieze great coat
               with the sleeves dangling behind, was fastened at his throat, and served to protect
               his box of wares which was slung at his back; and he always carried a thick oak stick
               or <emph>kippeen</emph> in his hand. There was nothing of the infirmity of age in his
               appearance: his cheek though wrinkled and weather-beaten was still ruddy: his step
               still firm, his eyes still bright; his jovial disposition made him a welcome guest in
               every cottage, and his jokes, though not equal to my Lord Norbury's, were repeated
               and applauded through the whole country. Halloran was lreturning [sic] from the fair
               of Kilkenny, where apparently his commercial speculations had been attended with
               success, as his pack was considerably diminished in size. Though he did not appear to
               recollect Cathleen, he addressed her in Irish, and asked her what <pb n="215" xml:id="image258"/>she did there: she related in a few words her miserable
               situation.</p>
            <p>"In troth, then, my heart is sorry for ye, poor woman," he replied, compassionately;
               "and what will ye do?"</p>
            <p>"An' what can I do?" replied Cathleen, disconsolately; "and how will I even find the
               ford of Ahnamoe and get across to Cork, when I don't know where I am this blessed
               moment?"</p>
            <p> "Musha, then, its little ye'll get there this night," said the pedlar, shaking his
               head.</p>
            <p>"Then I'll lie down here and die," said Cathleen, bursting into fresh tears.</p>
            <p>"Die! ye wouldn't!" he exclaimed, approaching nearer; "is it to me, Peter Halloran,
               ye spake that word; and am I the man that would lave a faymale at this dark hour by
               the way side, let alone one that has the face of a friend, though I cannot remember
               me of your name either, for the soul of me. But what matter for that?"</p>
            <p>"Sure, I'm Katty Reilly, of Castle Conn."</p>
            <p>"Katty Reilly, sure enough! and so no more talk of dying; cheer up, and see, a mile
               farther on, isn't there Biddy Hogan's? <emph>Was</emph>, I mane, if the house and all
               isn't gone: and its there we'll get a bite and a sup, and a bed, too, please God. So
               lean upon my arm, ma vourneen, its strong enough yet."</p>
            <pb n="216" xml:id="image259"/>
            <p>So saying, the old man with an air of gallantry, half rustic, half military, assisted
               her in rising; and upporting [sic] her on one arm, with the other he flourished his
               kippeen over his head, and they trudged on together, he singing Cruiskeen lawn at the
               top of his voice, "just," as he said, "to put the heart into her."</p>
            <p>After about half an hour's walking, they came to two crossways, diverging from the
               high road: down one of these the Pedlar turned, and in a few minutes they came in
               sight of a lonely house, situated at a little distance from the way-side. Above the
               door was a long stick projecting from the wall, at the end of which dangled a truss
               of straw, signifying that within there was entertainment (good or bad) for man and
               beast. By this time it was nearly dark, and the pedlar going up to the door, lifted
               the latch, expecting it to yield to his hand; but it was fastened within: he then
               knocked and called, but there was no answer. The building which was many times larger
               than an ordinary cabin had once been a manufactory, and afterwards a farm-house. One
               end of it was deserted, and nearly in ruins; the other end bore signs of having been
               at least recently inhabited. But such a dull hollow echo rung through the edifice at
               every knock, that it seemed the whole place was now deserted.</p>
            <p>Cathleen began to be alarmed, and crossed her-<pb n="217" xml:id="image260"/>self,
               ejaculating, "O God preserve us!" But the Pedlar, who appeared well acquainted with
               the premises, led her round to the back part of the house, where there were some
               ruined out-buildings, and another low entrance. Here, raising his stout stick, he let
               fall such a heavy thump on the door that it cracked again; and a shrill voice from
               the other side demanded who was there? After a satisfactory answer, the door was
               slowly and cautiously opened, and the figure of a wrinkled, half famished and half
               naked beldam appeared, shading a rush candle with one hand. Halloran, who was of a
               fiery and hasty temper, began angrily: "Why, then, in the name of the great devil
               himself, didn't you open to us?" But he stopped suddenly, as if struck with surprise
               at the miserable object before him.</p>
            <p>"Is it Biddy Hogan herself, I see!" he exclaimed, snatching the candle from her hand,
               and throwing the light full on her face. A moment's scrutiny seemed enough, and too
               much; for, giving it back hastily, he supported Cathleen into the kitchen, the old
               woman leading the way, and placed her on an old settle, the first seat which
               presented itself. When she was sufficiently recovered to look about her, Cathleen
               could not help feeling some alarm at finding herself in so gloomy and dreary a place.
               It had once been a large kitchen, or hall: at one <pb n="218" xml:id="image261"/>end
               was an ample chimney, such as are yet to be seen in some old country houses. The
               rafters were black with smoke or rottenness: the walls had been wainscoted with oak,
               but the greatest part had been torn down for firing. A table with three legs, a large
               stool, a bench in the chimney propped up with turf sods, and the seat Cathleen
               occupied, formed the only furniture. Every thing spoke of utter misery, filth, and
               famine ‚Äî the very "abomination of desolation."</p>
            <p>"And what have ye in the house, Biddy, honey?" was the Pedlar's first question, as
               the old woman set down the light.</p>
            <p>"Little enough, I'm thinking."</p>
            <p>"Little! Its nothing then."</p>
            <p>"No, not so much as a midge would eat have I in the house this blessed night, and
               nobody to send down to Balgowna."</p>
            <p>"No need of that, as our good luck would have it," said Halloran, and pulling a
               wallet from under his loose coat, he drew from it a bone of cold meat, a piece of
               bacon, a lump of bread, and some cold potatoes. The old woman, roused by the sight of
               so much good cheer, began to blow up the dying embers on the hearth; put down among
               them the few potatoes to warm, and busied herself in making some little preparations
               to entertain her guests. Meantime the old Pedlar, casting from time to time an
               anxious <pb n="219" xml:id="image262"/>glance towards Cathleen, and now and then an
               encouraging word, sat down on the low stool, resting his arms on his knees.</p>
            <p>"Times are sadly changed with ye, Biddy Hogan," said he at length, after a long
               silence.</p>
            <p>"Troth, ye may say so;" she replied with a sort of groan. "Bitter bad luck have we
               had in this world, any how."</p>
            <p>"And where's the man of the house? And where's the lad, Barny?"</p>
            <p>"Where are they, is it? Where should they be? may be gone down to Ahnamoe."</p>
            <p>"But what's come of Barny? The boy was a stout workman, and a good son, though a
               devil-may-care fellow, too. I remember teaching him the soldier's exercise with this
               very blessed stick now in my hand; and by the same token, him doubling his fist at me
               when he wasn't bigger than the turf-kish yonder; aye, and as long as Barney Hogan
               could turn a sod of turf on my lord's land, I thought his father and mother would
               never have wanted the bit and sup while the life was in him."</p>
            <p>At the mention of her son, the old woman looked up a moment, but immediately hung her
               head again.</p>
            <p>"Barny doesn't work for my lord now," said she.</p>
            <p>"And what for, then?"</p>
            <p>The old woman seemed reluctant to answer ‚Äî she hesitated.</p>
            <pb n="220" xml:id="image263"/>
            <p>"Ye didn't hear, then, how he got into trouble with my lord; and how ‚Äî myself doesn't
               know the rights of it ‚Äî but Barny had always a bit of wild blood about him; and since
               that day he's taken to bad ways, and the ould [sic] man's ruled by him quite
               entirely; and the one's glum and fierce like ‚Äî and t'other's bothered; and, oh!
               bitter's the time I have twixt 'em both!"</p>
            <p>While the old woman was uttering these broken complaints, she placed the eatables on
               the table; and Cathleen, who was yet more faint from hunger than subdued by fatigue,
               was first helped by the good-natured Pedlar to the best of what was there: but, just
               as she was about to taste the food set before her, she chanced to see the eyes of the
               old woman fixed upon the morsel in her hand with such an envious and famished look,
               that from a sudden impulse of benevolent feeling, she instantly held it out to her.
               The woman started, drew back her extended hand, and gazed at her wildly.</p>
            <p>"What is it then ails ye?" said Cathleen, looking at her with wonder; then to
               herself, "hunger's turned the wits of her, poor soul! Take it ‚Äî take it, mother,"
               added she aloud: "eat, good mother; sure there's plenty for us all, and to spare,"
               and she pressed it upon her with all the kindness of her nature. The old woman
               eagerly seized it.</p>
            <p>"God reward ye," said she, grasping Cathleen's <pb n="221" xml:id="image264"/>hand,
               convulsively, and retiring to a corner, she devoured the food with almost wolfish
               voracity.</p>
            <p>While they were eating, the two Hogans, father and son, came in. They had been
               setting snares for rabbits and game on the neighbouring hills; and evidently were
               both startled and displeased to find the house occupied; which, since Barny Hogan's
               disgrace with "my lord," had been entirely shunned by the people round about. The old
               man gave the pedlar a sulky welcome. The son, with a muttered curse, went and took
               his seat in the chimney, where, turning his back, he set himself to chop a billet of
               wood. The father was a lean stooping figure, "bony, and gaunt, and grim:" he was
               either deaf, or affected deafness. The son was a short, brawny, thickset man, with
               features not naturally ugly, but rendered worse than ugly by an expression of louring
               ferocity disgustingly blended with a sort of stupid drunken leer, the effect of
               habitual intoxication.</p>
            <p>Halloran stared at them awhile with visible astonishment and indignation, but pity
               and sorrow for a change so lamentable, smothered the old man's wrath; and as the
               eatables were by this time demolished, he took from his side pocket a tin flask of
               whiskey, calling to the old woman to boil some water "screeching hot," that he might
               make what he termed "a jug of stiff punch ‚Äî enough to make a cat spake." He offered
               to share it with his hosts, who did not decline drinking; <pb n="222" xml:id="image265"/>and the noggin went round to all but Cathleen, who, feverish
               with travelling, and, besides, disliking spirits, would not taste it. The old Pedlar,
               reconciled to his old acquaintances by this shew of good fellowship, began to grow
               merry under the influence of his whiskey-punch: he boasted of his late success in
               trade, shewed with exultation his almost empty pack, and taking out the only two
               handkerchiefs left in it, threw one to Cathleen, and the other to the old woman of
               the house; then slapping his pocket in which a quantity of loose money was heard to
               jingle, he swore he would treat Cathleen to a good breakfast next morning; and threw
               a shilling on the table, desiring the old woman would provide "stirabout for a
               dozen," and have it ready by the first light.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened to this rhodomontade in some alarm; she fancied to detect certain
               suspicious glances between the father and son, and began to feel an indescribable
               dread of her company. She arose from the table, urging the Pedlar good-humouredly to
               retire to rest, as they intended to be up and away so early next morning: then
               concealing her apprehensions under an affectation of extreme fatigue and drowsiness,
               she desired to be shewn where she would sleep. The old woman lighted a lanthorn, and
               led the way up some broken steps into a sort of loft, where she shewed her two beds
               standing close together; one of these <pb n="223" xml:id="image266"/>she intimated
               was for the Pedlar, and the other for herself. Now Cathleen had been born and bred in
               an Irish cabin, where the inmates are usually lodged after a very promiscuous
               fashion; our readers, therefore, will not wonder at the arrangement. Cathleen,
               however, required that, if possible some kind of skreen [sic] should be placed
               between the beds. The old hag at first replied to this request with the most
               disgusting impudence; but Cathleen insisting, the beds were moved asunder, leaving a
               space of about two feet between them; and after a long search a piece of old frieze
               was dragged out from among some rubbish, and hung up to the low rafters, so as to
               form a curtain or partition half way across the room. Having completed this
               arrangement, and wished her "a sweet sleep and a sound, and lucky dreams," the old
               woman put the lanthorn on the floor, for there was neither chair nor table, and left
               her guest to repose.</p>
            <p>Catheleen said her prayers, only partly undressed herself, and lifting up the worn
               out coverlet, lay down upon the bed. In a quarter of an hour afterwards the Pedlar
               staggered into the room, and as he passed the foot of her bed, bid God bless her, in
               a low voice. He then threw himself down on his bed, and in a few minutes, as she
               judged by his hard and equal breathing, the old man was in a deep sleep.</p>
            <p>All was now still in the house, but Cathleen <pb n="224" xml:id="image267"/>could not
               sleep. She was feverish and restless: her limbs ached, her head throbbed and burned,
               undefinable fears beset her fancy; and whenever she tried to compose herself to
               slumber the faces of the two men she had left below flitted and glared before her
               eyes. A sense of heat and suffocation, accompanied by a parching thirst, came over
               her, caused, perhaps, by the unusual closeness of the room. This feeling of
               oppression increased till the very walls and rafters seemed to approach nearer and
               close upon her all around. Unable any longer to endure this intolerable smothering
               sensation, she was just about to rise and open the door or window, when she heard the
               whispering of voices. She lay still and listened. The latch was raised cautiously, ‚Äî
               the door opened, and the two Hogans entered: they trod so softly that, though she saw
               them move before her, she heard no foot-fall. They approached the bed of Halloran,
               and presently she heard a dull heavy blow, and then sounds ‚Äî appalling sickening
               sounds ‚Äî as of subdued struggles and smothered agony, which convinced her that they
               were murdering the unfortunate Pedlar.</p>
            <p>Cathleen listened, almost congealed with horror, but she did not swoon: her turn, she
               thought, must come next, though in the same instant she felt instinctively that her
               only chance of preservation was to counterfeit profound sleep. The murderers, <pb n="225" xml:id="image268"/>having done their work on the poor Pedlar, approached
               her bed, and threw the gleam of their lanthorn full on her face; she lay quite still,
               breathing calmly and regularly. They brought the light to her eye-lids, but they did
               not wink or move; ‚Äî there was a pause, a terrible pause, and then a whispering; ‚Äî and
               presently Cathleen thought she could distinguish a third voice, as of expostulation,
               but all in so very low a tone that though the voices were close to her she could not
               hear a word that was uttered. After some moments, which appeared an age of agonising
               suspense, the wretches withdrew, and Cathleen was left alone, and in darkness. Then,
               indeed, she felt as one ready to die: to use her own affecting language, "the heart
               within me," said she, "melted away like water, but I was resolute not to swoon, and I
                  <emph>did not</emph>. I knew that if I would preserve my life, I must keep the
               sense in me, and <emph>I did</emph>."</p>
            <p>Now and then she fancied she heard the murdered man move, and creep about in his bed,
               and this horrible conceit almost maddened her with terror: but she set herself to
               listen fixedly, and convinced her reason that all was still ‚Äî that all was over.</p>
            <p>She then turned her thoughts to the possibility of escape. The window first suggested
               itself: the faint moon-light was just struggling through the dirty and cob-webbed
               panes: it was very small, and Cathleen reflected, that besides the difficulty, and,
                  <pb n="226" xml:id="image269"/>perhaps, impossibility of getting through, it must
               be some height from the ground: neither could she tell on which side of the house it
               was situated, nor in what direction to turn, supposing she reached the ground; and,
               above all, she was aware that the slightest noise, must cause her instant
               destruction. She thus resolved upon remaining quiet.</p>
            <p>It was most fortunate that Cathleen came to this determination, for without the
               slightest previous sound the door again opened, and in the faint light, to which her
               eyes were now accustomed, she saw the head of the old woman bent forward in a
               listening attitude: in a few minutes the door closed, and then followed a whispering
               outside. She could not at first distinguish a word until the woman's sharper tones
               broke out, though in a suppressed vehemence, with "If ye touch her life, Barny, a
               mother's curse go with ye! enough's done."</p>
            <p>"She'll live, then, to hang us all," said the miscreant son.</p>
            <p>"Sooner than that, I'd draw this knife across her throat with my own hands; and I'd
               do it again and again, sooner than they should touch your life, Barny, jewel: but no
               fear, the creature's asleep or dead already, with the fright of it."</p>
            <p>The son then said something which Cathleen could not hear; the old woman replied,</p>
            <p>"Hisht! I tell ye, no, ‚Äî no; the ship's now in the <pb n="227" xml:id="image270"/>Cove of Cork that's to carry her over the salt seas far enough out of the way: and
               haven't we all she has in the world? and more, didn't she take the bit out of her own
               mouth to put into mine?"</p>
            <p>The son again spoke inaudibly; and then the voices ceased, leaving Cathleen uncertain
               as to her fate.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the door opened, and the father and son again entered, and carried out
               the body of the wretched Pedlar. They seemed to have the art of treading without
               noise, for though Cathleen saw them move, she could not hear a sound of a footstep.
               The old woman was all this time standing by her bed, and every now and then casting
               the light full upon her eyes; but as she remained quiet still, and apparently in a
               deep calm sleep, they left her undisturbed, and she neither saw nor heard any more of
               them that night.</p>
            <p>It ended at length ‚Äî that long, long night of horror. Cathleen lay quiet till she
               thought the morning sufficiently advanced. She then rose, and went down into the
               kitchen: the old woman was lifting a pot off the fire, and nearly let it fall as
               Cathleen suddenly addressed her, and with an appearance of surprise and concern,
               asked for her friend the Pedlar, saying she had just looked into his bed, supposing
               he was still asleep, and to her great amazement had found it empty. The old woman
               replied, that he had set out at <pb n="228" xml:id="image271"/>early day-light for
               Mallow, having only just remembered that his business called him that way before he
               went to Cork. Cathleen affected great wonder and perplexity, and reminded the woman
               that he had promised to pay for her breakfast.</p>
            <p>"An' so he did, sure enough," she replied, "and paid for it too; and by the same
               token didn't I go down to Balgowna myself for the milk and the <emph>male</emph>
               before the sun was over the tree tops; and here it is for ye, ma colleen [sic]:" so
               saying, she placed a bowl of stirabout and some milk before Cathleen, and then sat
               down on the stool opposite her, watching her intently.</p>
            <p>Poor Cathleen! she had but little inclination to eat, and felt as if every bit would
               choke her: yet she continued to force down her breakfast, and apparently with the
               utmost ease and appetite, even to the last morsel set before her. While eating, she
               enquired about the husband and son, and the old woman replied, that they had started
               at the first burst of light to cut turn in a bog, about five miles distant.</p>
            <p>When Cathleen had finished her breakfast, she returned the old woman many thanks for
               her kind treatment, and then desired to know the nearest way to Cork. The woman Hogan
               informed her that the distance was about seven miles, and though the usual road was
               by the high way from which they had <pb n="229" xml:id="image272"/>turned the
               preceding evening, there was a much shorter way across some fields which she pointed
               out: Cathleen listened attentively to her directions, and then bidding farewell with
               many demonstrations of gratitude, she proceeded on her fearful journey. The cool
               morning air, the cheerful song of the early birds, the dewy freshness of the turf,
               were all unnoticed and unfelt: the sense of danger was paramount, while her faculties
               were all alive and awake to meet it, for a feverish and unnatural strength seemed to
               animate her limbs. She stepped on, shortly debating with herself whether to follow
               the directions given by the old woman. The high road appeared the safest; on the
               other hand, she was aware that the slightest betrayal of mistrust would perhaps be
               followed by her destruction; and thus rendered brave even by the excess of her fears,
               she determined to take the cross path. Just as she had come to this resolution, she
               reached the gate which she had been directed to pass through; and without the
               slightest apparent hesitation, she turned in, and pursued the lonely way through the
               fields. Often did she fancy she heard footsteps stealthily following her, and never
               approached a hedge without expecting to see the murderers start up from behind it;
               yet she never once turned her head, nor quickened nor slackened her pace; </p>
            <pb n="230" xml:id="image273"/>
            <lg type="stanza" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
               <l rend="indent5" part="N">Like one that on a lonesome road</l>
               <l rend="indent5" part="N">Doth walk in fear and dread,</l>
               <l rend="indent5" part="N">Because he knows a frightful fiend</l>
               <l rend="indent5" part="N">Doth close behind him tread.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>She had proceeded in this manner about three quarters of a mile, and approached a
               thick and dark grove of underwood, when she beheld seated upon the opposite stile an
               old woman in a red cloak. The sight of a human being made her heart throb more
               quickly for a moment; but on approaching nearer, with all her faculties sharpened by
               the sense of danger, she perceived that it was no old woman, but the younger Hogan,
               the murderer of Halloran, who was thus disguised. His face was partly concealed by a
               blue handkerchief tied round his head and under his chin, but she knew him by the
               peculiar and hideous expression of his eyes: yet with amazing and almost incredible
               self-possession, she continued to advance without manifesting the least alarm, or
               sign of recognition; and walking up to the pretended old woman, said in a clear
               voice, "The blessing of the morning on ye, good mother! a fine day for travelers like
               you and me!"</p>
            <p>"A fine day," he replied, coughing and mumbling in a feigned voice, "but ye see,
               hugh, ugh! ye see I've walked this mornin' from the Cove of Cork, jewel, and troth
               I'm almost spent, and I've a bad <pb n="231" xml:id="image274"/>cowld, and a cough on
               me, as you may her," and he coughed vehemently. Cathleen made a motion to pass the
               stile, but the disguised old woman stretching out a great bony hand, seized her gown.
               Still Cathleen did not quail. "Musha, then, have ye nothing to give a poor old
               woman," said the monster, in a whining, snuffling tone. "Nothing have I in this wide
               world," said Cathleen, quietly disengaging her gown, but without moving. "Sure its
               only yesterday I was robbed of all I had but the little clothes on my back, and if I
               hadn't met with charity from others I'd have starved by the way side by this
               time."</p>
            <p>"Och! and is there no place hereby where they would give a potatoe and a cup of cowld
               water to a poor old woman ready to drop on her road?"</p>
            <p>Cathleen instantly pointed forward to the house she had just left, and recommended
               her to apply there. "Sure they're good, honest people, though poor enough, God help
               them," she continued, "and I wish ye mother, no worse luck than myself had, and
               that's a good friend to treat ye to a supper, aye, and a breakfast too; there it is,
               ye may just see the light smoke rising like a thread over the hill, just fornent ye;
               and so God speed ye!"</p>
            <p>Cathleen turned to descend the stile as she spoke expecting to be again seized with a
               strong and murderous grasp; but her enemy, secure in his disguise, <pb n="232" xml:id="image275"/>and never doubting her perfect unconsciousness, suffered her to
               pass unmolested.</p>
            <p>Another half mile brought her to the top of a rising ground, within sight of the high
               road; she could see crowds of people on horseback and on foot, with cars and
               carriages passing along in one direction; for it was, though Cathleen did not then
               know it, the first day of the Cork Assizes. As she gazed, she wished for the wings of
               a bird that she might in a moment flee over the space which intervened between her
               and safety; for though she could clearly see the high road from the hill on which she
               stood, a valley of broken ground at its foot, and two wide fields still separated her
               from it; but with the same unfailing spirit, and at the same steady pace, she
               proceeded onwards: and now she had reached the middle of the last field, and a thrill
               of new born hope was beginning to flutter at her heart, when suddenly two men burst
               through the fence at the farther side of the field, and advanced towards her. One of
               these she thought at the first glance resembled her husband, but that it was her
               husband himself was an idea which never entered her mind. Her imagination was
               possessed with the one supreme idea of danger and death by murderous hands; she
               doubted not that these were the two Hogans in some new disguise, and silently
               recommending herself to God, <pb n="233" xml:id="image276"/>she steeled her heart to
               meet this fresh trial of her fortitude; aware, that however it might end, it
                  <emph>must</emph> be the last. At this moment one of the men throwing up his arms,
               ran forward, shouting her name, in a voice ‚Äî a dear and well known voice, in which
               she <emph>could</emph> not be deceived: ‚Äî it was her husband!</p>
            <p>The poor woman, who had hitherto supported her spirits and her self-possession, stood
               as if rooted to the ground, weak, motionless, and gasping for breath. A cold dew
               burst from every pore; her ears tingled, her heart fluttered as though it would burst
               from her bosom. When she attempted to call out, and raise her hand in token of
               recognition, the sounds died away, rattling in her throat; her arm dropped powerless
               at her side; and when her husband came up, and she made a last effort to spring
               towards him, she sank down at his feet in strong convulsions.</p>
            <p>Reilly, much shocked at what he supposed the effect of sudden surprise, knelt down
               and chafed his wife's temples; his comrade ran to a neighbouring spring for water,
               which they sprinkled plentifully over her: when, however, she returned to life, her
               intellects appeared to have fled for ever, and she uttered such wild shrieks and
               exclamations, and talked so incoherently, that the men became exceedingly terrified,
               and poor Reilly himself, almost as distracted as his wife. After vainly attempting to
               soothe and recover her, they at length forcibly carried her <pb n="234" xml:id="image277"/>down to the inn at Balgowna, a hamlet about a mile farther on,
               where she remained for several hours in a state of delirium, one fit succeeding
               another with little intermission.</p>
            <p>Towards evening she became more composed, and was able to give some account of the
               horrible events of the preceding night. It happened, opportunely, that a gentleman of
               fortune in the neighbourhood, and a magistrate, was riding by late that evening on
               his return from the Assizes at Cork, and stopped at the inn to refresh his horse.
               Hearing that something unusual and frightful had occurred, he alighted, and examined
               the woman himself, in the presence of one or two persons. Her tale appeared to him so
               strange and wild from the manner in which she told it, and her account of her own
               courage and sufferings so exceedingly incredible, that he was at first inclined to
               disbelieve the whole, and suspected the poor woman either of imposture or insanity.
               He did not, however, think proper totally to neglect her testimony, but immediately
               sent off information of the murder to Cork. Constables with a warrant were despatched
               [sic] the same night to the house of the Hogans, which they found empty, and the
               inmates already fled: but after a long search, the body of the wretched Halloran, and
               part of his property, were found concealed in a stack of old chimneys among the
               ruins; and this proof of <pb n="235" xml:id="image278"/> guilt was decisive. The
               country was instantly up; the most active search after the murderers was made by the
               police, assisted by all the neighbouring peasantry; and before twelve o'clock the
               following night, the three Hogans, father, mother, and son, had been apprehended in
               different places of concealment, and placed in safe custody. Meantime the Coroner's
               inquest having sat on the body, brought in a verdict of willful murder.</p>
            <p>As the Judges were then at Cork, the trial came on immediately; and from its
               extraordinary circumstances, excited the most intense and general interest. Among the
               property of poor Halloran discovered in the house, were a pair of shoes and a cap
               which Cathleen at once identified as belonging to herself, and Reilly's silver watch
               was found on the younger Hogan. When questioned how they came into his possession, he
               sullenly refused to answer. His mother eagerly, and as if to shield her son confessed
               that she was the person who had robbed Cathleen in the former part of the day, that
               she had gone out on the Carrick road to beg, having been left by her husband and son
               for two days without the means of support; and finding Cathleen asleep, she had taken
               away the bundle, supposing it to contain food; and did not recognise her as the same
               person she had robbed, till Cathleen offered her part of her supper.</p>
            <pb n="236" xml:id="image279"/>
            <p>The surgeon, who had been called to examine the body of Halloran, deposed to the
               cause of his death; ‚Äî that the old man had been first stunned by a heavy blow on the
               temple, and then strangled. Other witnesses deposed to the finding of the body: the
               previous character of the Hogans, and the circumstances attending their apprehension;
               but the principal witness was Cathleen. She appeared, leaning on her husband, her
               face was ashy pale, and her limbs too weak for support; yet she however, was
               perfectly collected, and gave her testimony with that precision, simplicity, and
               modesty, peculiar to her character. When she had occasion to allude to her own
               feelings, it was with such natural and heart-felt eloquence that the whole court was
               affected; and, when she described her recontre at the stile there was a general
               pressure and a breathless suspense; and then a loud murmur of astonishment and
               admiration fully participated by even the bench of magistrates. The evidence was
               clear and conclusive; and the jury, without retiring, gave their verdict, guilty ‚Äî
               Death.</p>
            <p>When the miserable wretches were asked, in the usual forms, if they had any thing to
               say why the awful sentence should not be passed upon them, the old man replied by a
               look of idiotic vacancy, and was mute ‚Äî the younger Hogan answered sullenly,
               "nothing:" the old woman staring wildly on her <pb n="237" xml:id="image280"/>son,
               tried to speak; her lips moved, but without a sound ‚Äî and she fell forward on the bar
               in strong fits.</p>
            <p>At this moment Cathleen rushed from the arms of her husband, and throwing herself on
               her knees, with clasped hands, and cheeks streaming with tears, begged for mercy for
               the old woman. "Mercy, my lord judge!" she exclaimed. "Gentlemen, your honours, have
               mercy on her. She had mercy on me! She only did their bidding. As for the bundle and
               all in it, I give it to her with all my soul, so it's no robbery. The grip of
               hunger's hard to bear; and if she hadn't taken it then, where would I have been now?
               Sure they would have killed me for the sake of the watch, and I would have been a
               corpse before your honours this moment. O mercy! mercy for her! or never will I sleep
               asy on this side of the grave!"</p>
            <p>The judge, though much affected, was obliged to have her forcibly carried from the
               court, and justice took its awful course. Sentence of death was pronounced on all the
               prisoners; but the woman was reprieved, and afterwards transported. The two men were
               executed within forty-eight hours after their conviction, on the Gallows Green. They
               made no public confession of their guilt, and met their fate with sullen
               indifference. The awful ceremony was for a moment interrupted by an incident with
                  after-<pb n="238" xml:id="image281"/>wards furnished ample matter for wonder and
               speculation among the superstitious populace. It was well known that the younger
               Hogan had been long employed on the estate of a nobleman in the neighbourhood; but
               having been concerned in the abduction of a young female, under circumstances of
               peculiar atrocity, which for the want of legal evidence could not be brought home to
               him, he was dismissed; and, finding himself an object of general execration, he had
               since been skulking about the country, associating with housebreakers and other
               lawless and abandoned characters. At the moment the hangman was adjusting the rope
               round his neck, a shrill voice screamed from the midst of the crowd, "Barny Hogan! do
               ye mind Grace Power, and the last words ever she spoke to ye?" there was a general
               movement and confusion; no one could or would tell whence the voice proceeded. The
               wretched man was seen to change countenance for the first time, and raising himself
               on tiptoe, gazed wildly round upon the multitude: but he said nothing; and in a few
               minutes he was no more.</p>
            <p>The reader may wish to know what has become of Cathleen, our <emph>heroine</emph>, in
               the true sense of the word. Her story, her sufferings, her extraordinary fortitude,
               and pure simplicity of character made her an object of general curiosity and
               interest: a subscription was raised for her, which soon amounted to a liberal sum;
               they were enabled to procure Reilly's discharge from <pb n="239" xml:id="image282"/>the army, and with a part of the money, Cathleen, who, among her other perfections,
               was exceedingly pious after the fashion of her creed and country, founded yearly
               masses for the soul of the poor Pedlar; and vowed herself to make a pilgrimage of
               thanksgiving to St. Gobnate's well. Mr. L. the magistrate who had first examined her
               in the little inn at Balgowna, made her a munificent present; and anxious, perhaps,
               to offer yet farther amends for his former doubts of her veracity, he invited Reilly
               on very advantageous terms, to settle on his estate, where he rented a neat cabin,
               and a <emph>handsome</emph> plot of potatoe ground. There Reilly and his Cathleen
               were living ten years ago, with an increasing family, and in the enjoyment of much
               humble happiness; and there, for aught I know to the contrary, they may be living at
               this day.</p>
