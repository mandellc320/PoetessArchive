            <p>"There is no faith in woman!" I exclaimed to myself the other morning, and I repeated
               it thrice with increasing emphasis.</p>
            <p>"There is no faith in woman. — And what woman has taught you to think so?" said a
               soft voice near me.</p>
            <p>I started, for I had most unconsciously been uttering my thoughts aloud, while
               leaning on the back of my cousin Agatha's couch, with my eyes resting on the sheet of
               music paper which lay before her. I coloured as her glance met mine.</p>
            <p>"Nay — is it not true?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Nay," she repeated — "I will not be answered by a nay! — cousin Henry."</p>
            <p>"But my dear cousin — my dear Agatha" — cried I, "you are a woman, and a beautiful
               woman — you can be no judge."</p>
            <pb n="243" xml:id="image298"/>
            <p>"And supposing I admit it," said Agatha, smiling, "what has my beauty to do with
               either my womanhood, or my judgment?"</p>
            <p>"There you may answer it yourself — what woman can judge of her sex's failings! —
               what beautiful woman can deal fairly by a sister beauty?"</p>
            <p>"Is this all?" replied she, "Then you have learned to libel us merely from the cant
               of the day!"</p>
            <p>"It is the cant of ages," said I.</p>
            <p>"Surely not! — the cant of the careless and the unmeaning — but not where there is a
               heart and head to think, and to feel — no, my dear cousin, do not repeat it. There is
               both trust and truth in woman."</p>
            <p>"Agatha," said I, "why have you never married?"</p>
            <p>"Harry," returned she, "why have you this ill opinion of our sex?"</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! But with your beauty, and your wit, and your fortune and consequence" — </p>
            <p>"Tell me — why do you quarrel with us?" — "Harry," continued my cousin, interrupting
               me with more earnestness, "we must not let our own individual disappointments disgust
               us with the world at large — search well, and we shall discover our injustice —
               besides, let us be content though we meet but one faithful heart amidst a crowd of
               treachery."</p>
            <p>"And how shall we find it? Where shall we meet with this faithful heart in woman? No,
               Agatha," <pb n="244" xml:id="image299"/>cried I, "you mistake the character of woman
               — you do not know her — you cannot know her — you, who must always be every way above
               the rest of your sex, and as different as inimitable!"</p>
            <p>She was silent, she was even grave for a moment or two, and the shade of thought in
               the expression of her bland and beautiful countenance seemed almost as if it grew
               into sadness. She looked at me with a smile, "Cousin," said she, "tell me your
               history? You have been unfortunate;" and she pointed with her small and snow white
               hand to the vacant seat beside her on the sofa.</p>
            <p>There was a gentleness, a delicacy, and a tenderness in my cousin Agatha's
               disposition which gave a charm to her slightest action. It was a gracefulness of
               character which seemed to have inspired the gracefulness of her person and her every
               motion, her tone of feeling, both in gaiety and sorrow, irresistible. I seated myself
               beside her on the sofa, and did as she had bid me. "I have been in love," said I, "it
               is my whole history."</p>
            <p>"And what then?" she enquired, "was your mistress unfaithful?"</p>
            <p>"I have told you all in one word — woman and infidelity go together!" I paused for
               some minutes, and when I spoke again I had obtained more self-possession.</p>
            <pb n="245" xml:id="image300"/>
            <p>"When I first went abroad," said I, "I spent some time at Florence. The fashionable
               lounge was the picture-gallery, and there was I a daily visitor but I went thither
               really to gratify my passion for paintings, and not to gaze, and be gazed at by the
               company. One morning while I was standing as usual before my favorite study, I was
               startled by some one tapping me lightly on the shoulder, I suddenly turned round — it
               was a lady, and one of the most beautiful of earth's creatures; but her look and
               attitude were even more striking than her countenance and figure. She was, in a
               manner, stealing a glance into my face, with such a curiosity, and interest, and
               earnestness, blended with such a fanciful coquetry and intelligence in her expression
               as amazed me. She enjoyed my surprise and admiration for about half a second, and
               then with the most natural negligence in the world, pointed gracefully with the hand
               which still rested on my arm, to the ground. It was her handkerchief that had fallen
               at my feet, and I instantly stooped, and raised it. She stretched out her hand to
               receive it, before I had even time to present it to her, nodded her head half with
               the air of a pleased child, half with the air of a woman of fashion, and then folding
               her arms in her drapery round her, resumed her contemplation of the painting before
               us, which this little accident seemed to have disturbed. I stood with my eyes
               fastened on <pb n="246" xml:id="image301"/>her, wondering who this enthralling
               creature could be. She had that decided air of fashion which there is no mistaking,
               and a certain air much superior to it; but there was a something so whimsical in her
               style of dress, and in her style of appearance altogether, to make me feel uncertain
               what to think of her.</p>
            <p>"Just as I was looking round to enquire her name of some bystander, she turned and
               addressed me; I forget now what it was she said to me, something about my favourite
               painting, or my general fondness for pictures; whatever it might be, I was so much a
               novice in fashion as to feel uncomfortable at her speaking to me. I remember,
               however, that though her words were select, her manner struck me as common-place;
               she, moreover, seemed to me a coquette, and I immediately concluded that she must be
               marked by all the silliness of her class. In appearance she might have been about two
               or three and twenty, but I suspect she was more, perhaps from my own inexperience,
               for she struck me as being used to the ways of the world. It was evident that she was
               aware of the admiration which she had elicited, that she had expected it, and was
               therefore pleased with it, and meant to excite a little more. No one but a boy,
               probably no one but such a boy as I, would have been seized with these reflexions at
               the moment that she was soliciting my attention; but very young men, and young men
                  <pb n="247" xml:id="image302"/>unaccustomed to general society, are naturally more
               alive to what is real and what is affected in character than those of older and
               better acquaintance with life, but whose very acquaintance has served to trammel them
               into its manoeuvres and intricacies.</p>
            <p>"She turned away after some minutes, and joined her party a few paces off. My eye
               followed them as they moved up the gallery; she shone always conspicuous among the
               throng of gentlemen who gathered as she went, around her, in clustering numbers;
               while now pausing for a second in a picturesque attitude to examine a painting — now
               breaking on my ear in tones of exaggerated feeling either of horror or of extasy —
               now partaking with faint effort in the casual vivacity of her attending bevy, or
               leading with startling violence a sudden laugh. I believe I had just then a rage for
               simplicity, for even her charms disgusted me. She was an Englishwoman too, and I had
               just been commenting, perhaps, with ungrateful sarcasm, on the freedom of Florentine
               manners. At the upper end of the gallery I lost sight of her, and when I looked
               around me I found that the crowd had followed her — there was not a creature near
               me.</p>
            <p>"Do you not know her?" said some one whom I had approached on purpose to question.
               "It is the honourable Mrs. Beaufilliers, the celebrated Mrs. Beaufilliers, she was
               the greatest beauty of the day <pb n="248" xml:id="image303"/>or of any day, and she
               never comes here without making a sensation; by the way, she means to have you in her
               train I fancy, for I saw her cast her eyes on you the moment she entered the
               room."</p>
            <p>"It is incredible how even the turn of a phrase can affect us. These few last words
               had realized all my own thoughts with regard to Mrs. Beauvilliers.</p>
            <p>"What then," said I, "she's a coquette?"</p>
            <p>"By no means," cried the other, "only a little addicted to Platonic love and
               fashionable admirers. She has us all fast here, we all wear her colours. Though,
                  <emph>par parenthese</emph>, I thought her a little gone by this morning, these
               beauties never know when to give up, unless we give them up."</p>
            <p>"Come," said he, "I'll introduce you."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," answered I, "I know her perfectly already."</p>
            <p>"I saw Mrs. Beauvilliers again, it was at a ball that very evening. She had just
               withdrawn a little out of the circle of waltzers, and was leaning against a pillar
               changing her white satin slippers. One gentleman stood beside her busied in receiving
               the discarded pair; another proffered the fresh ones; and the third, her fortunate
               partner, with one knee on the ground, supported her delicate feet by turns on the
               other and fastened the sandals.</p>
            <p>"How old is she?" asked I, "for I felt quite a curiosity to discover."</p>
            <pb n="249" xml:id="image304"/>
            <p>"Lord," answered the person next me, "I have known her culling hearts these fifty
               years!"</p>
            <p>'She could not be fifty, though she had certainly worn better than any person I know;
               even when near I could not have supposed her past thirty.</p>
            <p>"I can scarcely say how much I dislike this description of character. It revolted
               against all my nations of feminine propriety; that sensitive dignity of woman's
               peculiar nature! It offended all my most respectable feelings towards the sex, and I
               remember I stood aloof during the evening from Mrs. Beauvilliers, boyishly abashed at
               her frivolous familiarity of manners. I left Florence soon after, but I carried some
               of her impressions along with me. She spoiled me for the next twelvemonth. I had
               never before been vain of my personal qualifications, but it was not easy to forget
               that they had not been absolutely unattractive. This was all that dwelt with me, and
               some years of after life passed on the continent, though they may have habituated me
               to the looseness of its decorum, have never destroyed my esteem for all that is
               beautiful in purity!"</p>
            <p>I stopped for I felt that I was considerably agitated and my silence was of some
               duration.</p>
            <p>"You will proceed Harry?" said my cousin gently, "for your story is both interesting
               and instructive."</p>
            <p>"Yes," answered I, "but it is somewhat diffi-<pb n="250" xml:id="image305"/>cult!"
               and I still hesitated. "You should have seen her," I exclaimed at length, abruptly.
               "You should have known her, though she was scarcely handsome — I will only half name
               her to you, Agatha, as I have named her to herself in the last days of our
               acquaintance — Gabriella."</p>
            <p>"It is just about three years since we first met; I remember it well, for even then
               it was to me a circumstance of importance. I was introduced to her in a private
               concert room just as her carriage was announced — she had been standing near the
               doorway, and I was the last person she bowed to as she left the room. I remember it
               was near the end of the season. She was the fashion in London, but I had never
               admired her. I had heard her talked of as beautiful, but I had never thought her so.
               She was striking, but it was an air of fashion more than either beauty or grace in
               her appearance. I liked her reception of me; I had always allowed her to be a fine
               woman, and I found something extremely agreeable in her countenance when she spoke,
               and extreme good nature in her general manner. She rather interested me than
               otherwise, though she had only just stayed to receive my bow, and observe to me "that
               she was going," as she went out.</p>
            <p>"She had quitted town for the country before I could see her again, and not long
               after I followed her thither. I forget now who it was that invited me; I <pb n="251" xml:id="image306"/>think it was some connexion of the family, whose employment was
               to furnish the table with guests, and the guests with society. Gabriella's husband
               was of a rude description of men; he was seldom to be seen in the house but at
               dinner, and at dinner he liked to have plenty of people to talk to, and to listen to
               him. If his cold be called society, at table they had his society, but otherwise
               these general chance kind of guests were but little attended to. I should scarcely
               have availed myself, however, of this manner of admittance to hospitality, had I not
               been rather forced into calling on them on my accidentally meeting some of the party
               in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>"Agatha," cried I, "I scarcely know why I repeat these details, for it is uneasy for
               me to recal the memory of our first acquaintance!</p>
            <p>"If you had known her you would have pardoned the madness of my love — had you known
               Gabriella you would have wept for the cruelty of her caprice! Her spirit of coquetry
               was indeed untamed, untameable. She pursued me her victim with unwearied skill; flung
               with captivating ingenuity her whole heart into his service; wound her graceful toils
               around his existence, and urged on with irresistible persuasion the tortures of that
               grief which she contemplated with remorseless and insatiable ambition. How I tried to
               leave her, how I tried to escape from the influence of her fascinations, it seems of
               little pur-<pb n="252" xml:id="image307"/>pose now to tell. I did <emph>not</emph>
               leave her, and Gabriella's smiles returned. She could weep too, and at times I have
               seen a starting tear bedew her cheek. But why should I instruct you in all the arts
               and all the expedients of her most reprehensible coquetry; it was as restless as
               extravagant. She had probably never loved her husband, and esteem was what she could
               bestow on none. She was incapable of friendship; her heart had been framed to
               sentiment, she had no steadiness in her nature to persevere in her affections. Her
               husband was little calculated to excite either, and to Gabriella he was peculiarly
               unsuited. They seldom met, but no appearance of unharmony subsisted between them. I
               have known her consult him on a matter of duty, and him leave to her the choice of
               the inscriptions on his dog-collars. He never interfered with her, but he was
               sometimes glad to have her look well when she sat at the head of his table.</p>
            <p>"Her appearance had never been the lure which attracted me; and her appearance was
               then, in my opinion, by much her least qualification. Yet she possessed a large share
               of the essentials which constitute beauty: her outline of feature was good, and her
               complexion must once have been brilliant. At times it was still beautiful, for
               Gabriella was no longer quite what is called a very young woman when I knew her.</p>
            <pb n="253" xml:id="image308"/>
            <p>"She had the address to turn this want of admiration to her person on my part, into
               her most absolute attraction. Her charm consisted in her undeviating amiability of
               manner; in her apparent forbearance of disposition; in her constant propriety of
               temper; in her implicit obedience to the caprices of her admirer, and her seeming
               readiness of obedience to any exertion of authority, from the man whom she had
               received as a husband. I love to dwell on this part of her character; I would cling
               to the thought that she might once have deserved better; that she was not all that
               she appeared to me when we last met and parted — a heartless, practiced, unblushing
               and unprincipled coquette!</p>
            <p>"We have periods of feeling when it requires but a little to pen our eyes to the real
               disposition of matters carried on around us; and once awakened, it is astonishing how
               quickly we grow in wisdom. It must be always impossible in these after moments to
               trace the many, various, almost imperceptible accidents that may have occurred to
               bring us acquainted with the delusions practiced on us — perhaps which we have
               ourselves too readily indulged. To you, it will be difficult to comprehend from how
               slight a circumstance my impressions of Gabriella's character were first startled
               into a more sober reflexion on her behaviour.</p>
            <p>"I had been staggered by a sentiment, and it seemed to me a profligate sentiment. We
               were talking on the freedom of Italian manners, more especially that of the women,
               and she was expatiating on them with considerable eagerness. I remember she used the
               words, "the <emph>luxury</emph> of their independence, their perfect want of all
               control, all form — odious form!" And she threw her eyes up to Heaven as she spoke.
               She had beautiful eyes, but this time their appeal <pb n="254" xml:id="image309"/>seemed to me out of place. She threw them on <emph>me</emph>, but they did not move
               me, and she yielded her opinion as she always did, only with less hesitation than was
               usual with her, for me to be as usual satisfied with my victory. I was peculiarly
               sensitive on this one point — the delicacy of a woman's deportment; and Gabriella's
                  <emph>manner</emph> had sometimes disturbed me. I had sometimes wondered at her
               self-possession too, only that to me she was never self-possessed. She had often
               turned off an uncomfortable sentence with a gay laugh, which has covered me with
               confusion and offence, and I have felt that I should yet have been more at ease had
               she been less so.</p>
            <p>"I was silent for some time after, and thoughtful, and Gabriella tried to woo me into
               better company. She was seldom unsuccessful, and insensibly we grew into conversation
               again. One or two of the rest of the company joined us, and we gathered into a little
               circle round her sofa.</p>
            <pb n="255" xml:id="image310"/>
            <p>"The discourse turned on manners, but this time it was on English manners. A
               gentleman present, and who, by the way, was rather a celebrated traveler, just
               rising, or risen into fame and fashion, observed that in no country in the world did
               there exist such perfect domestic and conjugal happiness as in England — such an
               entire confidence between husband and wife — such a perfect union both of heart and
               mind — </p>
            <p>"Gabriella assented cordially, and applauded the feeling with warmth. I had turned
               away, and when I looked again I found that her eyes were bent on the traveler.</p>
            <p>"Where — in what other country," pursued he, "do we find such an agreeable social
               intercourse to prevail between an man and his wife. Even in the highest walks of life
               there is visible such an exquisite and charming familiarity. To take a fanciful view
               of the subject, for instance, that one little circumstance of calling each other by
               the mere Christian name abbreviated, as we hear it too, in every possible way, by
               people of the first fashion, speaks volumes."</p>
            <p>"Poor Mama!" exclaimed Gabriella, "I remember Mama always called poor Papa,
               Beau!"</p>
            <p>"Who was your mother?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Heavens!" cried she, "Don't you know? The beautiful Mrs. Beauvilliers. 'La bella
               bellissima,' <pb n="256" xml:id="image311"/>as she was called in Italy! I was in
               mourning for her when I first saw <emph>you</emph>. Have you never seen the beautiful
               miniature of Mama in my room?"</p>
            <p>"I have seen the original," answered I, "in the picture gallery at Florence."</p>
            <p>"Whether it was the tone of my voice, for I felt that it was altered, or the
               expression of my countenance, for I was crimsoned to the temples, that struck
               Gabriella, I know not — but she changed the conversation. For my part I had relapsed
               into my silence, and I slunk away. Gabriella the daughter of Mrs. Beauvilliers!</p>
            <p>"Why have you never told me that you had been at Florence?" said she next morning
               when we were alone. "How odd! We must have been there together, and we were
               strangers!"</p>
            <p>"I knew your mother," said I.</p>
            <p>"Poor Mama! Heavens! How beautiful she must have been. But did you absolutely know
               her. I thought I had known the whole circle of Mama's admirers."</p>
            <p>"But why need I go on. It was, perhaps, fortunate for me that I could never separate
               the connexion between Mrs. Beauvilliers and Gabriella. The early impression of her
               mother which had been left so strongly on my mind, could not be effaced by any
               recurrence to the daughter. I could never think on Gabriella without recalling to my
               recollection Mrs. <pb n="257" xml:id="image312"/>Beauvilliers in the picture gallery,
               or in the ballroom at Florence. However disguised might be their manner, their
               conduct was too similar to bear comparison. From the suddenness with which the veil
               of my illusion fell from before my eyes almost from that very hour it would seem now
               as if I had been influenced by prejudice. But no, it was Gabriella's self that cast
               it from me. True, my knowledge of her mother's character had given me an insight into
               the character of the daughter. It had made me think, and thought was destruction to
               Gabriella. Her behaviour could not bear investigation — her character still less so.
               It was not the shock of Mrs. Beauvilliers as a mother that had disturbed me, it was
               the dread of Mrs. Beauvilliers as a model for too apt a representation; and what as
               the folly of a foolish woman would have passed without other reproach, grew criminal
               in the more gifted intellect of her daughter.</p>
            <p>"Gabriella's defence was powerless. The dream which had wrapped my senses gave way
               gradually but quickly, as the imperfect light that had first dawned on me broke into
               open day. Her struggles to retain her victim became only the more reprehensible, her
               real grief at his escape only the greater earnest of the selfish, frivolous vanity
               which had induced his capture. Her powers of complete self-interest and indifference
               to all beside were indeed <pb n="258" xml:id="image313"/>wonderful! With a voice, a
               look, a gesture, still pleading with well feigned motive for delay, she turned
               without a moment lost to lament her failure, from the resolute departure of the one
               lover, to play with unabated assiduity the same game over again with another.</p>
            <p>"My last glimpse of her, as my chaise rolled rapidly away, showed her turning from
               the entrance door into the little walk that leads to her flower-garden, leaning on
               the arm of the traveller.</p>
            <p>"But to the end, mistress of her art, she has left me without a doubt of her
               unworthiness still to regret in bitter hopelessness the peace of mind that she has
               broken for ever."</p>
            <p>I rose as I concluded, and walked to the window, for it was a moment of weakness over
               which I had no control. But the effort was not sufficient, and I buried my face in my
               hands.</p>
            <p>I was roused by my cousin's gentle voice, and she laid her soft white hand upon my
               arm. "Harry," said she, "if I may trust this moment's sorrow, your peace of mind — it
               is not broken for ever."</p>
            <p>"Agatha," said I, "it is not to such as you that I should betray the secrets of a
               weak and miserable passion. It is not with such as you that I should contemplate the
               frailties of an erring sex; but I cannot forget that such a fair creation has been
               created to so little good."</p>
            <pb n="259" xml:id="image314"/>
            <p>"I regret it with you — but I have seen Gabriella," she continued, "I have known her
               — she was unworthy of you — yet her troth was plighted to another, she could break
               none with you."</p>
            <p>"Good God! What other!"</p>
            <p>"And do you then," said Agatha, gravely, "think so lightly of the duties of a wife.
               Believe me it is the highest station which the heart, or the ambition of woman should
               aspire to. She is charged with the dearest interests of one more responsible in life
               than herself — his most tender dignity is confided to her care, and if she break her
               trust, if she be wanting but in the smallest portion of this silent bond, she
               violates the most solemn engagement of her life, and is forsworn before God and man
               in the vows which she has taken upon her in the presence of both?" She stopped, and
               coloured at her own eloquence. "Harry," said she, "What do you regret? your peace of
               mind? Let it return to you — let not the caprices of an ill-guided woman weigh upon
               you. There are some thanks due for the return to a duty from which you should never
               have wandered."</p>
            <p>"I am grateful," said I, "as grateful as I can be. I feel that it is beneath me to
               dwell thus on the memory of such a woman. But when you have loved, Agatha, you will
               forgive a weakness, which, like an early deep-rooted disease, still continues to
               sting me with poignancy, in utter defiance of the leech's <pb n="260" xml:id="image315"/>utmost skill. Oh, Agatha — dear Agatha — you have never — never
               loved — "</p>
            <p>The expression of her countenance caught my attention just then, but she was
               silent.</p>
            <p>"Have you ever loved," cried I, forgetting at the moment all else but what was
               belonging to my cousin Agatha. She smiled, but her smile was followed by a sigh.</p>
            <p>A strange feeling came over me, and I caught her hand. I scarcely know what I said,
               but it was not of Gabriella that I spoke or thought. There was a slight flutter
               visible in her countenance when I began, but she listened to me with mildness; then
               with a gentle shake of her head she extricated her hand, and glided from the
               window.</p>
