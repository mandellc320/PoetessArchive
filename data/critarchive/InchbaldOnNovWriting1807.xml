               <hi rendition="#smcaps">Sir,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the critical knowledge of an art was invariably combined with the successful
               practice of it, I would here proudly take my rank among artists, and give
               instructions on the art of writing Novels.—But though I humbly confess that I have
               not the slightest information to impart, that may tend to produce a good novel; yet
               it may not be wholly incompatible with the useful design of your publication, if I
               show—how to avoid writing a very bad one.</p>
            <p>Observe, that your hero and heroine be neither of them too bountiful. The prodigious
               sums of money which are given away every year in novels, ought, in justice, to be
               subject to the property tax; by which regulation, the national treasury, or every
               such book, would be highly benefited.</p>
            <p>Beware how you imitate <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</ref>,
               or <ref target="people.html#EdgeworthMaria">Maria</ref>
               <lb/>
               <fw type="vol">No. 14.</fw>
               <fw type="sig">
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">c</hi>
               </fw>
               <pb n="10"/>
               <ref target="people.html#EdgeworthMaria">Edgeworth</ref>; you cannot equal them; and
               those readers who most admire their works, will most despise yours.</p>
            <p>Take care to reckon up the many times you make use of the words "Amiable,"
               "Interesting," "Elegant," "Sensibility," "Delicacy," "Feeling." Count each of these
               words over before you send your manuscript to be printed, and be sure to erase half
               the number you have written;—you may erase again when your first proof comes from the
               press—again, on having a revise—and then mark three or four, as mistakes of the
               printer, in your Errata.</p>
            <p>Examine likewise, and for the same purpose, the various times you have made your
               heroine blush, and your hero turn pale—the number of times he has pressed her hand to
               his "trembling lips," and she his letters to her "beating heart"—the several times he
               has been "speechless" and she "all emotion," the one "struck to the soul;" the other
               "struck dumb."</p>
            <p>The lavish use of "tears," both in "showers" and "floods," should next be
               scrupulously avoided; though many a gentle reader will weep on being told that others
               are weeping, and require no greater cause to excite their compassion. </p>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>Consider well before you introduce a child into your work. To maim the characters of
               men and women is no venial offence; but to destroy innocent babes is most ferocious
               cruelty: and yet this savage practice has, of late, arrived at such excess, that
               numberless persons of taste and sentiment have declared—they will never read another
               novel, unless the advertisement which announces the book, adds (as in advertisements
               for letting Lodgings) <hi rendition="#italics">There are no children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you are contriving that incident where your heroine is in danger of being
               drowned, burnt, or her neck broken by the breaking of an axle-tree—for without perils
               by fire, water, or coaches, your book would be incomplete—it might be advisable to
               suffer her to be rescued from impending death by the sagacity of a dog, a fox, a
               monkey, or a hawk; any one to whom she cannot give her hand in marriage; for whenever
               the deliverer is a fine young man, the catastrophe of your plot is foreseen, and
               suspense extinguished.</p>
            <p>Let not your ambition to display variety cause you to produce such a number of
               personages in your story, as shall create perplexity, dissipate curiosity, and
               confound recollection. But if, to show your powers of invention, <lb/><fw type="sig">

               </fw>
               <pb n="12"/>you are resolved to introduce your reader to a new acquaintance in every
               chapter, and in every chapter snatch away his old one; he will soon have the
               consolation to perceive—they are none of them worth his regret.</p>
            <p>Respect virtue—nor let her be so warm or so violent as to cause derision:—nor vice so
               enormous as to resemble insanity. No one can be interested for an enthusiast—nor gain
               instruction for a madman. </p>
            <p>And when you have written as good a novel as you can—compress it into three or four
               short volumes at most; or the man of genius, whose moments are precious, and on whose
               praise all your fame depends, will not find time to read the production, till you
               have committed suicide in consequence of its ill reception with the public.</p>
            <p>There are two classes of readers among this public, of whom it may not be wholly from
               the purpose to give a slight account. The first are all hostile to originality. They
               are so devoted to novel-reading, that they admire one novel because it puts them in
               mind of another, which they admired a few days before. By them it is required, that a
               novel should be like a novel; that is, the majority of those compositions; for the
               minor part describe fic-<pb n="13"/>titious characters and events merely as they are
               in real life:—ordinary representations, beneath the concern of a true voracious
               novel-reader.</p>
            <p>Such an one (more especially of the female sex) is indifferent to the fate of
               nations, or the fate of her own family, whilst some critical situation in a romance
               agitates her whole frame! Her neighbour might meet with an accidental death in the
               next street, the next house, or the next room, and the shock would be trivial,
               compared to her having just read—"that the amiable Sir Altamont, beheld the
               interesting Eudocia, faint in the arms of his thrice happy rival."</p>
            <p>Affliction, whether real or imaginary, must be refined,—and calamity elegant, before
               this novel-reader can be roused to "sympathetic sensation." Equally unsusceptible is
               her delicate soul to vulgar happiness. Ease and content are mean possessions! She
               requires transport, rapture, bliss, extatic [sic] joy, in the common occurrences of
               every day. </p>
            <p>She saunters pensively in shady bowers, or strides majestically through brilliant
               circles. She dresses by turns like a Grecian statue and a pastoral nymph: then <pb
                  n="14"/> fancies herself as beautiful as the undone heroine in "<title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Barbarous Seduction;</hi>
               </title>" and has no objection to become equally fortunate.</p>
            <p>To the healthy, that food is nourishment, which to the sickly proves their poison.
               Such is the quality of books to the strong, and to the weak of understanding.—Lady
               Susan is of another class of readers, and has good sense.—Let her therefore read
               certain well-written novels, and she will receive intimation of two or three foibles,
               the self-same as those, which, adhering to her conduct, cast upon all her virtues a
               degree of ridicule.—These failings are beneath the animadversions of the pulpit. They
               are so trivial yet so awkward, that neither sermons, history, travels, nor biography,
               could point them out with propriety. They are ludicrous, and can only be described
               and reformed by a humourist.</p>
            <p>And what book so well as a novel, could show to the enlightened Lord Henry——the
               arrogance of his extreme condescension? Or insinuate to the judgment of Lady
               Eliza——the wantonness of her excessive reserve?</p>
            <p>What friend could whisper so well to Lady Autumnal—that affected simplicity at forty,
               is more despicable <pb n="15"/>than affected knowledge at fifteen?—And by what better
               means could the advice be conveyed to Sir John Egotist—to pine no more at what the
               world may say of him; for that men like himself are too insignificant for the world
               to know.</p>
            <p>A novel could most excellently represent to the valiant General B—, that though he
               can forgive the miser's love of gold, the youth's extravagance and even profligacy;
               that although he has a heart to tolerate all female faults, and to compassionate
               human depravity of every kind; he still exempts from this his universal clemency—the
               poor delinquent soldier.</p>
            <p>The General's wife, too, forgives all injuries done to her neighbours: those to
               herself are of such peculiar kind, that it would be encouragement to offenders, not
               to seek vengeance.—The lovely Clarissa will pardon every one—except the mantua-maker
               who spoils her shape.—And good Sir Gormand never bears malice to a soul on earth—but
               to the cook who spoils his dinner.</p>
            <p>That Prebendary is merciful to a proverb—excluding negligence towards holy things—of
               which he thinks himself the holiest. Certain novels might make these people think a
               second time.</p>
            <pb n="16"/>
            <p>Behold the Countess of L——! Who would presume to tell that once celebrated
               beauty—that she is now too wrinkled for curling hair; and her complexion too faded
               for the mixture of blooming pink? Should her husband convey such unwelcome news, he
               would be more detested than he is at present! Were her children or her waiting-maid
               to impart such intelligence, they would experience more of her peevishness than
               ever!—A novel assumes a freedom of speech to which all its readers must patiently
               listen; and by which, if they are wise, they will know how to profit.</p>
            <p>The Novelist is a free agent. He lives in a land of liberty, whilst the Dramatic
               Writer exists but under a despotic government.—Passing over the subjection in which
               an author of plays is held by the Lord Chamberlain’s office, and the degree of
               dependence which he has on his actors—he is the very slave of the audience. He must
               have their tastes and prejudices in view, not to correct, but to humour them. Some
               auditors of a theatre, like some aforesaid novel-readers, love to see that which they
               have seen before; and originality, under the opprobrious name of innovation, might be
               fatal to a drama, where the will of such critics is the law, and execution instantly
               follows judgment.</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>In the opinion of these theatrical juries, Virtue and Vice attach to situations, more
               than to characters: at least, so they will have the stage represent. The great moral
               inculcated in all modern plays constantly is—for the rich to love the poor. As if it
               was not much more rare, and a task by far more difficult—for the poor to love the
               rich.—And yet, what author shall presume to expose upon the stage, certain faults,
               almost inseparable from the indigent? What dramatic writer dares to expose in a
               theatre, the consummate vanity of a certain rank of paupers, who boast of that
               wretched state as a sacred honour, although it be the result of indolence or
               criminality? Who dares to show an audience, the privilege, of poverty debased into
               the instrument of ingratitude?—"I am poor and therefore slighted"—cries the
               unthankful beggar; whilst his poverty is his sole recommendation to his friends; and
               for which alone, they pay him much attention, and some respect. </p>
            <p>What dramatist would venture to bring upon the stage—that which so frequently occurs
               in real life—a benefactor living in awe of the object of his bounty; trembling in the
               presence of the man whom he supports, lest by one inconsiderate word, he should seem
               to remind him of the <lb/>

               <pb n="18"/>predicament in which they stand with each other; or by an involuntary
               look, seem to glance at such and such obligations?</p>
            <p>Who, moreover, dares to exhibit upon the stage, a benevolent man, provoked by his
               crafty dependant—for who is proof against ungratefulness?—to become that very tyrant,
               which he unjustly had reported him?</p>
            <p>Again.—The giver of alms, as well as the alms-receiver, must be revered on the
               stage.—That rich proprietor of land, Lord Forecast, who shall dare to bring him upon
               the boards of a theatre, and show—that, on the subject of the poor, the wily Forecast
               accomplishes two most important designs? By keeping the inhabitants of his domain
               steeped in poverty, he retains his vast superiority on earth; then secures, by acts
               of charity, a chance for heaven. </p>
            <p>A dramatist must not speak of national concerns, except in one dull round of
               panegyrick. He must not allude to the feeble minister of state, nor to the
               ecclesiastical coxcomb.</p>
            <p>Whilst the poor dramatist is, therefore, confined to a few particular provinces; the
               novel-writer has the whole world to range, in search of men and topics. Kings,<pb
                  n="19"/> warriors, statesmen, churchmen, are all subjects of his power. The mighty
               and the mean, the common-place and the extraordinary, the profane and the sacred, all
               are prostrate before his muse. Nothing is forbidden, nothing is withheld from the
               imitation of a novelist, except—other novels.</p>
