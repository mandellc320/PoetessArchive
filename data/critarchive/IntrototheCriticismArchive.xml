					works and others have contributed to our growing understanding of the extent and
					significance of early criticism published by British women. </p>
				<p> As Peiser notes, however, particularly in the case of the periodical criticism
					on which her essay depends, identification of and access to women&apos;s
					literary criticism remains a challenge. Periodical criticism was often published
					anonymously, and even when identification is possible, assembling a body of work
					for teaching or research can be laborious at best. This archive collects
					criticism published by women during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to
					enrich study of their creative works, to challenge narrow assumptions about
					where women&apos;s literary commentary appeared and the breadth of issues it
					addressed, and to reveal the conscious authority of women writers&apos; critical
					voices. At the same time, in presenting women&apos;s views on literature and
					aesthetics, this collection can encourage new perspectives on the nature,
					purposes, and principles of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary
					criticism, regardless of who may be the author. </p>
				<p rendition="#pnoindent">I. Aesthetic Innovations</p>
				<p> Study of criticism by women reveals that women critics could be in the vanguard
					of debates over literary standards and aesthetics. For example, <ref
						target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>&apos;s 1800 preface
					to <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Lyrical Ballads</title></hi> is considered a
					landmark in early nineteenth-century literary theory for its explanation of the
					premises behind a collection of poems that broke new ground in both form and
					content. Yet in her &quot;<title>Introductory Discourse</title>&quot; to <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>Plays on the Passions</title></hi> (1798), <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> articulated several
					of <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>&apos;s most
					innovative ideas while anticipating his treatise by two years. Convinced that
					psychological states were more interesting than external events, <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> devoted her preface and
					indeed her writing career to exploring how such powerful but shifting internal
					effects could be conveyed in their full subtlety to a theater audience. Even
					earlier, <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wollstonecraft</ref>
					had voiced many of <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"
					>Wordsworth</ref>&apos;s views in similar language in her 1797 essay
						&quot;<title>On Artificial Taste</title>,&quot; published in the <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>Monthly Magazine</title></hi>, where she
					explores the relationship between immediate feeling and direct experience of
					nature on one hand and &quot;natural,&quot; affecting poetry on the other. It
					diminishes none of these writers to recognize that all were concerned with
					finding a smooth conduit between emotional experience and literary expression.
					Rather, reading all three can enhance our appreciation of the relationship
					between emotional authenticity, communication of feeling, and literary language,
					one of the more significant aesthetic concerns of the early nineteenth century.
						<ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>&apos;s essay, like
						<ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>&apos;s,
					prefaced a collection of her own work&#8212;in this case, several plays&#8212;so
					differing from familiar practices that she felt readers would need a framework
					to appreciate them. And like <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"
						>Wordsworth</ref>&apos;s preface, <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
						>Baillie</ref>&apos;s &quot;<title>Introductory Discourse</title>&quot;
					develops a coherent theory for a literary form – in her case closet drama – that
					comprises an important contribution to a major literary genre.<hi
						rendition="#sup"><note>See Catherine Burroughs, <hi
								rendition="#italics"><title>Closet Stages: <ref
										target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> and
									the Theater Theory of British Romantic Women
								Writers</title></hi>, U of Pennsylvania P, 1997. </note></hi>
				</p>
				<p> A milestone in literary criticism and theory, <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>&apos;s is not the only
					major essay penned by a woman to revise genre theory and history. Coming a
					decade later, &quot;<title>On the Origin and Progress of
					Novel-Writing,</title>&quot; <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Anna Letitia
						Barbauld</ref>&apos;s introductory essay to the fifty-volume collection <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>The British Novelists</title></hi>, offered an
					early contribution to genre classification and literary theory as well as a
					prototypical canon of British fiction. <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs"
						>Barbauld</ref>&apos;s essay and her individual introductions to featured
					novelists revised literary history in ways that gave unprecedented attention to
					the contribution of women writers. At the same time, she argued that fictional
					literature deserved more respect than most critics were willing to grant it. As
					the introduction to the first definitive selection of complete text British
					novels, the essay appeared in a context that had few rivals in either prestige
					or appeal to national pride. </p>
				<p> When women&apos;s criticism enjoyed the prominence of <ref
						target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>&apos;s &quot;<title>Origin
						and Progress of Novel-Writing</title>,&quot; it was because of, not despite,
					the critic&apos;s name. By the time <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs"
						>Barbauld</ref>&apos;s essay appeared, she had gained renown as a poet,
					educator, children&apos;s author, political polemicist, literary biographer,
					critic, and editor. The full title of the collection, boasting &quot;<title>with
						an essay, and prefaces biographical and critical, by <ref
							target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Mrs. Barbauld</ref></title>,&quot;
					indicates the prestige and commercial appeal that the publishers hoped to gain
					from <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>&apos;s name. Much like
						<ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>, <ref
						target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Elizabeth Inchbald</ref> was likewise
					recruited to write criticism because of her celebrity, in her case as a popular
					actress, playwright, and novelist, yet her criticism broke new ground as well.
						<ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</ref>&apos;s prefaces to the
					individual plays included in <hi rendition="#italics"><title>The British
							Theatre</title></hi> (1806-8) turned away from established models of
					Shakespeare criticism to emphasize staging and theatrical history, helping to
					shift the direction of theater criticism for decades to come. Meanwhile,
					although <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</ref>&apos;s essays
					appeared first as individual installments, when brought together for the 1808
					bound set, they offer, as did <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
						>Baillie</ref>&apos;s &quot;<title>Introductory Discourse</title>,&quot; a
					coherent theory of closet drama. </p>
				<p> Like <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>&apos;s
						&quot;<title>Origin and Progress of Novel-Writing</title>,&quot; <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>The British Theatre</title></hi> bound set
					appealed to the burgeoning sense of British national pride and the expanding
					consumer market for the appurtenances of elegant sophistication, but it was
					priced well out of reach of all but the most affluent middle- and upper-class
					readers. But against the consumer-driven status of an attractively bound
					matching set stands the other form in which <ref
						target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</ref>&apos;s prefaces
					appeared&#8212;brief essays, each introducing a single recently popular play,
					published in inexpensive, weekly installments. Though lacking the grandeur of
					the costly collection, this more ephemeral form of publication could reach a
					wider, more diverse audience. </p>
				<p rendition="#pnoindent">II. Literary Reviewing</p>
				<p> While the prestige of prefatory essays to major collections is undeniable, no
					criticism by Romantic-era British women writers reached as many readers and yet
					has been as underrated as that in literary magazines, particularly literary
					reviews. Especially toward the end of the eighteenth century, the number of
					literary magazines and reviews increased dramatically while at the same time
					women began to contribute to these new periodicals more frequently. As was
					generally the practice in periodical criticism, most of these articles were
					published unsigned. Consequently, although letters, diary entries, editors&apos;
					marked copies, and the like have led to some attributions of women&apos;s
					periodical criticism, it is impossible to gauge how much can no longer be
					identified. Yet the invisibility of this work belies its importance. James
					Basker argues that literary journalism <quote rendition="#pnoindent">introduced
						new, more accessible forums for critical discussion; it multiplied and
						diversified the opportunities for critical expression; it fostered new
						critical values, drew attention to new literary genres, systematized the
						treatment of established ones, and expanded the audience for criticism. […]
						in subtler ways it affected canon formation, reception history, the
						emergence of affective criticism, the assimilation of foreign influences,
						the segregation of &apos;women&apos;s literature&apos;, and ultimately the
						politics of culture.<hi rendition="#sup"><note>James Basker,
									&quot;<title>Criticism and the Rise of Periodical
									Literature,</title>&quot; <hi rendition="#italics"

					</quote> And if literary periodicals so dramatically influenced aesthetics,
					culture, and critical practice, they had a similar impact on Romantic
					writers&apos; careers. Reviewing and similar literary commentary provided both
					income and an avenue to public authority, and many women writers followed this
					model of professionalism. </p>

				<p rendition="#pnoindent">A. Establishing Literary Authority in a Changing Print
					Culture</p>
				<p> The earliest women literary critics usually came from the genteel classes. These
					women had access to education and leisure to read and write. Moreover, until the
					end of the eighteenth century, the nature of publishing explicitly emphasized
					the amateur or dilettante, especially in the case of women. Most women writers,
					critics included, emerged from the aristocratic milieu of coterie publication.
					Access to publishers depended on these connections, in the form of either a
					single prestigious patron or a subscription in which acquaintances and their
					connections would underwrite the cost of publication. Within these networks,
					writing entertained one&apos;s acquaintances and displayed one&apos;s talents.
					Though publishing might bring much needed money to a writer patronized by the
					more affluent members of the circle, the ostensible purpose of disseminating a
					work was to expand the circle of edification and enjoyment. But as the
					eighteenth century drew to a close, patronage forms of publication gave way to a
					more modern, professional literary culture where contracts and direct
					transactions between publisher and writer became paramount, where relationships
					between writers and publishers were more direct and might include various types
					of literary work, and where publishers might rely on writers&apos; current
					specializations and expect writers to cultivate new ones. While the numbers of
					women publishing in all forms increased rapidly, the ever more commercialized
					literary world came more firmly under control of the male dominated world of
					large publishing houses and heavyweight literary magazines and reviews. Among
					those women who best adapted to this masculine world of early professionalized
					literary culture, authoring literary criticism often played a decisive role. </p>
				<p> The landscape of British women&apos;s literary history would present a very
					different view if it were not for criticism&apos;s financial, intellectual, and
					even emotional impact. Criticism brought poet <ref
						target="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Elizabeth Moody</ref>, for example, into
					a circle of literary professionals that nudged her out of the amateur world of
					coterie circulation into commercial publication of both her creative and her
					critical work. For others such as <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary"
						>Mary Wollstonecraft</ref>, criticism provided the financial stability to
					launch a literary career. Writing on demand for bookseller <ref
						target="people.html#JohnsonJoseph">Joseph Johnson</ref> and especially
					reviewing for his new <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Analytical
						Review</title></hi> allowed <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary"
						>Wollstonecraft</ref> to escape the lonely, taxing positions of governess
					and companion and establish herself in London, where she joined the most vibrant
					literary community in late eighteenth-century Britain. Further, for <ref
						target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Wollstonecraft</ref> and some other
					young writers such as <ref target="people.html#MartineauHarriet">Harriet
						Martineau</ref> and <ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Letitia
						Landon</ref>, reading for a demanding schedule of reviewing provided
					intellectual training, broadening and deepening their thinking and preparing
					them for the creative or analytical work for which they are best known today.
					And for <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>, criticism appears
					to have sustained her financially while providing her, according to her niece
					and first biographer, with an intellectual and emotional lifeline at the time of
					her husband&apos;s mental collapse and eventual suicide.<hi rendition="#sup"

				</p>
				<p> When literary culture had been supported largely by patronage, authors knew much
					of their audience, either personally or implicitly as connections of a patron or
					acquaintance. Mostly from the genteel classes, these readers were often better
					educated than the general run of English men and women, with taste that had been
					formed on classical literature and more recent works modeled on the classical
					tradition. But late in the eighteenth century, authors and critics began to
					realize that the makeup of the reading population had changed, and that many new
					readers lacked the education and hence the commonly agreed upon standards of
					taste that the literary world had formerly counted on. In the minds of some, the
					spread of reading and the variety of new types of publications undermined a
					social order where the makeup of the reading public could be known and standards
					of taste assumed to be shared. Many critics saw a need to generate broader
					acceptance for the literary values they regarded as desirable and they began to
					try to police the taste of these new readers, demonstrating that aesthetic
					standards were far from self-evident, but were instead subject to lively debate.
					Meanwhile, it was not merely authors and critics who experienced anxieties about
					the new readers. Regarding familiarity with literature as a necessary mark of
					gentility, the expanding middle class that comprised many of these new readers
					turned to criticism, especially in periodicals, for guidance in developing their
					literary taste.<hi rendition="#sup"><note>See Basker as well as
							William St. Clair, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>The Reading Nation in
									the Romantic Period</title></hi>, Cambridge UP,
						2004.</note></hi> Yet the popularity of scores of novels scorned in reviews
					reveals a disquieting gap between the critic and an anonymous reading public
					with inclinations that resisted critical discipline. </p>
				<p rendition="#pnoindent">B. Revising Aesthetic Standards</p>
				<p> If criticism failed to fully control public response to literary works,
					aesthetic standards shifted as well. While the neoclassical standards that had
					once held wide currency lost much favor by the end of the eighteenth century,
					some of the ideals that were central at the beginning of the nineteenth century
					have likewise declined in appeal since. Sentimentality, for example, was a hotly
					debated topic, and in its more florid manifestations critics often objected that
					it debased a literary work, making it suitable only for a sensation market. But
					when modulated, emotional content enjoyed broad currency during much of the
					later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many readers and writers believed
					that emotional appeals offered a route for literature to help better society by
					cultivating individual sensitivity and sympathy.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">See especially G.J. Barker-Benfield, <hi
								rendition="#italics"><title>The Culture of Sensibility: Sex and
									Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain</title></hi>, U of Chicago

					Thus, sentiment and sensibility underlay much of the interest in moral effect
					that was common to many critics, male and female, during the later years of the
					eighteenth century. In fact, the demand for a positive moral tendency was in
					itself a contested issue. Some critics followed <ref
						target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Samuel Johnson</ref> in suggesting that
					literature should teach moral values by presenting only the highest examples
					worthy of emulation. Yet others, such as <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs"
						>Barbauld</ref>, explicitly argue that literature need not conform to such
					restrictive standards, nor, indeed need it explicitly serve a higher social
					purpose. <ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref> champions the
					central significance of other qualities such as entertainment value, form,
					versification, imagery, characterization, means of creating suspense, and
					credibility or realism. </p>
				<p> Meanwhile, not only did shifting standards mean that few aesthetic ideals could
					claim general acceptance, but in addition, many literary reviews had not yet
					acknowledged aesthetic evaluation to be part of their task. During the first
					half-century of the literary review, the imposition of the critic&apos;s own
					opinion was often considered a corruption in the true purposes of a review. Many
					critics presumed a highly educated and almost exclusively male audience, whom
					they assumed to be capable of making their own judgments about literature. The
					review&apos;s purpose was to present objective summary and extract to facilitate
					those judgments. But by the end of the eighteenth century, literary reviews
					found much of their readership among the expanding middle class, including
					middle-class women. Many of these readers had only modest formal education, and
					in reading about literature, they sought the kind of guidance provided in one
					important predecessor for literary reviews&#8212;popular periodical papers along
					the lines of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Joseph Addison</ref>&apos;s
						<hi rendition="#italics"><title>Spectator</title></hi> and <ref
						target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Samuel Johnson</ref>&apos;s <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>Rambler</title></hi>. These forebears showcased
					the merits of literary works, educating readers about literature and aesthetics
					and helping form reader taste. </p>
				<p> If such high-minded aspirations informed part of the purpose of some criticism,
					entertainment often played a vital role as well. Indeed, while many articles
					aspired to objectivity, others strove for entertainment in the criticism itself.
					Women critics might strive for entertainment by such means as structuring a
					critical essay in the form of a dialog, as did <ref
						target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Ann Radcliffe</ref>, a strategy that
					allowed for posing multiple critical perspectives while integrating some of the
					diverting qualities of fiction and drama. In some cases, too, wit and irony
					allowed a bridge between the older cultures of coterie circulation and modern
					mass publication, as when <ref target="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Elizabeth
						Moody</ref> masquerades as a male writer enjoying tobacco and port with his
					reading. While <ref target="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Moody</ref>&apos;s
					urbane, satirical tone would have amused most readers, only the few who knew the
					anonymous author to be a woman could have fully appreciated the humor. In other
					instances, articles that repeat assessments that had already become commonplace,
					such as <ref target="people.html#JewsburyMaria">Maria Jane Jewsbury</ref>&apos;s
					essay on <ref target="people.html#AustenJane">Jane Austen</ref>, suggest that
					readers sometime cared as much for the pleasure of affirming comfortably
					accepted ideas as for original and rigorous criticism. The fact that some of
					these articles held the prestigious lead article positions confirms that this
					purpose was accepted by publishers and readers alike. </p>
				<p rendition="#pnoindent">C. Further Insights</p>
				<p> Much remains to be uncovered in early literary criticism by women. A few
					additional issues have already emerged, however, that are worth noting. For one,
					women critics often used commentary on literature to participate in wide-ranging
					debates on topics of public concern. While talking about literature, women
					comment on public events or call attention to the ways literature affects public
					issues. Their comments on British character or the British literary heritage,
					for example, demonstrate that they understood national identity and character as
					historically and culturally determined. When women critics speak of
					literature&apos;s influence on individual virtue, for instance, they frequently
					do so in terms of the ways literature shapes national character. Moreover, women
					critics show strong interest in women writers. Not only do women critics
					frequently praise other women writers, but they sometimes capitalize on the
					occasion of reviewing one female writer to promote other women writers, as when
						<ref target="people.html#JewsburyMaria">Jewsbury</ref> endorses <ref
						target="people.html#SoutheyCaroline">Caroline Bowles</ref> while writing on
						<ref target="people.html#AustenJane">Jane Austen</ref>. Yet women critics
					often hold their female contemporaries to exacting standards, refusing to follow
					the example of feigned tolerance that provided a thin veneer for their male
					contemporaries&apos; clubby assurance of feminine literary inferiority. Where
					women critics include patronizing expressions like &quot;the fair author,&quot;
					close reading of the discussion often reveals elements of parody or humor. </p>
				<p rendition="#pnoindent">III. Conclusion</p>
				<p> There is much to be gained, then, from incorporating early women&apos;s literary
					criticism into our study of our literary past. The aspiration in creating this
					archive is to make this criticism more accessible, encouraging teaching,
					research, and enjoyment of this rich resource. It is to be hoped that doing so
					will give rise to new research, new questions, and new insights about not
					only early women&apos;s criticism, but early women writers and literary history
					as a whole. </p>
