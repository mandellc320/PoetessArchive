               <hi rendition="#largest">A</hi> TASTE for rural scenes, in the present state of
                    society, appears to me to be very often an artificial sentiment, rather inspired
                    by poetry and romances, than a real perception of the beauties of nature; but,
                    as it is reckoned a proof of refined taste to praise the calm pleasure which the
                    country affords, the theme is exhausted; yet, it may be made a question, whether
                    this romantic kind of declamation has much effect on the conduct of those who
                    leave, for a season, the crowded cities in which they were bred. </p>
            <p> I have been led into these reflections by observing, when I have resided for any
                    length of time in the country, how few people seem to contemplate nature with
                    their own eyes. I have âbrushed the dew awayâ<hi rendition="#sup">

                        <title>Reflections on Death</title>
                     </hi> (1763)
                            by William Dodd L.L.D (1729-1777), a clergyman, biblical commentator,
                            and literary critic who had been convicted and executed for forgery.
                            Dodd's book had been reprinted numerous times, including the year
                            before Wollstonecraftâs essay.</note>
               </hi> in the morning; but, pacing
                    over the printless grass, I have wondered that, in such delightful situations,
                    the sun was allowed to rise in solitary majesty, whilst my eyes alone hailed its
                    beautifying beams. The webs of the evening have still been spread across the
                    hedged path, unless some labouring man, trudging to work, disturbed the fairy
                    structure; yet, in spite of this supineness, on joining the social circle, every
                    tongue rang changes on the pleasures of the country. </p>
            <p> Having frequently had occasion to make the same observation, in one of my
                    solitary rambles, I was led to endeavour to trace the cause, and likewise to
                    enquire why the poetry, written in the infancy of society, is most natural:
                    which, strictly speaking (for natural is a very indefinite expression) is merely
                    to say, that it is the transcript of immediate emotions, when fancy, awakened by
                    the view of interesting objects, in all their native wildness and simplicity,
                    was most actively at work. At such moments, sensibility quickly furnishes
                    similes, and the sublimated spirits combine with happy facilityâimages,
                    which spontaneously bursting on him, it is not necessary coldly to ransack the
                    understanding or memory, till the laborious efforts of judgment exclude present
                    sensations, and damp the fire of enthusiasm. </p>
            <p> The effusions of a vigorous mind will, nevertheless, ever inform us how far the
                    faculties have been enlarged by thought, and stored with knowledge. The richness
                    of the soil even appears on the surface; and the result of profound thinking
                    often mixing with playful grace in the reveries of the poet, smoothly
                    incorporates with the ebullitions of animal spirits, when the finely-fashioned
                    nerve vibrates acutely with rapture, or when relaxed by soft melancholy, a
                    pleasing languor prompts the long-drawn sigh, and feeds the slowly falling tear. </p>
            <p> The poet, the man of strong feelings, only gives us a picture of his mind when
                        <pb n="280"/> he was actually alone, conversing with himself, and marking
                    the impression which nature made on his own heart. If, during these sacred
                    moments, the idea of some departed friendâsome tender recollection, when
                    the soul was most alive to tenderness, intrudes unawares into his mind, the
                    sorrow which it produces is artlessly, but poetically, expressed; and who can
                    avoid sympathizing? </p>
            <p> Love of man leads to devotion. Grand and sublime images strike the imagination.
                    God is seen in every floating cloud, and comes from the misty mountain to
                    receive the noblest homage of an intelligent creatureâpraise. How solemn
                    is the moment, when all affections and remembrances fade before the sublime
                    admiration which the wisdom and goodness of God inspires, when he is worshipped
                    in a temple not made with hands, and the world seems to contain only the mind
                    that formed and contemplates it! These are not the weak responses of ceremonial
                    devotion; nor to express them would the poet need another poetâs aid. No: his
                    heart burns within him, and he speaks the language of truth and nature, with
                    resistless energy. </p>
            <p> Inequalities, of course, are observable in his effusions; and a less vigorous
                    imagination, with more taste, would have produced more elegance and uniformity.
                    But as passages are softened or expunged, during the cooler moments of
                    reflection, the understanding is gratified at the expence of those involuntary
                    sensations which like the beauteous tints of an evening sky, are so evanescent
                    that they melt into new forms before they can be analysed. For, however
                    eloquently we may boast of our reason, man must often be delighted he cannot
                    tell why, or his blunt feelings are not made to relish the beauties which
                    nature, poetry, or any of the imitative arts afford. </p>
            <p> The imagery of the ancients appears naturally to have been borrowed from the
                    surrounding objects, and their mythology. When a hero is to be transported from
                    one place to another, across pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural as one
                    of the fleecy clouds, on which he has often gazed, scarcely conscious that he
                    wished to make it his chariot? Again; when nature seems to present obstacles to
                    his progress at almost every step, when the tangled forest and steep mountain
                    stand as barriers, to pass over which, the mind longs for supernatural aid; an
                    interposing deity, created by love or fear, who walks on the waves, and rules
                    the storm, severely felt in the first attempts to cultivate a country, will
                    receive from the impassioned fancy a local habitation and a name. </p>
            <p> It would be a philosophical enquiry, and throw some light on the history of the
                    human mind, to trace, as far as our information will allow us, the spontaneous
                    feelings and ideas which have produced the images that now frequently appear
                    unnatural, because they are remote, and disgusting, because they have been
                    servilely copied by poets, whose habits of thinking and views of nature must
                    have been different; for the understanding seldom disturbs the current of our
                    present feelings without dissipating the gay clouds which fancy has been
                    embracing; yet, it silently gives the colour to the whole tenor of them, and the
                    reverie is over when truth is grossly violated, or imagery introduced, selected
                    from books, and not from local manners, or popular prejudices. </p>
            <p> In a more advanced state of civilization, a poet is rather a creature of art
                    than nature; the books that he peruses in his youth, become a hot-bed, in which
                    artificial fruits are produced, beautiful to a common eye, though they want the
                    true hue and flavour. His images do not flow from his imagination, but are
                    servile copies; and, like the works of the painters who copy ancient statues
                    when they draw men and women of their own times, we acknowledge that the
                    features are fine, and the proportions just, but still they are men of stone:
                    insipid figures, that never convey to the mind the idea of a portrait taken from
                    the life, where the soul gives spirit and homogeneity to the whole form. The
                    silken wings of fancy are shrivelled by rules, and a desire of attaining
                    elegance of diction occasions an attention to words, incompatable with sublime
                    impassioned thoughts. </p>
            <p> A boy of abilities, who has been taught the structure of verse at school, and
                    been roused by emulation to compose rhymes whilst he was reading works of
                    genius, may, by practice, produce pretty verses, and even become what is often
                    termed an elegant poet; though his readers, without knowing well where the fault
                    lies, do not find themselves warmly interested. In the productions of the poets
                    who <pb n="281"/> fasten on their affections, they see grosser defects, and the
                    very images and allusions which shocked their taste; yet they do not appear as
                    puerile or extrinsic in one as the other. Why? Because they did not appear so to
                    the author. </p>
            <p> It may sound paradoxical, after observing that those productions want vigour
                    that are the work of imitation, in which the understanding violently directed,
                    if not extinguished, the blaze of fancy, to assert, that though genius be
                    allowed to be only another word for a strong imagination, the first observers of
                    nature exercised their judgment much more than their imitators. But they
                    exercised it to discriminate things, whilst their followers were busy borrowing
                    sentiments and arranging words. </p>
            <p> Boys who have received a classical education load their memory with words, and
                    the correspondent ideas are, perhaps, never distinctly comprehended. As a proof
                    of this assertion I must mention as a fact, that I have known many young people
                    who could write tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets prettily together,
                    when their prose themes showed the barrenness of their minds; or, more justly
                    speaking, how superficial the cultivation must have been, which their
                    understanding had received. </p>

               </hi> Not to stop to investigate the causes which produced this
                    happy strength of mind, it is sufficient to remark, that the world has agreed to
                    denominate those men of genius, who have pursued a particular art or science,
                    after the bent of nature has been displayed in obstinate perseverance or fond

            <p> But though it should be allowed that books conned at school may lead some youths
                    to write poetry, I fear they will never be the poets who charm our cares to
                    sleep, or extort admiration. They may diffuse taste, and polish the language,
                    but I am apt to conclude that they will seldom have the energy to rouse the
                    passions which amend the heart. </p>
            <p> And, to return to the first object of discussion, the reason why most people are
                    more interested by a scene described by a poet than by a view of nature,
                    probably arises from the want of a lively imagination. The poet contrasts the
                    prospect, and selecting the most picturesque parts in his camera, the judgment
                    is directed, and the whole attention of the languid faculty turned towards the
                    objects which excited the most forcible emotions in the poetâs heart, firing his
                    imagination; the reader consequently feels the enlivened description, though he
                    was not able to receive a first impression from the operations of his own mind. </p>
            <p> Besides, it may be farther observed, that uncultivated minds are only to be
                    moved by forcible representations. To rouse the thoughtless, objects must be
                    contrasted, calculated to excite tumultuous emotions. The unsubstantial
                    picturesque forms which a contemplative man gazes on, and often follows with
                    ardour till mocked by a glimpse of unattainable excellence, appear to them the
                    light vapours of a dreaming enthusiast, who gives up the substance for the
                    shadow. It is not within that they seek amusement â their eyes are rarely
                    turned back on themselves; of course, their emotions, though sometimes fervid,
                    are always transient, and the nicer perceptions which distinguish the man of
                    taste are not felt, or make such a slight impression as scarcely to excite any
                    pleasurable sensations. Is it surprising, then, that fine scenery is often
                    overlooked by those who yet may be delighted by the same imagery concentrated
                    and contrasted by the poet? But even this numerous class is exceeded by
                    witlings, who, anxious to appear to have wit and taste, do not allow their
                    understandings, or feelings, any liberty: for instead of cultivating their
                    faculties, and reflecting on their operations, they are busy collecting
                    prejudices, and are pre-determined to admire what the suffrage of time announces
                    excellent; not to store up a fund of amusement for themselves, but to enable
                    them to talk. </p>
            <p>These hints will assist the reader to trace some of the causes why the beauties
                    of nature are not forcibly felt, when civilization and its canker-worm, luxury,
                    have made considerable advances. Those calm emotions are not sufficiently lively
                    to serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary, or even for the moderate pursuers of
                    artificial pleasures. In the present state of society, the understanding must
                    bring back the feelings to nature, or the sensibility must have attained such
                    strength, as rather to be sharpened than <pb n="282"/> destroyed by the strong
                    exercise of passions. </p>
            <p> That the most valuable things are liable to the greatest perversion, is,
                    however, as trite as true. For the same sensibility, or quickness of senses,
                    which makes a man relish the charms of nature, when sensation, rather than
                    reason, imparts delight, frequently makes a libertine of him, by leading him to
                    prefer the tumult of love, a little refined by sentiment, to the calm pleasure
                    of affectionate friendship, in whose sober satisfactions reason, mixing her
                    tranquilizing convictions, whispers that content, not happiness, is the reward,
                    or consequence, of virtue in this world. </p>
