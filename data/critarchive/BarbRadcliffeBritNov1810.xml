               entitles its author to praise, a greater distinction is due to those which stand at
               the head of a class; and such are undoubtedly the novels of <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</ref>,—which exhibit a genius of
               no common stamp. She seems to scorn to move those passions which form the interest of
               common novels: she alarms the soul with terror; agitates it with suspense, prolonged
               and wrought up to the most intense feeling, by mysterious hints and obscure
               intimations of unseen danger. The scenery of her tales is in "time-shook towers,"<note><ref target="people.html#CarterElizabeth">Elizabeth Carter</ref>, "<title>Ode to
                     Wisdom</title>" 3 (1747).</note> vast uninhabited castles, winding stair-cases,
               long echoing aisles; or, if abroad, lonely heaths, gloomy forests, and abrupt
               precipices, the haunt of banditti;—the canvass and the figures of <ref target="people.html#RosaSalvatore">Salvator Rosa</ref>. Her living characters
               correspond to the scenery:—their wicked projects are dark, singular, atrocious. They
               are not of English growth; their guilt is tinged with a darker hue than that of the
               bad and profligate characters we see in the world about us; they seem almost to
               belong to an unearthly sphere of powerful mischief. But to the terror <lb/><fw type="vol"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. xliii.</hi></fw><fw type="sig">a</fw><pb n="ii"/>produced by the machinations of guilt, and the perception of danger, this
               writer has had the art to unite another, and possibly a stronger feeling. There is,
               perhaps, in every breast at all susceptible of the influence of imagination, the germ
               of a certain superstitious dread of the world unknown, which easily suggests the
               ideas of commerce with it. Solitude, darkness, low-whispered sounds, obscure glimpses
               of objects, flitting forms, tend to raise in the mind that thrilling, mysterious
               terror, which has for its object the "powers unseen and mightier far than we."<note><ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Alexander Pope</ref>, <title><hi rendition="#italics">Essay on Man</hi></title> III, 251-2, slightly altered.</note> But these ideas are suggested only;
               for it is the peculiar management of this author, that, though she gives, as it were,
               a glimpse of the world of terrible shadows, she yet stops short of any thing really
               supernatural: for all the strange and alarming circumstances brought forward in the
               narrative are explained in the winding up of the story by natural causes; but in the
               mean time the reader has felt their full impression.</p><p>The first production of this lady, in which her peculiar genius was strikingly
               developed, is <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Romance of the Forest</hi></title>, and in some respects it is perhaps the best.<note>This 1795 novel is
                  actually Radcliffe's third. While Barbauld might almost be justified in ignoring
                  Radcliffe's first, <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne</hi></title> (1789), readers usually regard the 1790 <title><hi rendition="#italics">A Sicilian Romance</hi></title> as a work of merit. Since Barbauld seems to confuse the title of <title><hi rendition="#italics">A Sicilian Romance</hi></title> with that of <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Italian</hi></title> (see below), perhaps this confusion explains the omission.</note> It
               turns upon the machinations of a profligate villain and his agent against an amiable
               and unprotected girl, whose birth and fortunes have been involved in obscurity by
               crime and perfidy. The character of La Motte, the agent, is drawn with spirit. He is
               represented as weak and timid, gloomy and arbitrary in his family, drawn by
               extravagance into vice and atrocious actions; capable of remorse, but not capable of
               withstanding temptation. There is a <pb n="iii"/>scene between him and the more
               hardened marquis, who is tempting him to commit murder, which has far more nature and
               truth than the admired scene between King John and Hubert, in which the writer's
               imagination has led him rather to represent the action to which the king is
               endeavouring to work his instrument, as it would be seen by a person who had a great
               horror of its guilt, than in the manner in which he ought to represent it in order to
               win him to his purpose: <quote><lg type="stanza"><l rendition="#indent8">—————If the midnight bell</l><l>Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth </l><l>Sound one unto the drowsy ear of night, </l><l>If this same were a churchyard where we stand, </l><l>And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs, </l><l>———— if thou couldst see me without eyes, </l><l>Hear me without thine ears, and make reply </l><l>Without a tongue, &amp;c.<note><ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespeare</ref>'s <title><hi rendition="#italics">King John</hi></title> III.iii.37-50, the first five lines of which serve as part of an
                           epigraph to Chapter 14 of <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Romance of the Forest</hi></title>. Radcliffe’s epigraph continues with the lines that Barbauld
                           here deletes.</note></l></lg></quote>What must be the effect of such imagery, but to infuse into the mind of
               Hubert that horror of the crime with which the spectator views the deed, and which it
               was the business, indeed, of <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</ref> to impress upon the mind of the spectator, but not of King John
               to impress upon Hubert? In the scene referred to, on the other hand, the Marquis,
               whose aim is to tempt La Motte to the commission of murder, begins by attempting to
               lower his sense of virtue, by representing it as the effect of prejudices imbibed in
               early youth; reminds him that in many countries the stiletto is resorted to without
               scruple; treats as trivial his former deviations from integrity; and, by lulling his
               conscience and awakening his cupidity, draws him to his purpose. </p><lb/><fw type="sig">a 2</fw><pb n="iv"/><p> There are many situations in this novel which strike strongly upon the imagination.
               Who can read without a shudder, that Adeline in her lonely chamber at the abbey
               hardly dared to lift her eyes to the glass, lest she should see another face than her
               own reflected from it? or who does not sympathize with her feelings, when, thinking
               she has effected her escape with Peter, she hears a strange voice, and finds herself
               on horseback in a dark night carried away by an unknown ruffian?</p><p> The next work which proceeded from <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.
                  Radcliffe</ref>'s pen was <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Mysteries of Udolpho</hi></title>. Similar to the former in the turn of its incidents, and the nature of the
               feelings it is meant to excite, it abounds still more with instances of mysterious
               and terrific appearances, but has perhaps less of character, and a more imperfect
               story. It has been the aim in this work to assemble appearances of the most
               impressive kind, which continually present the idea of supernatural agency, but which
               are at length accounted for by natural means. They are not always, however, <hi rendition="#italics">well</hi> accounted for; and the mind experiences a sort of
               disappointment and shame at having felt so much from appearances which had nothing in
               them beyond "this visible diurnal sphere."<note><ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref>, <title><hi rendition="#italics">Paradise Lost</hi></title> Bk. 7, 22.</note> The moving of the pall in the funereal chamber is of
               this nature. The curtain which no one dares to undraw, interests us strongly; we feel
               the utmost stings and throbs of curiosity; but we have been affected so repeatedly,
               the suspense has been so long protracted, and expectation raised so high, that no
                  ex-<pb n="v"/>planation can satisfy, no imagery of horrors can equal the vague
               shapings of our imagination.</p><p> The story of <title><hi rendition="#italics">Udolpho</hi></title> is more complicated and perplexed than that of <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Romance of the Forest</hi></title><hi rendition="#italics">;</hi> but it turns, like that, on the terrors and dangers
               of a young lady confined in a castle. The character of her oppressor, Montoni, is
               less distinctly marked than that of La Motte; and it is a fault in the story, that
               its unravelling depends but little on the circumstances that have previously engaged
               our attention. Another castle is introduced; wonders are multiplied upon us; and the
               interest we had felt in the castle of Udolpho in the Appenines, is suddenly
               transferred to Chateau le Blanc among the Pyrenees.</p><p><title><hi rendition="#italics">The Mysteries of Udolpho</hi></title> is the most popular of this author's performances, and as such has been
               chosen for this Selection; but perhaps it is exceeded in strength by her next
               publication, <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Sicilian</hi></title>.<note>Barbauld describes <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Italian</hi></title> (1797). Radcliffe never wrote a novel called <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Sicilian.</hi></title></note> Nothing can be finer than the opening of this story. An Englishman on his
               travels, walking through a church, sees a dark figure stealing along the aisles. He
               is informed that he is an assassin. On expressing his astonishment that he should
               find shelter there, he is told that such adventures are common in Italy. His
               companion then points to a confessional in an obscure aisle of the church. "There,"
               says he, "in that cell, such a tale of horror was once poured into the ear of a
               priest as overwhelmed him with astonishment, nor was the secret ever disclosed." This
               prelude, like the tuning of an instrument by a skilful hand, has the effect of
               producing at once in the mind a tone of feeling cor-<pb n="vi"/>respondent to the
               future story. In this, as in the former productions, the curiosity of the reader is
               kept upon the stretch by mystery and wonder. The author seems perfectly to understand
               that obscurity, as <ref target="people.html#BurkeEdmund">Burke</ref> has asserted, is
               a strong ingredient in the sublime:—a face shrowded in a cowl; a narrative suddenly
               suspended; deep guilt half revealed; the untold secrets of a prison-house; the
               terrific shape, "if shape it might be called, that shape had none
               distinguishable;"—all these affect the mind more powerfully than any regular or
               distinct images of danger or of woe.<note>In <title><hi rendition="#italics">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas
                        of the Sublime and Beautiful</hi></title>, <ref target="people.html#BurkeEdmund">Edmund Burke</ref> stressed
                  obscurity as a critical characteristic of the sublime. <ref target="people.html#BurkeEdmund">Burke</ref>'s work helped bring new
                  respectability to Gothic literature and formed a standard in British aesthetics
                  through the Romantic period and beyond. The quotation from <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref>'s description of Death in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Paradise Lost</hi></title> (Bk. II, 667) serves Burke as one of the most powerful examples of the
                  effect of obscurity in producing ideas of the sublime.</note></p><p> But this novel has also high merit in the character of Schedoni, which is strikingly
               drawn, as is his personal appearance. "His figure," says the author, "was striking,
               but not so from grace. It was tall, and though extremely thin, his limbs were large
               and uncouth; and as he stalked along, wrapped in the black garments of his order,
               there was something terrible in his air, something almost superhuman. His cowl too,
               as it threw a shade over the livid paleness of his face, increased its severe
               character, and gave an effect to his large melancholy eye which approached to horror.
               His physiognomy bore the trace of many passions, which seemed to have fixed the
               features they no longer animated. His eyes were so piercing that they seemed to
               penetrate with a single glance into the hearts of men, and to read their most secret
               thoughts; few persons could support their scrutiny, or even endure to meet them
               twice." A striking figure for the painter to transfer to the canvass; perhaps some
                  <pb n="vii"/>picture might originally have suggested it. The scene where this
               singular character is on the point of murdering his own daughter, as she then appears
               to be, is truly tragical, and wrought up with great strength and pathos. It is
               impossible not to be interested in the situation of Ellen, in the convent, when her
               lamp goes out while she is reading a paper on which her fate depends; and again when,
               in making her escape, she has just got to the end of the long vaulted passage, and
               finds the door locked, and herself betrayed. The scenes of the Inquisition are too
               much protracted, and awaken more curiosity than they fully gratify; perhaps than any
               story can gratify.</p><p> In novels of this kind, where the strong charm of suspense and mystery is employed,
               we hurry through with suspended breath, and in a kind of agony of expectation; but
               when we are come to the end of the story, the charm is dissolved, we have no wish to
               read it again; we do not recur to it as we do to the characters of Western in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Tom Jones</hi></title>,<note>1749 novel by <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Henry
                     Fielding</ref>.</note> or the Harrels in <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Cecilia</title>;</hi><note>1782 novel by <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Fanny Burney</ref>.</note>
               the interest is painfully strong while we read, and when once we have read it, it is
               nothing; we are ashamed of our feelings, and do not wish to recall them.</p><p> There are beauties in <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</ref>'s
               volumes, which would perhaps have more effect if our curiosity were less excited,—for
               her descriptions are rich and picturesque. Switzerland, the south of France, Venice,
               the valleys of Piedmont, the bridge, the cataract, and especially the charming bay of
               Naples, the dances of the peasants, with the vine-dressers and the fishermen, <pb n="viii"/>have employed her pencil. Though love is but of a secondary interest in
               her story, there is a good deal of tenderness in the parting scenes between Emily and
               Valancourt in <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Mysteries of Udolpho</hi></title>, when she dismisses him, who is still the object of her tenderness, on
               account of his irregularities.</p><p> It ought not to be forgotten that there are many elegant pieces of poetry
               interspersed through the volumes of <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.
                  Radcliffe</ref>; among which are to be distinguished as exquisitely sweet and
               fanciful, the <title><hi rendition="#italics">Song to a Spirit</hi></title>, and <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Sea Nymph</hi></title>, "Down down a hundred fathom deep!"<note>The first line of the poem "The Sea
                  Nymph," which appears in Chapter II of <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Mysteries of Udolpho</hi></title> is "Down, down a thousand fathom deep,".</note> They might be sung by
                  <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</ref>'s Ariel. The true
               lovers of poetry are almost apt to regret its being brought in as an accompaniment to
               narrative, where it is generally neglected; for not one in a hundred, of those who
               read and can judge of novels, are at all able to appreciate the merits of a copy of
               verses, and the common reader is always impatient to get on with the story.</p><p><title><hi rendition="#italics">The Sicilian</hi></title> is the last of <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</ref>'s
