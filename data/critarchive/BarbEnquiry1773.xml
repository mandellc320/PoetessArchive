               <hi rendition="#largest">I</hi>t is undoubtedly true,
                    though a phÃ¦nomenon of the human mind difficult to account for, that the
                    representation of distress frequently gives pleasure; from <pb n="191"/>which
                    general observation many of our modern writers of tragedy and romance seem to
                    have drawn this inference, that in order to please they have nothing more to do
                    than to paint distress in natural and striking colours. With this view, they
                    heap together all the afflicting events and dismal accidents their imagination
                    can furnish; and when they have half broke the reader's heart, they expect
                    he should thank them for his agreeable entertainment. An author of this class
                    sits down, pretty much like an inquisitor, to compute how much suffering he can
                    inflict upon the hero of his tale before he makes an end of him: with this
                    difference, indeed, that the inquisitor only tortures those who are at least
                    reputed criminals; whereas the writer generally chooses the most excellent
                    character in his piece for the subject of his persecution. The great criterion
                    of excellence is placed in being <pb n="192"/>able to draw tears plentifully;

                    of a new pleasure; but if any one could find out a new torture, or non-descript

                    a more delicate hand; and it is far from being true that we are agreeably
                    affected by every thing that excites our sympathy. It shall therefore be the
                    business of this Essay to distinguish those kinds of distress which are pleasing
                    in the <pb n="193"/>representation, from those which are really painful and
                    disgusting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">The</hi> view or relation of mere misery can never be
                    pleasing. We have, indeed, a strong sympathy with all kinds of misery; but it is
                    a feeling of pure unmixed pain, similar in kind, though not equal in degree to
                    what we feel for ourselves on the like occasions; and never produces that
                    melting sorrow, that thrill of tenderness, to which we give the name of pity.
                    They are two distinct sensations, marked by very different external expression.
                    One causes the nerves to tingle, the flesh to shudder, and the whole countenance
                    to be thrown into strong contractions; the other relaxes the frame, opens the
                    features, and produces tears. When we crush a noxious or loathsome animal, we
                    may sympathize strongly with the pain it suffers, but with far different

                            he had been so changed during his twenty year absence that he was
                            recognized only by his old and faithful nurse Eurycleia, who noticed a
                            familiar scar while bathing his feet, and by his dog Argus, who jumped
                            up for joy and died.</note>
               </hi> Extreme bodily pain is perhaps the most
                    intense suffering we are capable of, and if the fellow feeling with misery alone
                    was grateful to the mind, the exhibition of a man in a fit of the tooth-ach, or
                    under a chirurgical operation, would have a fine effect in a tragedy. But there
                    must be some other sentiment combined with this kind of instinctive sympathy,
                    before it becomes in any degree pleasing, or produces the sweet emotion of pity.
                    This sentiment is love, esteem, the complacency we take in the contemplation of
                    beauty, of mental or moral excellence, called forth and rendered more
                    interesting, by circumstances of pain and danger. Tenderness is, much more
                    properly than sorrow, the spring of tears; for it affects us in that manner <pb n="195"/>whether combined with joy or grief; perhaps more in the former case
                    than the latter. And I believe we may venture to assert, that no distress which
                    produces tears is wholly without a mixture of pleasure. When Joseph's
                    brethren were sent to buy corn, if they had perished in the desart by wild

                    feelings, that no scenes of misery ought to be exhibited which are not connected
                    with the display of some moral excellence or agreeable quality. If fortitude,
                    power, and strength of mind are called forth, they produce the sublime feelings
                    of wonder and admiration: if the softer qualities of gentleness, grace, and
                    beauty, they inspire love and pity. The management of these latter emotions is
                    our present object.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">And</hi> let it be remembered, in the first place, that
                    the misfortunes which excite pity must not be too horrid and overwhelming. The
                    mind is rather stunned than softened by great calamities. They are little
                    circumstances that work most <pb n="197"/>sensibly upon the tender feelings. For
                    this reason, a well-written novel generally draws more tears than a tragedy. The
                    distresses of tragedy are more calculated to amaze and terrify, than to move
                    compassion. Battles, torture and death are in every page. The dignity of the
                    characters, the importance of the events, the pomp of verse and imagery interest
                    the grander passions, and raise the mind to an enthusiasm little favourable to
                    the weak and languid notes of pity. The tragedies of <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Young</ref> are in a fine strain of poetry,
                    and the situations are worked up with great energy, but the pictures are in too
                    deep a shade: all his pieces are full of violent and gloomy passions, and so
                    over-wrought with horror, that instead of awakening any pleasing sensibility,
                    they leave on the mind an impression of sadness mixed with terror. <ref target="people.html.#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</ref> is sometimes

                    extremely capable of raising tenderness, he continually checks its course by
                    shocking and disagreeable expressions. His pieces are in the same taste with the
                    pictures of <ref target="people.html#RiberaJusepe">Spagnolet</ref>, and there
                    are many scenes in his tragedies which no one can relish who would not look with
                    pleasure on the flaying of St. Bartholomew. The following speech of

                    too free with the more violent expressions of passion and distress, by which
                    means they lose their effect. Thus an ordinary author does not know how to
                    express any strong emotion otherwise than by swoonings or death; so that a
                    person experienced in this kind of reading, when a girl faints away at parting
                    with her lover, or a hero kills himself for the loss of his mistress, considers

               <pb n="200"/>etiquette upon such occasions, and turns over the pages with
                    the utmost coolness and unconcern; whereas real sensibility and a more intimate
                    knowledge of human nature would have suggested a thousand little touches of
                    grief, which though slight are irresistible. We are too gloomy a people. Some of
                    the French novels are remarkable for little affecting incidents, imagined with
                    delicacy and told with grace. Perhaps they have a better turn than we for this

               <hi rendition="#smcaps">A judicious</hi> author will never attempt to raise pity

                    nothing, therefore, must be admitted which destroys the grace and dignity of
                    suffering; the imagination must have an amiable figure to <pb n="201"/>dwell

               <pb n="202"/> Deformity is always disgusting, and the imagination cannot
                    reconcile it with the idea of a favourite character; therefore the poet and
                    romance-writer are fully justified in giving a larger share of beauty to their
                    principal figures than is usually met with in common life. A late genius,
                    indeed, in whimsical mood, gave us a lady with her nose crushed for the heroine

                    suffering which rend the heart, in poverty, in a prison, under the most shocking
                    outrages, the grace and delicacy of her character never suffers even for a
                    moment: there seems to be a charm about her which prevents her receiving a stain
                    from any thing which happens; and <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, abandoned and undone, is the object not only of
                    complacence, but veneration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">I would</hi> likewise observe, that if an author would
                    have us feel a strong degree of compassion, his characters must not be too
                    perfect. The stern fortitude and inflexible resolution of a <ref target="people.html#Cato">Cato</ref> may command esteem, but does not excite
                    tenderness; and faultless rectitude of conduct, though no rigour be mixed with
                    it, is of too sublime a nature to inspire compassion. Virtue has a kind of
                        self-suffi-<pb n="207"/>ciency; it stands upon its own basis, and cannot be
                    injured by any violence. It must therefore be mixed with something of
                    helplessness and imperfection, with an excessive sensibility, or a simplicity
                    bordering upon weakness, before it raises, in any great degree, either
                    tenderness or familiar love. If there be a fault in the masterly performance
                    just now mentioned, it is that the character of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> is so inflexibly right,
                    her passions are under such perfect command, and her prudence is so equal to
                    every occasion, that she seems not to need that sympathy we should bestow upon
                    one of a less elevated character: and perhaps we should feel a livelier emotion

               <hi rendition="#smcaps">Pity</hi> seems too degrading a sentiment to be offered
                    at the shrine of faultless excellence. The sufferings of martyrs are rather
                    beheld with admiration and sympathetic triumph than with tears; and we never
                    feel much for those whom we consider as themselves raised above common
                    feelings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">The</hi> last rule I shall insist upon is, that scenes of
                    distress should not be too long continued. All our finer feelings are in a
                    manner momentary, and no art can carry them beyond a certain point, either in
                    intenseness or duration. Constant suffering deadens the heart to tender
                    impressions; as we many observe in sailors, and others who are grown callous by
                    a life of continual hardships. It is therefore highly necessary in a long work
                    to relieve the mind by scenes of pleasure and gaiety: and I cannot think it so
                    ab- <pb n="209"/>surd a practice as our modern delicacy has represented it, to
                    intermix wit and fancy with the pathetic, provided care be taken not to check
                    the passions while they are flowing. The transition from a pleasurable state of
                    mind to tender sorrow is not so difficult as we imagine. When the mind is opened
                    by gay and agreeable scenes, every impression is felt more sensibly. Persons of
                    lively temper are much more susceptible of that sudden swell of sensibility
                    which occasions tears, than those of a grave and saturnine cast: for this reason
                    women are more easily moved to weeping than men. Those who have touched the
                    springs of pity with the finest hand have mingled light strokes of pleasantry
                    and mirth in their most pathetic passages. Very different is the conduct of many
                    novel writers, who by plunging us into scenes of distress without end or limit,
                    exhaust the powers, <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">P</fw>
               <pb n="210"/>and before the conclusion either render us insensible to every
                    thing, or fix a real sadness upon the mind. The uniform stile of tragedies is
                    one reason why they affect so little. In our old plays all the force of language
                    is reserved for the more interesting parts; and in the scenes of common life
                    there is no attempt to rise above common language: whereas we, by that pompous
                    manner and affected solemnity which we think it necessary to preserve through
                    the whole piece, lose the force of an elevated or passionate expression where
                    the occasion really suggests it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">Having</hi> thus considered the manner in which
                    fictitious distress must be managed to render it pleasing, let us reflect a
                    little upon the moral tendency of such representations. Much has been said in
                    favour of them, and they are generally <pb n="211"/>thought to improve the
                    tender and humane feelings; but this, I own, appears to me very dubious. That
                    they exercise sensibility is true, but sensibility does not increase with
                    exercise. By the constitution of our frame our habits increase, our emotions
                    decrease, by repeated acts; and thus a wise provision is made, that as our
                    compassion grows weaker, its place should be supplied by habitual benevolence.
                    But in these writings our sensibility is strongly called forth without any
                    possibility of exerting itself in virtuous action, and those emotions, which we
                    shall never feel again with equal force, are wasted without advantage. Nothing
                    is more dangerous than to let virtuous impressions of any kind pass through the
                    mind without producing their proper effect. The awakenings of remorse, virtuous
                    shame and indignation, the glow of moral approba- <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">P 2</fw>
               <pb n="212"/>tion, if they do not lead
                    to action, grow less and less vivid every time they recur, till at length the
                    mind grows absolutely callous. The being affected with a pathetic story is
                    undoubtedly a sign of an amiable disposition, but perhaps no means of increasing
                    it. On the contrary, young people, by a course of this kind of reading, often
                    acquire something of that apathy and indifference which the experience of real
                    life would have given them, without its advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">Another</hi> reason why plays and romances do not improve
                    our humanity is, that they lead us to require a certain elegance of manners and
                    delicacy of virtue which is not often found with poverty, ignorance, and
                    meanness. The objects of pity in romance are as different from those in real
                    life as our husbandmen from <pb n="213"/>the shepherds of Arcadia; and a girl
                    who will sit weeping the whole night at the delicate distresses of a lady
                    Charlotte or lady Julia, shall be little moved at the complaint of her
                    neighbour, who, in a homely phrase and vulgar accent, laments to her that she is
                    not able to get bread for her family. Romance-writers likewise make great
                    misfortunes so familiar to our ears, that we have hardly any pity to spare for
                    the common accidents of life: but we ought to remember, that misery has a claim
                    to relief, however we may be disgusted with its appearance; and that we must not
                    fancy ourselves charitable, when we are only pleasing our imagination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">It</hi> would perhaps be better, if our romances were
                    more like those of the old stamp, which tended to raise human nature, and
                    inspire a certain grace and dig- <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">P 3</fw>
               <pb n="214"/>nity of manners of which we have hardly the
                    idea. The high notions of honour, the wild and fanciful spirit of adventure and
                    romantic love, elevated the mind; our novels tend to depress and enfeeble it.
                    Yet there is a species of this kind of writing which must ever afford an
                    exquisite pleasure to persons of taste and sensibility; where noble sentiments
                    are mixed with well-fancied incidents, pathetic touches with dignity and grace,
                    and invention with chaste correctness. Such will ever interest our sweetest
                    passions. I shall conclude this paper with the following tale.</p>

            <p rendition="#center">____________</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#largest">I</hi>N the happy period of the golden age, when all the
                    celestial inhabitants descended to the earth, and conversed familiarly with
                    mortals, among the most cherished of the heavenly powers were twins, the
                    offspring of Jupiter, <hi rendition="#smcaps">love</hi> and <hi rendition="#smcaps">joy</hi>. Wherever they appeared, the flowers sprung up
                    beneath their feet, the sun shone with a brighter radiance, and all nature
                    seemed embellished by their presence. They were inseparable companions, and
                    their growing attachment was favoured by Jupiter, who had decreed that a lasting
                    union should be solemnized between them so soon as they were arrived at maturer
                    years. But in the mean time the sons of men deviated <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">P 4</fw>
               <pb n="216"/>from their native
                    innocence; vice and ruin over-ran the earth with giant strides; and <ref target="people.html#Astraea">Astrea</ref> with her train of celestial
                    visitants forsook their polluted abodes. Love alone remained, having been stolen
                    away by Hope, who was his nurse, and conveyed by her to the forests of Arcadia,
                    where he was brought up among the shepherds. But Jupiter assigned him a
                    different partner, and commanded him to espouse <hi rendition="#smcaps">sorrow</hi>, the daughter of <ref target="people.html#Ate">AtÃ©</ref>.
                    He complied with reluctance; for her features were harsh and disagreeable, her
                    eyes sunk, her forehead contracted into perpetual wrinkles, and her temples were
                    covered with a wreath of cypress and wormwood. From this union sprung a virgin,
                    in whom might be traced a strong resemblance to both her parents; but the sullen
                    and unamiable features of her mother were so <pb n="217"/>mixed and blended with
                    the sweetness of her father, that her countenance, though mournful, was highly
                    pleasing. The maids and shepherds of the neighbouring plains gathered round and
                    called her <hi rendition="#smcaps">pity</hi>. A red-breast was observed to build
                    in the cabin where she was born; and while she was yet an infant, a dove pursued
                    by a hawk flew into her bosom. This nymph had a dejected appearance, but so soft
                    and gentle a mien that she was beloved to a degree of enthusiasm. Her voice was
                    low and plaintive, but inexpressibly sweet; and she loved to lie for hours
                    together on the banks of some wild and melancholy stream, singing to her lute.
                    She taught men to weep, for she took a strange delight in tears; and often, when
                    the virgins of the hamlet were assembled at their evening sports, she would
                    steal in amongst them, and <pb n="218"/>captivate their hearts by her tales full
                    of a charming sadness. She wore on her head a garland composed of her
                    father's myrtles twisted with her mother's cypress.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#smcaps">One</hi> day, as she sat musing by the waters of
                    Helicon, her tears by chance fell into the fountain; and ever since, the
                    Muses' spring has retained a strong taste of the infusion. Pity was
                    commanded by Jupiter to follow the steps of her mother through the world,
                    dropping balm into the wounds she made, and binding up the hearts she had
                    broken. She follows with her hair loose, her bosom bare and throbbing, her
                    garments torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding with the roughness of the
                    path. The nymph is mortal, for her mother is so; and when she has fulfilled her
                        <pb n="219"/>destined course upon the earth, they shall both expire
                    together, and <hi rendition="#smcaps">love</hi> be again united to <hi rendition="#smcaps">joy</hi>, his immortal and long betrothed bride.</p>
