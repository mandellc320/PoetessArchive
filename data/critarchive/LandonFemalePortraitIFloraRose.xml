               there is something narrow in the idea of a school, and his influence has been
               universal. Indeed, there is no such thing as a school in literature; each great
               writer is his own original, and "none but himself can be his parallel."<note>A phrase

               Parnassus is the very reverse of Mont Blanc.<note>In Greek mythology, Parnassus is
                  the mountain which is home to the Muses and considered the source of poetry and
                  music and is therefore associated with classical literature and aesthetics. Mont

                  drew inspiration for their writings, particularly through their famous ghost story
                  contest. Associated with the Romantic movement, the mountain is referenced in the
                  works of the former three, most notably in <ref target="people.html#ShelleyMary">Mary Shelley</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Frankenstein</title></hi>.</note> There the summit is gained by treading closely in the steps of the
               guides; but in the first, the height is only to be reached by a pathway of our own.
               The influence of a genius like <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s is
               shown by the fresh and new spirit he pours into literature.</p><p>No merely literary man ever before exercised the power over his age exercised by <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>. It is curious to note the wealth
               circulated through his means, and the industry and intelligence to which he gave the
               impetus. The innkeepers of Scotland ought to have no sign but his head. When
                  <title>Waverley</title> appeared, a tour through Scotland was an achievement: now,
               how few there are but have passed an autumn at least amid its now classic scenery. I
               own it gave my picturesque fancies at first a shock, to hear of a steam-boat on Loch
               Katrine; but I was wrong. Nothing could be a more decisive proof of the increased
               communication between England and Scotland—and communication is the regal road to
               improvement of every kind. How many prejudices have floated away on the tremulous
               line of vapour following the steam-vessel; and what a store of poetical enjoyment
               must the voyagers have carried home! More than one touch of that sly humour, which
               seems to me peculiarly and solely marking the <hi rendition="#italics">Scotch</hi>,
               has been bestowed on the cockney invaders of the "land of brown heath and shaggy

               sympathy with, the longing for green fields which haunts the dweller in towns. The
               secret dream of almost every inhabitant in those dusky streets where even a fresh
               thought would scarcely seem to enter, is to realise an independence, and go and live
               in the country. Where is every holiday spent but in the country! What do the smoky
               geraniums, so carefully tended in many a narrow street and blind alley attest, but
               the inherent love of the country! To whom do the blooming and sheltered villas, which
               are a national feature in English landscape, belong, but to men who pass the greater
               part of their lives in small dim counting-houses! This love of nature is divinely
               given to keep alive, even in the most toiling and world-worn existence, something of
               the imaginative and the apart. It is a positive good quality; and one <lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">d 2</hi></fw><pb n="36"/>good quality has some direct, or indirect tendency to produce another. It

               this love of the country, and of idealising it into a love of the picturesque. Who
               can wonder then, that when such descriptions came accompanied with all the
               associations of romance—all the interest of stirring narrative—that a visit to
               "Caledonia, stern and wild,"<note><ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Lay of the Last Minstrel</title></hi>, canto VI, stanza II, line 17.</note> became the day-dream of all who looked
               to their summer excursion as the delight and reward of the year. I have never visited
               Scotland—in all human probability I never shall; but were a fairy, that pleasant
               remover of all ordinary difficulties, to give me the choice of what country I wished
               to see, my answer would be—Scotland; and that solely to realise the pictures, which
               reading <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> has made part of my
               memory.</p><p>Another noticeable fact is, the number of books which have grown out of the
                  <title>Waverley</title> novels.<note>The long series of novels that began with
                     <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s anonymous publication of
                     <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since</title></hi>. The subsequent novels appeared under the sobriquet "By the Author of <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Waverley</title></hi>."</note> How many local and antiquarian tomes have brought forth a world of
               curious and attractive information, in which no one before took an interest! And here
               I may be allowed to allude to the prejudice, for such it is, that the historical
               novel is likely to be taken for, and to interfere with history. Not such novels as
                  <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> wrote, certainly. In the first
               place, his picture of the time is as exact as it is striking: the reader must
               inevitably add to his stock of knowledge, as well as of amusement: he must acquire a
               general notion of the time; its good and its evil are brought in a popular shape
               before him; while the estimate of individual character is as true as it is forcible.
               Secondly, there must be something inherently vacant and unproductive in the mind
               which his pages stimulate to no further inquiry.</p><p>In such hands it would be of little consequence whether a fictitious or an actual
               chronicle were placed—either would lead to no result. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s works have done more towards
               awakening a rational curiosity, than a whole world of catechisms and abridgments
               would ever have accomplished. History has been read owing to his stimulus.</p><p>Prose fiction was at its lowest ebb when <title>Waverley</title> appeared. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> gives in his preface a most amusing
               picture of the supply then in the market: a castle was no castle without a ghost, or
               at least what seemed one till the last chapter, and the heroine was a less actual
               creation than the harp which ever accompanied her. These heroines were always
               faultless: the heroes were divided into two classes; either as perfect as their
               impossible mistresses, or else rakes who were reformed in the desperate extremity of
               a third volume. <title>Waverley</title> must have taken the populace of novel readers
               quite by surprise: there is in its pages the germ of every excellence, afterwards so
               fully developed—the description, like a painting; the skill in giving the quaint and
               peculiar in character; the dramatic narrative, and above all, that tone of romance
               before unknown to English prose literature. Flora M'Ivor is the first conception of
               female character in which the highly imaginative is the element.</p><p>Perhaps we must except the <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> of
                  <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>—a poetical <pb n="37"/>creation, which only genius could have conceived amid the formal and narrow-motived
               circle which surrounded her. Clarissa is more domestic and pathetic; though in the
               whole range of our dramatic poetry, so fertile in touching situation, there is
               nothing more heart-rending than the visit of her cousin to her in the last volume. He
               finds the happy and blooming girl whom he left the idol of her home circle,
               accustomed to affection and attention, surrounded by cheerful pleasures and graceful
               duties—he finds her in a miserable lodging, among strangers, faded, heart-broken, and
               for daily employ making her shroud. A French critic says: "Even <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> himself did not dare hazard
               making Clarissa in love with his hero."<note>Probably <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>, whose <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Sketches of English Literature</title></hi> (1836) Landon had reviewed two years earlier.</note><ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had far too fine a
               perception of character to do any such thing. What was there in <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> that Clarissa should love him? He is
               witty; but wit is the last quality to excite passion, or to secure affection. Liberty
               is the element of love; and from the first he surrounds her with restraint, and
               inspires her with distrust. Moreover, he makes no appeal to the generosity of her
               nature; and to interest those generous feelings, so active in the feminine
               temperament, is the first step in gaining the citadel of her heart. To have loved,
               would not have detracted one touch from the delicate colouring of Clarissa's
               character; to have loved a man like <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>
               would. In nothing, more than in attachment is "the nature subdued to what it works

               when the young men of birth and fortune had no sphere of activity but the camp; all

               exception in our stirring country, where pursuits and responsibility are in the lot
               of all. They may, however, be noted as proofs that where the political standard is
               low, the moral standard will be still lower.</p><p>Excepting, therefore, the impassioned Italian of <title>Sir Charles
               Grandison</title>, Flora M'Ivor is the first female character of our novels in which
               poetry is the basis of the composition. She has all <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementine</ref> wants; picturesque accessories,
               and the strong moral purpose. Generally speaking, the mind of a woman is developed by
               the heart; the being is incomplete till love brings out either its strength or its
               weakness. This is not the case with the beautiful Highlander; and <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> is the first who has drawn a heroine,
               and put the usual master-passion aside. We believe few women go down to the grave
               without at some time or other feeling the full force of the affections. Flora, had
               not her career been cut short in the very fulness of its flower, would have loved,
               loved with all the force of a character formed before it loved. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s picture is, at the time when she is
               introduced, as full of truth as of beauty. The strong mind has less immediate need of
               an object than the weak one. Rose Bradwardine falls in love at once, compelled by
               "the sweet necessity of loving." Flora M'Ivor feels no such necessity; her
               imagination is occupied; her on-lookings to the future, excited by the fortunes of
               the ill-fated House to which her best sympathies and most earnest hopes are given.
               The House of Stuart<note><hi rendition="#italics"><title>Waverly</title></hi> depicts the 1745 Jacobite Uprising, in which Scottish forces supported the

                  posed a serious threat to the English throne, the Scottish forces were ultimately

               her sense of justice and of generosity on its side; it is connected with the legends
               of her earliest years; she is impelled towards it with true female adherence to the
               unfortunate. Moreover, her affections have already an object in her <pb n="38"/>brother. There is no attachment stronger, more unselfish, than the love between
               brother and sister, thrown on the world orphans at an early age, with none to love
               them save each other. They feel how much they stand alone, and this draws them more
               together. Constant intercourse has given that perfect understanding which only
               familiarity can do; hopes, interests, sorrows, are alike in common. Each is to either
               a source of pride; it is the tenderness of love without its fears, and the confidence
               of marriage, without its graver and more anxious character. The fresh impulses of
               youth are all warm about the heart.</p><p>It would have been an impossibility for Flora to have attached herself to Edward
               Waverley. A woman must look up to love: she may deceive herself, but she must
               devoutly believe in the superiority of her lover. With one so constituted as
               Flora—proud, high-minded, with that tendency to idealise inseparable from the
               imagination, Flora must have admired before she could have loved. The object of her
               attachment must have had something to mark him out from "the undistinguishable
                  many."<note>From <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuel">Coleridge</ref>'s

                  IV.</note> Now, Edward Waverley is just like nine-tenths of our acquaintance, or
               at least what they seem to us—pleasant, amiable, and gentlemanlike, but without one
               atom of the picturesque or the poetical about them. Flora is rather the idol of his
               imagination than of his heart, and it might well be made a question whether he be
               most in love with the rocky torrent, the Highland harp, the Gaelic ballad, or the
               lovely singer. They would have been unhappy had they married. Flora's decision of
               temper would have deepened into harshness, when placed in the unnatural position of
               exercising it for a husband; while Edward would have had too much quickness of
               perception not to know the influence to which he submitted—he would have been
               mortified even while too indolent to resist. Respect and reserve would have become
               their household deities; and where these alone reign, the hearth is but cold.</p><p>Rose Bradwardine is just the ideal of a girl—simple, affectionate, ready to please
               and to be pleased—likely to be formed by her associates, ill-fitted to be placed in
               difficult situations; but whose sweet and kindly nature is brought out by happiness
               and sunshine. She would be content to gaze on the plans her husband drew for
               "ornamental grottoes and temples,"<note>Not a direct quote, but a paraphrase of
                  Flora's rather dismissive description of Waverley's future domestic life. See

               talents did not need a more useful range and a higher purpose. Rose would have kept

               of retribution. I know nothing in the whole range of fiction—that fiction whose truth
               is life—so deeply affecting as "Flora in a large gloomy apartment, seated by a
               latticed window, sewing what seemed to be a garment of white flannel."<note>Slightly
                  altered from <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Waverley</title></hi>, Volume 3, Chapter 20.</note> It is the shroud of her brother—the last of
               his ancient line—the brave—the generous—the dearly-loved Fergus! How bitter is her
               anguish when she exclaims, "The strength of mind on which Flora prided herself has
               murdered her brother! Volatile and ardent, he would have divided his energies amid a
               thousand objects. It was I who taught him to concentrate them. Oh! that I could
               recollect that I had but once said to him 'He that striketh with the sword shall die
               by the sword!'"<note>From the same scene, with Flora quoting <title>Matthew</title>
                  26:52.</note></p><p><pb n="39"/>It is a fearful responsibility, the exercise of influence: let our own
               conduct bring its own consequences—we may well meet the worst; not so when we have
               led another to pursue any given line of action: if they suffer, how tenfold is that
               suffering visited on ourselves! For Flora life could offer nothing but the black veil
               of the Benedictine convent. There are no associations so precious as those of our
               earlier years. It is upon them that the heart turns back amid after-cares and
               sorrows:—the nursery, the old garden, the green field, remain the latest things that
               memory cherishes. They keep alive something of their own freshness and purity; and
               the affections belonging to those uncalculating hours have a faith and warmth unknown
               to after-life. To this ordinary but most sweet love Flora had added the ideal and the
               picturesque—and love, to reach its highest order, must be worked up by the
               imagination. She saw in her brother the chieftain of their line—the last descendant
               of Ivor. He was the support of the cause whose loyalty to its ill-fated adherents was
               as religion—their lofty enthusiasm was as much in common as their daily habits; they
               looked back and they looked forward together. When the last Vich Ian Vohr had
               perished on the scaffold, there remained for his lonely and devoted sister but the
               convent—a brief resting-place before the grave.</p><p rendition="#right"><ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">L. E. L.</ref></p></div></body></text></TEI>
