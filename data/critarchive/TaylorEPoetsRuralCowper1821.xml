            <p>T<hi rendition="#smcaps">here</hi> is scarcely a poet of any note in the annals of
               literature who has not expressed his enthusiastic admiration for the rural life. Yet
               a very small proportion of our bards have resided in the country, and, with few
               exceptions, we can scarcely name a set of men less apparently satisfied with
               seclusion, or whose practice has appeared more decidedly at variance with profession.
               We do not find fault with them for their conformity to their real notions of
               enjoyment; on the contrary, we think the world has gained much by it. But there is no
               occasion for any deception in the matter, and accordingly we find it is daily
               becoming a more simple and natural thing, if we may so speak, to be a poet. With all
               our admiration for departed genius, and, in individual instances, for its vast
               attainments, we cannot be insensible to this great charm of our modern poetry. We
               have done with poetical priestcraft. We see in our bards a race of men, not set
               apart, like Druids, for holy and solemn purposes, but mingling in our avocations,
               giving and collecting sweets from the social as well as from the solitary scene; men
               who feel keenly, and imagine promptly; men whom we are little inclined to take for
               our guides, "spiritual or temporal," but who nevertheless do sometimes quicken both
               body and soul: and while we think ourselves indebted to them for much that makes the
               rugged prospect of life look beautiful, we hold that the advantages of our communion
               are strictly mutual. Now and then a poetical Pope, or, if it pleases our readers
               better, a literary arch-druid, will start up, and plead for the almost-forgotten
               supremacy of the bard; but we, meanwhile, like not such extorted homage, and are
               better pleased with those wholesome, sweet, and life-cheering strains, which are
               evidently the product of minds kept in exercise by constant communion with their
               fellows, than with the lonely and mystical musings of the solitary dreamer. The
               retired poet is not, generally speaking, an agreeable character. We have no sympathy
               with a being who, while pretending to a more than ordinary relish for <hi
                  rendition="#italics">natural</hi>, seems to have little perception of <hi
                  rendition="#italics">social</hi>, beauty. Give us the bard who can bring to our
               fire-sides the light and warmth of his genius; who can place in new and beautiful
               colours the circumstances of our daily lives; whose heart seems to be touched with
               human kindness. With all <hi rendition="#italics">this</hi>, reason and experience
               tell us, may be joined a most exuberant imagination and a refined taste. Indeed, it
               is remarkable, that poetical genius has generally thriven much better in society than
               in solitude. Even our best descriptive poets have seldom been secluded men. Nothing,
               it will readily be acknowledged, can be more exquisite than some of <ref

               musing on the world of natural beauty. In accordance with this, we may observe that
               all his sweet and refreshing descriptions come in, in the way of digression: he
               pauses amid the hurry and business of action, to rest us with Lorenzo and Jessica in
               "the sweet moonlight;" and even while leading us along in the rapid career of
               ambition, he brings before our eyes, in lovely contrast, a view of the peaceful
               beauties of nature. None but a quick observer could have done this: but a habit of
               ready observation is chiefly to be acquired in active life; and hence it is, we
               think, that social habits are favourable to the improvement of the poetical
               character. It has been said, however, that retirement is desirable, not only or
               chiefly as it acquaints the poet with nature, but as it acquaints him with himself.
               This is very true; and we perfectly agree with <ref

            <p>However, the poet who trusts to meditation upon his own mind alone for improvement,
               will, we fear, find himself in the predicament of the religionist, who relies, for
               his spiritual progress, on solitariness and self-watching. Both disdain the aliment
               upon which mind and heart are fed, and both are in imminent danger of starvation.
               Both also are liable to fall into that great error, the darling child of solitude, an
               overweening sense of self-importance, and a contempt of their brethren of mankind. In
               the little poem from which we have above quoted, we find much to censure. The man who
               can thus deliberately set at nought the advantages of communion with his fellows, who
               can remark upon the scandalous, trifling, and unprofitable discourse of some, leaving

               tongues in every circle. We are apt to reckon the religious bigotry of <ref

               That bigotry, however, had in it nothing personal; and we can far better tolerate the

               liberty!</p>
            <p>We have thus prefaced the few remarks we intend to make upon the poems of <ref
                  target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>, in order to preclude the idea
               that our partialities are, <hi rendition="#italics">generally</hi>, in favour of
               retirement as the nurse of poetical talent,—an idea to which our fervent admiration
               for <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">the Bard of Weston</ref> might possibly
               lead. We think the case of <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>,
               however, a peculiar one. From the constitution of his mind it appears that his life
               must either have been <hi rendition="#italics">that</hi> which it really was, or <hi
                  rendition="#italics">a scene</hi> of excessive misery. All speculations,
               therefore, upon what he might have been under different circumstances, are cruelly
               misplaced. We regard him as one whose lot was cast for him without revoke; and we
               think of him as a poet who had nothing to do with systems, whose peculiarities were
               those of his own mind, and who wrote simply as he felt or imagined. Every one must
               allow that in spirit he was far from a dogmatist. His gentle and affectionate heart
               taught him the value of those social pleasures from which he felt himself for ever
               excluded:—hence there is not the smallest particle of the leaven of selfishness in
               his censures of the vices of society; not one word from whence we can reasonably
               infer that the poet was retaliating upon the world the wrongs which he had received.
               The character of Cowper's mind, though acute and penetrating, was not, doubtless,
               very enlarged. He was too timid a Christian to be a good metaphysician, and has
               written nothing which it requires any stretch of the faculties fully to comprehend.
               In this respect, indeed, he differs widely from <ref
                  target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Mr. Wordsworth</ref>, who, though often too
               mystical for the common run of poetical readers, is far better acquainted with the
               human mind. <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Mr. Wordsworth</ref>,
               however, when he stoops from his highest and most successful flights, is sure to
               affront common readers by being over trite and obvious. Not so <ref
                  target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>.<lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">m 2</hi></fw>
               <pb n="156"/> Natural and easy as he is, he is never babyish. The man, the scholar,
               and the poet, never are forgotten. We should be at a loss to point out any author
               throughout whose volumes we could discern the presence of such perfect and entire
               simplicity—yet only in one or two instances does it seem to have led him into details
               inconsistent with the dignity of poetry.</p>
            <p>A great deal has been said upon a question which we would fain avoid, if remarks upon
                  <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref> could be written without
               touching upon it. It has been thought improper to blend devotional addresses to the
               Supreme Being with appeals to the imagination; and poets who have done this are
               considered by many as having infringed on the province of fancy, and sinned against
               good taste. We perfectly agree with those who only mean to protest against our
               implicitly adopting the poet's creed; but, loving and respecting religion ourselves,
               we cannot see any thing objectionable in giving her cause all the advantage which
               good taste and good scholarship can bring to it. A great many people, doubtless, will
               admire such a poet as <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref> for his
               piety, who know little about poetry—but where is the harm of this? Such people, if
               they are not gifted by nature or education with an understanding capable of
               appreciating the highest kinds of poetical merit, are alive to the perception of
               beauty of some sort, and seeing religious and moral truths presented before them in
               an amiable and striking point of view, they catch a degree of refinement to which
               they would otherwise have been strangers. It is no slight merit to have raised and
               purified the devotional feelings of numbers, as Cowper has done.</p>
            <p>But the Poems of <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref> have often been
               accounted melancholy, and melancholy they are to us, who read them with the lively
               recollection of the poet's life before us. Yet it is not the fashion of our day to
               complain of our bards for indulging in depressing contemplations—many are allowed to
               mourn like <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>, who know but little
               of the hope that, in his darkest hours, kept its station near him, ready to comfort
               and cheer every moment which the black fiend of melancholy deigned to spare to her
               victim. It has cheered us, many a time, to think that over so dark a life such gleams
               of comfort came; that such awful visitations of evil should be interspersed with such
               exquisite perceptions of good; that the miseries of this life should be so often
               relieved by clear and decisive anticipations of that which is to come. Religion and
               nature are infinitely endeared to us while we observe their beneficial influence on
               the poet's mind.</p>
            <p>In conclusion—to wish <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref> other than
               he was, except with regard to his indescribable sufferings, is almost impossible. But
               we do not wish for other Cowpers. That depression which<pb n="157"/> unfitted him for
               the world, kept him from the desire of literary dictation. He stood alone — but his
               loneliness was not the effect of pride. For most poets a very different lot is
                  desirable.</p>
