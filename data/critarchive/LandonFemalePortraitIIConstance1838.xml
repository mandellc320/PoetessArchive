               back upon the pages of a favourite author. Nothing shows us more forcibly the change
               that has taken place in ourselves. The book is a mental mirror—the mind starts from
               its own face, so much freshness, and so much fire has passed away. The colours and
               the light of youth have gone together. The judgment of the man rarely confirms that
               of the boy. What was once sweet has become mawkish, and the once exquisite simile
               appears little more than an ingenious conceit. The sentiment which the heart once
               beat to applaud has now no answering key-note within, and the real is perpetually
               militating against the imagined. It is a great triumph to the poet when we return to
               the volume, and find that our early creed was, after all, the true religion. Few
               writers stand this test so well as <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter
                  Scott</ref>. We read him at first with an eagerness impetuous as his own verse:
               years elapse, we again take up those living pages, and we find ourselves carried away
               as before. Our choice has changed, perhaps, as to favourites passages, but we still
               find favourites. Scott is the epic poet of England; he does for chivalry what <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref> did for the heroic age. He caught it just
               fading into dim oblivion, living by tradition, veiled by superstition, uncertain and
               exaggerated; yet not less the chaos from whence sprang the present, which must trace
               to that morning checquered darkness, the acquisitions and the characteristics of
               to-day. What constitutes the great epic poet? his power of revivifying the past. It
               is not till a nation has gained a certain point in civilization that it desires to
               look back; but when action allows a breathing time for thought, and the mechanical
               and customary has succeeded to the adventurous and unexpected, then we desire to
               trace the Nile of our moral progress to its far and hidden fountains. It is this
               desire which is the inspiration of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter
                  Scott</ref>. From the dim waters he evokes the shining spirit, and from scattered
               fragments constructs the glorious whole. We cannot sympathize with the regret that he
               expresses in one of the exquisite introductions to <title>"Marmion,"</title> when but
               for want of kingly countenance— <quote><lg type="stanza"><l>Dryden, in immortal strain,</l><l>Had raised the Table Round again.<note>From <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</ref>'s <title><hi rendition="#italics"> Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field</hi></title>, Introduction to Canto First, lines 275-6.</note></l></lg></quote><ref target="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</ref> lived in an age when the political
               and moral standards were set at too low a water-mark for the high tides of poetry.
               With the most splendid and vigorous versification, with an energy of satire and wit
               that had the point of the dagger and the weight of the axe, <ref target="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</ref> was deficient in what <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> possessed. He would have lacked the
               picturesque which calls up yesterday, and the sentiment which links it with to-day.
               The machinery of guardian angels which he proposed is enough to show that the first
               design was a failure. It is a great poetical mis- <pb n="184"/> take to revive
               exploded superstition. The gods are effective in <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref>, because both the age of which he wrote and that in which he wrote
               believed devoutly in the terrors of their thunder. But the guardian angels of
               England, Ireland, and Scotland—<ref target="people.html#GeorgeSaint">St.
               George</ref>, <ref target="people.html#PatrickSaint">St. Patrick</ref>, and <ref target="people.html#AndrewApostleSaint">St. Andrew</ref>—could never have been
               more than ingenious human inventions. Scott did as much with superstition as any
               modern writer could venture. He gave the omen, the prophecy, and the
                  gramarye,<note>Magic or sorcery.</note> without which the picture he drew would
               have been incomplete. And what a picture he has drawn! how true, how breathing! It is
               England exactly as England was—full of tumult and of adventure, but with a rude sense
               of justice and a dawn of information destined to produce such vast after-growth of
               knowledge and prosperity. No writer has the art of conveying so much by a slight
               intimation. Sir Hugh the Heron Bold<note>A character from <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Marmion</title></hi> who receives Marmion at Norham Castle in the first Canto.</note> urges his

               piece of domestic quiet. The metre, too, of these noble poems was admirably chosen.
               It is entirely English—it belongs to the period it illustrates—and the battle alone
               in <title>"Marmion"</title> may show what was its spirit and strength. It must,
               indeed, have rung like a silver trumpet amid the silken inanities of the Hayley and
               Seward school. It is quite odd now to read the sort of deprecating praise with which
               these poems were received by the established critical authorities. The expression of
               popular applause is too strong to be resisted, but while <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Mr. Scott's</ref> talents are universally
               admitted, he is constantly admonished to choose some loftier theme, as if any theme
               could have been better suited to a great national poet than one belonging to the
               history of that country whose youth is renewed in his stirring lines.</p><p> Never did any one age produce two minds so essentially opposed as those of <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref> and <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>. <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref> idealised and expressed that bitter
               spirit of discontent which has at the present moment taken a more material and
               tangible form. He is the incarnation of November. From time immemorial it has been an
               Englishman's privilege to grumble, and <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref> gave picturesque language to the universal feeling. He embodied in
               his heroes what is peculiarly our insular character—its shyness, its sensitiveness,
               and its tendency to morbid despondency. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, on the contrary, took the more commercial and fighting side of the
               character; he embodied its enterprise and resistance. The difference is strongly
               shown in the delineation of their two most marked heroes—<title>"Lara"</title><note>From <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>'s <title><hi rendition="#italics">Lara, A Tale</hi></title>, a tragic narrative poem first published in 1814.</note> and
                  <title>"Marmion."</title> Both are men brave, unscrupulous, and accustomed <pb n="185"/> to action; but Lara turns disgusted from a world which to him has
               neither an illusion nor a pleasure. Marmion, on the contrary, desires to pursue his
               career of worldly advancement: he looks forward to increased riches and power, and
               indulges in no misanthropic misgivings as to the worth of the acquisition when once
               gained. Both are attended by a Page—that favourite creation of the olden dramatists;
                  <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron's</ref> is little more than the
               shadowy but graceful outline: <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> has
               worked out his creation truly and severely. The Pages in the old drama are entirely
               poetical creations; they occupy the debatable ground between the fanciful and the
               existing; they belong exclusively to the romantic in literature. They could only have
               been fancied when poetry delighted to hold love a creed as well as a passion. The
               heart called up the ideal to redeem the real, and an attachment was elevated by
               disinterestedness and moral beauty. There is none of this high-toned imagination in
               the classic fictions. Women were then considered as articles of property.

               loss of the first; still it says little for the delicacy or the constancy of the lady

               every passion was refined, and every affection exalted. Only under the purifying
               influence of that inward world to which it gave light, could sentiment have had its
               birth—and sentiment is the tenth Muse and the fourth Grace of modern poetry.</p><p> But in the description of Constance<note>In <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s <title><hi rendition="#italics"> Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field</hi></title>, Constance is a dishonest nun and rejected mistress to Marmion. In hopes
                  of winning him back, she aids him in forging a letter to implicate in treason the
                  fiance of Clara de Clare, Marmion's current love interest. Constance ends up
                  immured in a convent for having broken her holy vows.</note> there also is that

               degradation.

               can never quite account—to trace the progress by which innocence becomes guilt, and
               how those who formerly trembled to think of crime, are led on to commit that at which
               they once shuddered. The man the most steeped in wickedness, must have had his
               innocent and his happy moments—a child, he must have played in the sunshine with
               spirits as light as the golden curls that toss on the wind. His little hands must
               have been clasped in prayer at his mother's knee; he must, during some moment of
               youth's generous warmth, have pitied human suffering, and wondered how man's blood
               could ever be shed by man: and if this holds good of man—how much more so of woman!
               But that it is one of those stern truths which experience forces us to know—we never
               could believe in murder as a feminine crime; yet, from the days of <ref target="people.html#Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</ref>, down to those of Mrs.
               Johnson, who took her trial for murder, "looking very respectable in a black silk
               cloak and straw bonnet," woman has been urged on to that last and most desperate
               wickedness. But the causes of masculine sin are more various than those which act
               upon the gentler sex. A woman's crime has almost always its origin in that which was
               given to be the sweetest and best part of her nature—her affections: a man's
               influence is much greater over a woman than hers over him—almost unconsciously she
               models her sentiments upon his—she adopts his opinions, she acquires the greater
               portion of her information through his means. As to her character—by character, I
               would wish to express that mental bent, which, once taken, always influences, more or
               less, that character—"Love gave it energy, as love gave it birth."<note>"The Ettrick
                  Shepherd" [<ref target="people.html#HoggJames">James Hogg</ref>], "<title>The

               step in life; for the first time she is called up to decide; and on that decision how
               much of the future will rest! There are, of course, many exceptions to this
               rule—there are instances in which the wife has been the redeeming angel—but, in nine
               cases out of ten, the man raises or depresses his companion to his own moral level. I
               remember once staying with a lady who was robbed of a valuable gold chain. The
               policeman was sent for, and his first inquiry was, as to who "the maid kept company
               with? for the London thieves have a regular set of lovers—and that is how half the
               robberies are committed." Constance is worked out in darker colours than <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> often uses for his feminine
               portraits. Our sex, at least, ought to be grateful to him, for how divine is the
               faith he holds in all that is good in us! Even with <pb n="187"/> Constance, how much
               the soul is "subdued by pity!"—how is the horror relieved by beauty! I know no
               description conveying such an idea of exquisite loveliness, as that of Constance
               before her judges:— <quote><lg type="stanza"><l>Her sex a page's dress belied,</l><l>Obscured her charms, but could not hide.</l><l>A monk undid the silken band,</l><l rendition="#indent1">That tied her tresses fair;</l><l>And down her slender form they spread,</l><l rendition="#indent1">In ringlets rich and rare.</l><l>When thus her face was given to view,</l><l>Although so pallid was her hue,</l><l>It did a ghastly contrast bear</l><l>To those bright ringlets glistering fair:</l><l>Her look composed, and steady eye,</l><l>Bespoke a matchless constancy;</l><l>And there she stood, so calm and pale,</l><l>That, but her breathing did not fail,</l><l>And motion slight of eye and head,</l><l>And of her bosom, warranted</l><l>That neither sense nor pulse she lacks,</l><l>You might have thought a form of wax,</l><l>Wrought to the very life, was there,</l><l>So still she was, so pale, so fair.<note><ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Marmion</title></hi>, Canto Second, "The Convent," stanza XX and XXI, lines 384-414,

               to suggest to the imagination. The above picture brings Constance's previous
               existence so vividly to mind! The fugitive nun is again beneath the sway from whence
               she once fled:—she fled, timid, trusting, and hopeful; the beating heart, impatient
               of restraint, and confident of happiness—the lurking daring shown in the very escape;
               and the native courage in the resolve that could brave all the terrors of

               affection too utterly self-sacrificing always meets with an evil return. The

               punishments that guilt can know. Our youth is gone from us with all its kindlinesses,

               bitterness and anger to error.</p><p> Such are the dark materials<note>An allusion to <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Paradise Lost</title></hi>, Book 2, line 916.</note> out of which the character of Constance is formed;
               we can trace its degradation step by step—we see how the timid has grown hardened—the
               resolute reckless—and the affectionate only passionate. Constant contact with coarser
               natures has seared the finer perceptions, and the sense of right and wrong is
               deadened by hardship, suffering, and evil communion. The character so formed has now
               to be worked upon by the most fearful passion which can agitate the human heart—that
               which is strong as death and cruel as the grave—the passion of jealousy. The name of
               jealousy is often taken in vain—<ref target="people.html#HenryVIIIKingofEngland">Henry VIII</ref>. is called jealous when he was only tyrannical;—the mere desire
               of influence, envy, and irritability of temper, are often veiled under the name of
               jealousy; and many a husband and wife talk of "being jealous," while in reality
               profoundly indifferent to each other, and only desiring a decent excuse for anger: it
               is oftener envy than any other feeling. But the passion of jealousy cannot exist
               without the passion of love, and is like its parent, creative, impetuous, and
               credulous. Earth holds no misery so great as that of doubting the affection, which is
               dearer than life itself—and perhaps it takes its worst shape to a woman. Her
               attachment is to her more than it ever can be to a man. It enters into her ordinary
               course of existence—it belongs to the small sweet cares of every day—while it is not
               less the great aim and end of her being. With her, but "once to doubt" is not "once
               to be resolved,"<note>Loosely quoting <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespeare</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Othello</title></hi>, Act III, scene iii, lines 179-80.</note> but to plunge into a chaos of
               small distracting fears. How much more must this be the case when the affection has
               been one of sacrifice and of dishonour! Constance must have watched for weary hours
               the slightest sign of change—she must have feared before she felt—expected long
               before it came—yet scarce believed when it did come. At length the fatal hour
               arrives; she knows that she is "betrayed and scorned."<note><ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Marmion</title></hi>, Canto Third, "The Hostel, or Inn," stanza XVI, line 268.</note> In the
