               before us, there are none in which <hi rendition="#italics">our</hi> writers of the
               male sex have less excelled, since the days of Richardson and Fielding, than in the
               arrangement of a novel. Ladies seem to appropriate to themselves an exclusive
               privilege in this kind of writing; witness the numerous productions of romantic tales
               to which female authors have given birth. The portraiture of the tender passions, the
               delicacy of sentiment, and the easy flow of style, may, perhaps, be most adapted to
               the genius of the softer sex: but however that may be, politeness, certainly, will
               not suffer us to dispute this palm with our fair competitors. We, though of the
               harder sex, as men, and of a still harder <hi rendition="#italics">race as
                  critics</hi>, are no enemies to an affecting well-told story: but as we are <hi rendition="#italics">known</hi> not to be very <hi rendition="#italics">easily
                  pleased</hi>, it may be imagined that those performances only will obtain the
               sanction of our applause, which can stand the test of certain criteria of
               excellence.</p><p> The story of a novel should be formed of a variety of interesting incidents; a
               knowlege of the world, and of mankind, are essential requisites in the writer; the
               characters should be always natural; the personages should talk, think, and act, as
               becomes their respective ages, situations, and characters; the sentiments should be
               moral, chaste, and delicate; the language should be easy, correct, and elegant, free
               from affectation, and unobscured by pedantry; and the narrative should be as little
               interrupted as possible by digressions and episodes of every kind: yet if an author
               chuses to indulge, occasionally, in moral reflections, in the view of blending
               instruction with amusement, we would not wish, altogether, to frustrate so good a
               design:—but, that his precepts may obtain the utmost efficacy, <pb n="401"/>we would
               recommend them to be inserted in those periods of the history, where the reader's
               curiosity can most patiently submit to suspense. </p><p> Having thus given a sketch of what a novel should be to <hi rendition="#italics">please us</hi>, we proceed to the work which has given occasion to these
               remarks.</p><p> This novel, then, consists of a series of letters between the Hon. Mr. Wilton and
               his friend Mr. Benfield. Mr. Wilton is the son of Lord Wilton, a cruel, avaritious,
               despotic parent, who wishes to force his son into a marriage, (extremely against his
               inclinations,) with Miss Silvertop, a young lady of large fortune: the parties are
               introduced to each other, and are left alone for the purpose of <hi rendition="#italics">making love</hi>; when, unluckily, the gentleman begins by
               asking the young lady, <hi rendition="#italics">which are her favourites among the
                  dramatic authors</hi>. Miss Silvertop, not having been instructed in her literary
               catechism, stares, and seems not to comprehend him. He is not, however, discouraged:
               but pursues his <hi rendition="#italics">learned inquiries</hi>, till at last the
               young lady betrays such a total <hi rendition="#italics">want of erudition</hi>, that
               Mr. Wilton, completely disgusted, resolves, in defiance of all paternal injunctions,
               to decline the marriage. Lord Wilton is in great wrath, utters dreadful imprecations,
               and even curses his son, who runs out of the house, gets into a stage coach, and
               arrives at Morpeth in Northumberland; where he becomes enamoured of a beautiful young
               lady, named Olivia. Mr. Fennel, one of Olivia's lovers, is jealous of Mr. Wilton, and
               sends him a challenge; a duel ensues—Mr. W. disarms and wounds his antagonist; who is
               so enraged, that he <hi rendition="#italics">insists on being dead</hi>, that Mr. W.
               may be <hi rendition="#italics">hanged:</hi>—the latter is therefore, with all due
               formality, ushered into a prison: but Mr. Fennel, having reported <hi rendition="#italics">falsely of himself that he was </hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">dead</hi>, and being <hi rendition="#italics">taken
                  alive</hi>, Mr. Wilton is released from his confinement, and marries Olivia; who
               proves to be another Miss Silvertop. The old Lord, who had determined an alliance
               with the family of the Silvertops, recalls his curses, and changes them into
               blessings; and a happy union likewise takes place, with regard to an episodical pair,
               whose adventures serve to diversify the work:—which here naturally concludes.</p><p> In regard to the general character of Mr. Thomson's performance, it certainly is not
               void of merit. The volumes abound with pious and moral reflections, not unworthy the
               pen of a clergyman: but we should have admired this piety and this morality still
               more, had the language (especially of the earlier letters,) been less verbose, and
               the style less stiffened with hard words. Terms of the same signification are
               frequently <pb n="402"/>coupled together<note>For instance, 'black criminality,'
                  pref. p. 7.; 'Wanton lasciviousness,' ib. p.9.; 'mutual reciprocation,' ib. p.16.;
                  'cautious timidity;' p. 32.—Other expressions, which we have remarked, seem much
                  too stiff and pedantic for the characters that use them,—as, 'Pray, Madam,'
                  answers Mr. Wilton to a question from his lady mother, ' what prompts the
                  interrogation ?'—' My dear Henry,' says the countess, 'I am afraid the air of your
                  native country, after so long an absence in the warmer climates of France and
                  Italy, is not <hi rendition="#italics">congenial</hi> to your health, as you seem
                  to have <hi rendition="#italics">acquired</hi> a slight indisposition this
                  morning,' p. 33.; and the Hon. Mr. W. is, in like manner, accosted by his
                  honourable sister, with 'Pray, Henry, if our native air be more <hi rendition="#italics">salubrious</hi> than that of the continent'—p. 36. With
                  equal solemnity does the young nobleman answer his Right Hon. father's haughty
                  commands to marry the lady <hi rendition="#italics">not</hi> of his choice: 'The
                  will hath a certain prerogative, in the exercise of which it admits of no
                  compulsory methods to corrode its happiness. It thinks, it acts with <hi rendition="#italics"> spontaneity</hi>; and when opposed, suffers a diminution
                  of its pleasure.' p. 37 &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/> We would just observe, also, that the
                  hero of this piece is said to be the only son of the <hi rendition="#italics">Earl</hi> Wilton, and yet he is merely styled the <hi rendition="#italics">Hon. Mr.</hi> Wilton. Every Earl has a secondary title, which, by courtesy, is
                  borne by his eldest son; and his daughters are addressed as <hi rendition="#italics">Lady Ann, Lady Mary,</hi> &amp;c. [<ref target="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Moody</ref>'s note]. </note>: a mode of
               writing rather suitable to an indenture than a book of entertainment; and peculiarly
               inconsistent with the natural case and freedom of the epistolary style.</p><p> Notwithstanding the impropriety of the language of some parts of this work, for it
               is not uniformly thus censurable, the story has not failed to interest us in the
               perusal; and it would be great injustice to the sensible writer, if we did not speak
               of his performance as entitled to a considerable degree of distinction above the
               common crowed—the <hi rendition="#italics">canaille</hi> of modern romances and
               novels.</p><p> The leading moral purpose of this work, is to expose the unreasonableness,
               absurdity, and tyranny, of parents who usurp an absolute authority over their
               children, in respect of their matrimonial engagements; forcing all natural affection,
               and every prospect of happiness from that source, to give way to the calls of avarice
               or ambition.—This is a beaten path, which has been trodden by almost every novellist
               and dramatic writier;—who, we are happy to think, have successively encountered a
               monster which is now seldom seen but in their performances.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
