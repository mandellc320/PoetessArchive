               circumstances, and yet there is one which may be applied on all occasions—"Judge not"
               is the general motto. Take the actions of our nearest friends, and how little do we
               know of the hopes that instigated, or of the fears that prevailed! We sometimes
               cannot avoid owning that we ourselves have committed a fault, but how we gloss it
               over—how we take temperament and temptation into account, till at length it appears
               to be a thing inevitable—redeemed by the regret it has occasioned, and the lesson it
               has given. Not so do we reason for others—then we look to the isolated fact, not to
               the causes: the error shuts out the excuse. The truth is, we know nothing of each
               other excepting by the aid of philosophy and of poetry; philosophy, that analyzes our
               thoughts, and poetry that expresses our feelings. Little of the examination of the
               one, or of the tenderness of the other, enters into our daily opinions, and yet by
               them we alone know the hidden heart within. "Judge not" is the first great rule of
               the moral world; it is equally applicable to the literary one. Yesterday is
               constantly reversing the decree of to-day; our notion of our contemporaries is
               biassed in many ways—vanities, envyings, and prejudices are things <quote><lg type="stanza"><l>All taking many shapes, and bearing many names;<note><ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Manfred</title></hi>, Act III, scene i, line 148.</note></l></lg></quote> but all alike shutting out the light. Time is the great leveller, but he is
               also the sanctifier and the beautifier. If our judgement, then, of our own literature
               be liable to so many objections, what must it be when we attempt to decide on that of
               a foreign nation; the maxim, "Judge not," must indeed be the first principle laid
               down. No stranger can enter into one great charm thrown around the poetry of every
               country—namely, that of association. Unconsciously to ourselves, we connect with our
               favourite writers the emotions which first made us seek in them for expression, and
               with the scenes amid which we turned their pages. Did we read them in summer, under
               the silver shiver of the aspen?—they have gathered to themselves the sunshine raining
               through the leaves, and the freshness on the open air. Were they our companions by
               the hearth-side on a long winter evening?—they are linked with pleasant memories of
               comfort and of home. It is impossible for a stranger to share these subtle
               sympathies, and yet their atmosphere is around the literature of every nation. But
               literary, like all other commerce, has its incalculable advantages: the merchant
               brings with him not only wealth, but knowledge. Communication is in itself
               civilization; we wear away our own prejudices only by contact with those of others.
               We are forced into making allowances, by seeing how much we need that they should be
               made for ourselves. </p><p><ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> says, in an admirable
               spirit of candour, "In living literature no person is a competent judge but of works
               written in his own language. I have expressed my opinion concerning a number of
               English writers; it is very possible that I may be mistaken, that my admiration and
               my censure may be equally misplaced, and that my conclusions may appear impertinent
               and ridiculous on the other side of the Channel."<note>This and Landon's other
                  quotations from <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> can be
                  found in his <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Sketches of English Literature; with Considerations on the Spirit of the
                        Times, Men, and Revolutions</title></hi> (London: <ref target="people.html#ColburnHenry">Henry Colburn</ref>, 1836).
                  In many cases, quotation is loose. In this instance, for example, several
                  sentences are silently omitted (see 2nd ed. vol. II, p. 232).</note> They can
               appear neither ridiculous nor impertinent; we<pb n="63"/> may, and we do differ from
               many of these conclusions, but we feel that they have been drawn by a clever man, and
               drawn, too, in a spirit of candour. If any man be entitled to form a judgment, that
               man is <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>. A poet himself,
               his whole life has been a poet's education, and he has studied our literature next to
               his own. But there is something in the French and the English character so
               essentially opposed, that it is impossible for them to understand each other. Now a
               nation's character is in its literature. Some writer says, "The great difference of
               the two nations is, that the one lives out of doors and the other in; the one thinks
               of the people that are looking at him, and the other thinks of himself."<note>Not yet
                  identified.</note> This principle will account for the frequent self-reference in
               these pages, which, however, has more the appearance than the reality of vanity. An
               Englishman is timid of drawing attention to himself—he is afraid of being laughed at;
               a Frenchman, on the contrary, relies on your indulgence. <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> believes that genius is a
               moral problem, which it is matter of general attraction to solve; and he submits
               rather than advances his pretensions to the public, with a quiet conviction of their
               interest, which an English writer, however successful, would be too well aware of his
               and our national characteristics, to adventure. The style of the author of
                  "<title>Atala</title>"<note><ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>'s 1801 novel of
                  ill-fated love between two American Indians of opposing tribes.</note> has no
               parallel in our literature—it is what supplies in France the place of blank verse; it
               is redundant in epithet and simile, many of which appear to us grandiloquent: for
               example, <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> is called "the
               young butcher of Strafford."<note><ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>, "Contemporaries of

                     Colburn</ref>, 1837, vol. I, p. 303.</note> Again, speaking of our writers
               among the lower classes, he says, "At the present day it is a blacksmith that
               shines—Vulcan was the son of Jupiter:"<note><ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>, "The Lake

               magnificent. By-the-by, to what blacksmith does he allude?—we must confess our
               ignorance. There is a curious little instance of the mistakes inevitable to foreign
               critics: <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> quotes, as a
               charming specimen of our simple ballad poetry, a stanza of a song:—<quote><lg type="stanza"><l rendition="#indent4">Where tarries my love,</l><l rendition="#indent4">Where tarries my love,</l><l>Where tarries my true love from me?</l><l rendition="#indent4">Come hither my dove,</l><l rendition="#indent4">I will write to my love,</l><l>And send him a letter by thee.<note>The first stanza is part of a
                           traditional Scottish ballad, "Why Tarries My Love?" It's tone is
                           sentimental, with the dove that carries the message dying from exhaustion
                           as it reaches its destination. The parodic reworking that features the
                           quoted resolution has not been located.</note></l></lg></quote> He appears perfectly ignorant that the song is a burlesque. The lover
               receives the letter, but <quote><lg type="stanza"><l rendition="#indent4">The generous youth,</l><l rendition="#indent4">Full of valour and truth,</l><l>Had not eated a morsel that day; </l><l rendition="#indent4">So the pigeon he roasted,</l><l rendition="#indent4">His true love he toasted, </l><l>And mounted and gallop'd away.</l></lg></quote> A singular sample of the tender melancholy which marks our lyrics!</p><p><ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref>'s life has been that of a
               poet; a life, however, an exception to the general rule. He has known his share of
               toil and of trouble—he has been poor, proscribed, and imprisoned; still he is among

                  <pb n="64"/>under the shadow of their own laurels; yet what strange contrasts will
               his memoirs present! Now a wanderer in the deserts of the East—then comparing the

               many channels of inquiry thrown open by the Reformation be considered other than as
               conduits to truth? We are quite prepared to admit that we do not do justice to the
               beneficial influence exercised by the Catholic church on the darker ages. It was the
               republic of the time, supported by democratic talent. The man of ability found in the
               church his theatre of action; all other avenues to power or to distinction were
               barred by the sword, which was given as a birthright to the noble. But in the ranks
               of the Catholic faith the equality, or rather the superiority of intellect was
               asserted; and when king and chief knelt at the chair of St. Peter, it was the triumph
               of thought over strength—it was the weak mind subjugated by the strong. But, as
               usual, the authority outlived its necessity—other influences began their activity;
               and again, as usual, one of those men arose who embody their epoch, and carry its
               spirit into action. That man was <ref target="people.html#LutherMartin">Luther</ref>.
               He was an enthusiast—enthusiasm is needed for action; calculation never acts—it is a
               passive principle. He was fierce, angry, and governed by impulse; but we must
               remember the old Greek proverb, "Motives are from man, but impulse is from Heaven."
               These qualities only the better fitted the instrument to its purpose. It is touching
                  <pb n="65"/>to note the tender feelings of the man running in a soft under-current
               beneath the violence of the fanatic preacher: speaking of his children he says, "What

               again entrusted to one hand. He was the last feudal king—and was the type of a system
               that expired with himself. Brave, magnificent, and courteous, he was cruel, profuse,
               and uncertain. In the meantime England was in a state of progression; then were first

               arises from having no standard of comparison by which to try the merits of "Paradise
               Lost." There is nothing like it in French literature, and the critic has no
               preconceived notions to whose test the foreign work must submit. In speaking of the
               drama, he is fettered by early associations of admiration, links as slight as those

               apart world of imagination, solemn, and stately, which is to be entered by the ideal

               who does not bitterly regret the hour he took pen in hand. The fame is far off, and
               like sunshine seen in the distance, while only the cold wind is felt on the actual
               path. The wider circle think but little of all you have done for their gratification,
               until it is too late to think at all. The nearer circle of intimates and
               acquaintances never forgive the distinction which separates you from themselves. But
               genius will at last learn the bitter lesson of all experience: like everything else
               in the present day, it will be taught to calculate.

The inspiration of the poet is like the
               inspiration of the Delphic oracles: what was once held divine is now confessed the
               promptings of an evil spirit mocking the votaries of whom it made victims. We firmly
               believe that the time is fast approaching when no more books will be written. The
               once writers will say—"Why should we sacrifice our whole existence to obtain a vain
               praise, which, after all, never comes sufficiently home to us to be enjoyed? Why
               should we devote, to this most barren pursuit, industry<lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">f 2</hi></fw><pb n="68"/> and talent, which in any other line, would be certain of that worldly
               success, which, as we live in the world, is the only success to be desired?" Even
               poets must at last learn wisdom. The bitterness and hollowness of praise will be
               perceived; and then who will be at the trouble of writing a book? Again we repeat,
               the time is fast approaching when no more books will be written. </p><p><hi rendition="#smcaps">Note.</hi>—The list of "literary calamities" is far from
