            <p rendition="#pnoindent">A <hi rendition="#smcaps">Collection</hi> of Novels has a
					better chance of giving pleasure than of commanding respect. Books of this
					description are condemned by the grave, and despised by the fastidious; but
					their leaves are seldom found unopened, and they occupy the parlour and the
					dressing-room while productions of higher name are often gathering dust upon the
					shelf. It might not perhaps be difficult to show that this species of
					composition is entitled to a higher rank than has been generally assigned it.
					Fictitious adventures, in one form or other, have made a part of the polite
					literature of every age and nation. These have been grafted upon the actions of
					their heroes; they have been interwoven with their mythology; they have been
					moulded upon <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left">

               <pb n="2"/> the manners of the age,—and, in return, have influenced the
					manners of the succeeding generation by the sentiments they have infused and the
					sensibilities they have excited. </p>
            <p>Adorned with the embellishments of Poetry, they produce the epic; more
					concentrated in the story, and exchanging narrative for action, they become
					dramatic. When allied with some great moral end, as in the <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Telemaque</title>
               </hi> of <ref target="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</ref>, and <ref target="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Belisaire</title>
               </hi>, they may be termed
					didactic. They are often made the vehicles of satire, as in <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Gulliver's Travels</title>
               </hi>, and the
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Candide</title>
               </hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Babouc</title>
               </hi> of <ref target="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</ref>. They take a tincture from the
					learning and politics of the times, and are made use of successfully to attack
					or recommend the prevailing systems of the day. When the range of this kind of
					writing is so extensive, and its effect so great, it seems evident that it ought
					to hold a respectable place among the productions of genius; nor is it easy to
					say, why the poet, who deals in one kind of fiction, should have so high a place
					allotted him in the temple of fame; and the romance-writer so low a one as in
					the general estimation he is confined to. To measure the dignity of a writer by
					the pleasure he affords his readers is not perhaps using an accurate criterion;
					but the invention of a story, the choice of proper incidents, <pb n="3"/> the
					ordonnance of the plan, occasional beauties of description, and above all, the
					power exercised over the reader's heart by filling it with the successive
					emotions of love, pity, joy, anguish, transport, or indignation, together with
					the grave, impressive moral resulting from the whole, imply talents of the
					highest order, and ought to be appretiated accordingly. A good novel is an epic
					in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of
					the supernatural machinery.<hi rendition="#sup">

            <p>If we look for the origin of fictitious tales and adventures, we shall be obliged
					to go to the earliest accounts of the literature of every age and country. The
					Eastern nations have always been fond of this species of mental gratification.
					The East is emphatically the country of invention. The Persians, Arabians, and
					other nations in that vicinity have been, and still are, in the habit of
					employing people whose business it is to compose and to relate entertaining
					stories; and it is surprising how many stories (as <ref target="people.html#ParnellThomas">Parnell</ref>'s
						<title>Hermit</title> for instance) which have passed current in verse and
					prose through a variety of forms, may be traced up to this source. From Persia

            <p>In the time of the Greek emperors these compositions were numerous, and had

                  <title>Theagenes and
						Chariclea</title>
               </hi>, a romance or novel, written by <ref target="people.html#Heliodorus">Heliodorus</ref> bishop of Tricca in
					Thessaly, who flourished under <ref target="people.html#Arcadius">Arcadius</ref>
					and <ref target="people.html#Honorius">Honorius</ref>. Though his production was
					perfectly chaste and virtuous, he was called to account for it by a provincial
					synod, and ordered to burn his book or resign his bishopric; upon which, with
					the heroism of an author, he chose the <pb n="5"/> latter. Of this work a new
					translation was given in 1789; and had this Selection admitted translations, it
					would have found a place here. It is not so much read as it ought to be; and it
					may not be amiss to inform the customers to circulating libraries, that they may
					have the pleasure of reading a genuine novel, and at the same time enjoy the
					satisfaction of knowing how people wrote in Greek about love, above a thousand
					years ago. The scene of this work is chiefly laid in Egypt. It opens in a
					striking and picturesque manner. A band of pirates, from a hill that overlooks
					the Heracleotic mouth of the Nile, see a ship lying at anchor, deserted by its
					crew; a feast spread on the shore; a number of dead bodies scattered round,
					indicating a recent skirmish or quarrel at an entertainment: the only living
					creatures, a most beautiful virgin seated on a rock, weeping over and supporting
					a young man of an equally distinguished figure, who is wounded and apparently
					lifeless. These are the hero and the heroine of the piece, and being thus let
					into the middle of the story, the preceding events are given in narration. The
					description of the manner of life of the pirates at the mouth of the Nile is
					curious, and no doubt historical. It shows that, as well then as in <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref>'s time, piracy was looked upon
					as a <milestone n="b 3" unit="signature"/>
               <pb n="6"/> mode of honourable war,
					and that a captain who treated the women with respect, and took a regular ransom
					for his captives, and behaved well to his men, did not scruple to rank himself
					with other military heroes. Indeed it might be difficult to say why he should
					not. It is a circumstance worth observing, that <ref target="people.html#TassoTorquato">Tasso</ref> has in all probability
					borrowed a striking circumstance from the Greek romance. <hi rendition="#italics">Chariclea</hi> is the daughter of a queen of
					Æthiopia, exposed by her mother to save her reputation, as, in consequence
					of the queen, while pregnant, having gazed at a picture of <ref target="people.html#Perseus">Perseus</ref> and <ref target="people.html#Andromeda">Andromeda</ref>, her infant was born with a
					fair complexion. This is the counterpart of the story of Clorinda, in the
						<title>Gierusalemme Liberata</title>, whose mother is surprised with the
					same phænomenon, occasioned by having had in her chamber a picture of St.
					George. The discovery is kept back to the end of the piece, and is managed in a
					striking manner. There is much beautiful description, of which the pomp of
					heathen sacrifices and processions makes a great part; and the love is at once
					passionate and chaste. </p>
            <p>The pastoral romance of <ref target="people.html#Longus">Longus</ref> is also
					extant in the Greek language. It is esteemed elegant, but it would be impossible
					to chastise it into decency. The Latins, who had less <pb n="7"/> invention, had
					no writings of this kind, except the <hi rendition="#italics">

							Ass</title>
               </hi> of <ref target="people.html#Apuleius">Apuleius</ref>
					may be reckoned such. In it is found the beautiful episode of Cupid and Psyche,

               </hi> But romance writing was destined to revive with
					greater splendour under the Gothic powers, and it sprung out of the histories of
					the times, enlarged and exaggerated into fable. Indeed all fictions have
					probably grown out of real adventures. The actions of heroes would be the most
					natural subject for recital in a warlike age; a little flattery and a little
					love of the marvellous would overstep the modesty of truth in the narration. A
					champion of extraordinary size would be easily magnified into a giant. Tales of
					magic and enchantment probably took their rise from the awe and wonder with
					which the vulgar looked upon any instance of superior skill in mechanics or
					medicine, or acquaintance with any of the hidden properties of nature. The
					Arabian Tales, so well known and so delightful, bear testimony to this. At a
					fair in Tartary a <hi rendition="#italics">magician</hi> appears, who brings
					various curiosities, the idea of which was probably suggested by inventions they
					had heard of, which to people totally ignorant of the mechanical powers would
					appear the effect of enchantment. <pb n="8"/> How easily might the exhibition at
						<ref target="people.html#MerlinJohnJoseph">Merlin</ref>'s, or the
					tricks of <ref target="people.html#JonasPhilip">Jonas</ref>, be made to pass for
					magic in New Holland or Otaheite! Letters and figures were easily turned into
					talismans by illiterate men, who saw that a great deal was effected by them, and
					intelligence conveyed from place to place in a manner they could not account
					for. Medicine has always, in rude ages and countries, been accompanied with
					charms and superstitious practices, and the charming of serpents in the East is
					still performed in a way which the Europeans cannot discover. The total
					separation of scholastic characters from men of the world favoured the belief of
					magic; and when to these causes are added the religious superstitions of the
					times, we shall be able to account for much of the marvellous in the first
					instance. These stories, as well as the historical ones, would be continually
					embellished, as they passed from hand to hand, till the small mixture of truth
					in them was scarcely discoverable. </p>
            <p>The first Gothic romances appeared under the venerable guise of history. <ref target="people.html#Arthur">Arthur</ref> and the knights of the round table,
						<ref target="people.html#Charlemagne">Charlemagne</ref> and his peers, were
					their favourite heroes. The extended empire of <ref target="people.html#Charlemagne">Charlemagne</ref> and his conquests
					naturally offered themselves as subjects for recital; but it seems extraordinary
					that <ref target="people.html#Arthur">Arthur</ref>, a British prince, <pb n="9"/> the scene of whose exploits was in Wales, a country little known to the rest
					of Europe, and who was continually struggling against ill-fortune, should have
					been so great a favourite upon the continent. Perhaps, however, the comparative
					obscurity of his situation might favour the genius of the composition, and the
					intercourse between Wales and Brittany would contribute to diffuse and
					exaggerate the stories of his exploits. In fact, every song and record relating
					to this hero was kept with the greatest care in Brittany, and, together with a
					chronicle deducing Prince <ref target="people.html#Arthur">Arthur</ref> from
					Priam king of Troy, was brought to England about the year 1100, by <ref target="people.html#MapWalter">Walter Mapes</ref> archdeacon of Oxford, when

					and his exploits were <pb n="11"/> greatly to the taste of the early romance
					writers. The Crusades kindled a taste for romantic adventure; the establishment
					of the Saracens in Spain had occasioned a large importation of genii and
					enchantments, and Moorish magnificence was grafted upon the tales of the Gothic
					chivalry. Of these heroic romances, the Troubadours were in France the chief
					composers: they began to flourish about the end of the tenth century. They by
					degrees mingled a taste for gallantry and romantic love with the adventures of
					heroes, and they gave to that passion an importance and a refinement which it
					had never possessed among the ancients. It was a compound of devotion,
					metaphysics, Platonism, and chivalry, making altogether such a mixture as the
					world had never seen before. There is something extremely mysterious in the
					manner in which ladies of rank allowed themselves to be addressed by these
					poetical lovers; sometimes no doubt a real passion was produced, and some
					instances there are of its having had tragical consequences: but in general it
					may be suspected that the addresses of the Troubadours and other poets were
					rather a tribute paid to rank than to beauty; and that it was customary for
					young men of parts, who had their fortune to make, to attach themselves to a
					patroness, of whom they made a kind <pb n="12"/> of idol, sometimes in the hopes
					of rising by her means, sometimes merely as a subject for their wit. The manner
					in which <ref target="people.html#ElizabethIQueenofEngland">Queen
						Elizabeth</ref> allowed herself to be addressed by her courtiers, the
					dedications which were in fashion in <ref target="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</ref>'s time, the letters of <ref target="people.html#Voiture">Voiture</ref>, and the general strain of poetry of <ref target="people.html#WallerEdmund">Waller</ref> and <ref target="people.html#CowleyAbraham">Cowley</ref>, may serve to prove that
					there may be a great deal of gallantry without any passion. It is evident that,
					while these romance writers worshiped their mistress as a distant star, they did
					not disdain to warm themselves by meaner and nearer fires; for the species of
					love or rather adoration they professed did not at all prevent them from forming
					connexions with more accessible fair ones. Of all the countries on the
					continent, France and Spain had the greatest number of these chivalrous
					romances. In Italy the genius of the nation and the facility of versification
					led them to make poetry the vehicle of this kind of entertainment. The Cantos of
						<ref target="people.html#BoiardoMatteo">Boiardo</ref> and <ref target="people.html#Ariosto">Ariosto</ref> are romances in verse. </p>
            <p>In the mean time Europe settled into a state of comparative tranquillity [sic]:

					of the day, and romances founded upon them had begun to be insipid when the
					immortal satire of <ref target="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</ref> drove
					them off the <pb n="13"/> field, and they have never since been able to rally
					their forces. The first work of entertainment of a different kind which was
					published in France (for the <hi rendition="#italics">

               </hi> of <ref target="people.html#RabelaisFrancois">Rabelais</ref> is rather a piece of

               </hi> of <ref target="people.html#UrfeHonored">M.
						d'Urfé</ref>. It is a pastoral romance, and became so exceedingly
					popular, that the belles and beaux of that country assumed the airs and language
					of shepherds and shepherdesses. A Celadon (the hero of the piece) became a
					familiar appellation for a languishing lover, and men of gallantry were seen
					with a crook in their hands, leading a tame lamb about the streets of Paris. The
					celebrity of this work was in great measure owing to its being strongly seasoned
					with allusions to the intrigues of the court of <ref target="people.html#HenryIVKingofFrance">Henry the Fourth</ref>, in whose
					reign it was written. The volumes of <hi rendition="#italics">

					in which if a man looks, he sees, if he is beloved, the face of his mistress;
					but if not, he is presented with the countenance of his rival: long languishing
					speeches and little adventures of intrigue fill up the story. It is interspersed
					with little pieces of poetry, very tolerable for the time, but highly
					complimentary. One of them turns upon the incident of the poet's mistress
					having burnt her cheek with her curling iron; on which he takes occasion to say,
						"<hi rendition="#italics">that the fire of her eyes caused the

					folds and recesses: its little vanities and affectations as well as its finer
					feelings. He abounds in wit, but it is of a refined kind, and requires thought

            <p>At the head of writers of this class stands the seductive, the passionate <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref>,—the most

					aim, as far as he had a moral aim, seems to have been to give a striking example

            <p>There is one species of this composition which may be called the <hi rendition="#italics">Didactic Romance</hi>, which they have particularly

					that it dared to attack the fondness for war and the disposition to <pb n="23"/>

					state, and the final recovery and happiness of all sentient beings,—are to
					be found in the mythological systems of all nations. <ref target="people.html#RamsayAndrewMichael">Ramsay</ref> was a Scotchman by

					the dead before they are received to the honours of sepulture, and the various
					ordeals of the initiation, are very striking. A high and severe tone of morals
					reigns through the whole, and indeed both this and the last-mentioned are much
					too grave for the readers of romance in general. That is not the case with the
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Belisaire</title>

					with the graver labours of the encyclopedists in diffusing sentiments of
					toleration, a spirit of free inquiry, and a desire for equal laws and good
					government over Europe. Happy, if the mighty impulse had permitted them to stop
					within the bounds of justice and moderation! The French language is well
					calculated for eloquence. The harmony and elegance of French prose, the taste of
					their writers, and the grace and amenity which they know how to diffuse over
					every subject, give great effect to compositions of this kind. When <hi rendition="#italics">we</hi> aim at eloquence in prose, we are apt to become
					turgid. <ref target="people.html#Florian">Florian</ref>, though a feeble writer,
					is not void of merit. His <hi rendition="#italics">

            <p>There is one objection to be made to these romances founded on history, which is,

						<pb n="25"/> a prince, and that, for some reason or other, he entered into

					little, fiction may say much: events and men that are dimly seen through the
					obscurity of remote periods and countries, may be illuminated with these false
					lights; but where history throws her light steady and strong, no artificial
					colouring should be permitted. Impressions of historical characters very remote
					from the truth, often remain on the mind from dramatic compositions. If we
					examine into our ideas of the Henries and Richards of English history, we shall
					perhaps find that they are as much drawn from <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</ref> as from <ref target="people.html#HumeDavid">Hume</ref> or <ref target="people.html#RapindeThoyras">Rapin</ref>. Some of our English

            <p>Among the authors of preceptive novels, <ref target="people.html#agenlisStephanie">Mad. Genlis</ref> stands very high. Her <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Adele et Théodore</title>
               </hi> is a system of education,
					the whole of which is given in action; there is infinite ingenuity in the
					various illustrative incidents: the whole has an air of the world and of good
					company; to an English reader it is also interesting as exhibiting traits of
					Parisian manners and modern manners, from one who was admitted into the first
					societies. A number of characters are delineated and sustained with truth and
					spirit, and the stories of <hi rendition="#italics">Cecile</hi> and the <hi rendition="#italics">Duchesse de C.</hi> are uncommonly interesting and well
					told, while the sublime benevolence of M. and Mad. Lagaraye presents a cure for
					sorrow worthy of a <pb n="27"/>
               <ref target="people.html#HowardJohn">Howard</ref>. From the system of <ref target="people.html#agenlisStephanie">Mad. Genlis</ref> many useful hints may
					be gathered, though the English reader will probably find much that differs from
					his own ideas. A good bishop, as <ref target="people.html#HuetPierreDaniel">Huet</ref> relates, conceiving of love as a most formidable enemy to
					virtue, entertained the singular project of writing, or procuring to be written,
					a number of novels framed in such a manner as to inspire an antipathy to this
					profane passion. <ref target="people.html#agenlisStephanie">Madame Genlis</ref>
					seems to have had the same idea; and in this manual of education, love is
					represented as a passion totally unfit to enter the breast of a young female;
					and in this, and in all her other works, she invariably represents as ending in
					misery, every connexion which is begun by a mutual inclination. The parent, the
					mother rather, must dispose of her daughter; the daughter must be passive; and
					the great happiness of her life, is to be the having in her turn a daughter, in
					whose affections <hi rendition="#italics">she</hi> is to be the prime object.
					Filial affection is no doubt much exaggerated by this writer. It is not natural
					that a young woman should make it an indispensable condition of marrying an
					amiable young man, that he will not separate her from her mother. We know in
					England what filial affection is, and we know it does not rise so high, and we
					know too that it ought not. There is another <milestone unit="signature" n="d 2"/>
               <pb n="28"/> objection to <ref target="people.html#agenlisStephanie">Mad.
						Genlis</ref>' system of education, which applies also to <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Emile</title>
               </hi>, which is, that it is too
					much founded upon deception. The pupil never sees the real appearance of life
					and manners: the whole of his education is a series of contrived artificial
					scenery, produced, as occasion demands, to serve a particular purpose. Few of
					these scenes would succeed at all; a number of them certainly never would.
					Indeed <ref target="people.html#agenlisStephanie">Mad. Genlis</ref> is not very
					strict in the point of veracity. A little fibbing is even enjoined to Adele
					occasionally on particular emergencies. <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Les
							Veillées du Chateau</title>
               </hi>, by the same author, has great
					merit. A number of other productions which have flowed from her pen witness her
					fertility of invention and astonishing rapidity of execution: their merit is
					various; all have great elegance of style: but it is observable, that in some of
					her later novels, she has endeavoured to favour the old order of things, to make
					almost an object of worship of <ref target="people.html#LouisXIVKingofFrance">Louis the Fourteenth</ref>, and to revive the reverence for monastic
					seclusion, which, with so much pathos, she had attacked in her charming story of

					some of the situations are very striking; and the passion of love is expressed
					in such a variety of turns and changes, and with so many refined delicacies of
					sentiment, that it is surprising how any language could, and surely no language
					could but the French, find a sufficient variety of phrases in which to dress her
					ideas.—Yet this novel cannot be called a pleasing one. One monotonous
					colour of sadness prevails through the whole, varied indeed with deeper or
					lighter shades, but no where presenting the cheerful hues of contentment and
					pleasure. A heavier accusation lies against this work from its tendency, on
					which account it has been said that the author was desired by the present
					sovereign of France to leave Paris; but we may well suspect that a scrupulous
					regard to morality had less share than political motives in such a prohibition.

            <p>The Germans, formerly remarkable for the laborious heaviness and patient research

					we were familiarized in this country: we received it through the medium of a
					French translation. It is highly pathetic, but its tendency has been severely,
					perhaps justly, censured; yet the author might plead that he has given warning
					of the probable consequences of illicit and uncontrolled passions by the awful
					catastrophe. It is certain, however, that the impression made is of more

            </p>
            <p>About fifty years ago a very singular work appeared, somewhat in the guise of a
					novel, which gave a new impulse to writings of this stamp; namely, <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Life and Opinions of Tristram
						Shandy</title>
               </hi>, followed by <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The
							Sentimental Journey</title>
               </hi>, by the rev. Mr. <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref>, a clergyman of York. They
					exhibit much originality, wit, and beautiful strokes of pathos, but a total want
					of plan or adventure, being made up of conversations and detached incidents. It
					is the peculiar characteristic of this writer, that he affects the heart, not by
					long drawn tales of distress, but by light electric touches which thrill the
					nerves of the reader who possesses a correspondent sensibility of frame. His
					characters, in like manner, are struck out by a few <pb n="41"/> masterly
					touches. He resembles those painters who can give expression to a figure by two
					or three strokes of bold outline, leaving the imagination to fill up the sketch;
					the feelings are awakened as really by the story of <hi rendition="#italics">Le
						Fevre</hi>, as by the narrative of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>
               </hi>. The
					indelicacies of these volumes are very reprehensible, and indeed in a clergyman
					scandalous, particularly in the first publication, which however has the richest
					vein of humour. The two <hi rendition="#italics">Shandys</hi>, <hi rendition="#italics">Trim</hi>, <hi rendition="#italics">Dr. Slop</hi>, are
					all drawn with a masterly hand. It is one of the merits of <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref> that he has awakened the
					attention of his readers to the wrongs of the poor negroes, and certainly a
					great spirit of tenderness and humanity breathes throughout the work. It is
					rather mortifying to reflect how little the power of expressing these feelings
					is connected with moral worth; for <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref> was a man by no means attentive to the happiness of those
					connected with him: and we are forced to confess that an author may conceive the
					idea of "brushing away flies without killing them,"<hi rendition="#sup">

            <p>It has lately been said that <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref> has been indebted for much of his wit to <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#BurtonRobert">Burton</ref>'s <title>Anatomy of Melancholy</title>
               </hi>. He certainly
					exhibits a good deal of reading in that and many other books out of the common
					way, but the wit is <milestone unit="signature" n="e 3"/>
               <pb n="42"/> in the
					application, and that is his own. This work gave rise to the vapid effusions of
					a crowd of sentimentalists, many of whom thought they had seized the spirit of
						<ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref>, because they could
					copy him in his breaks and asterisks. The taste spread, and for a while, from
					the pulpit to the playhouse, the reign of sentiment was established. Among the
					more respectable imitators of <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref> may be reckoned Mr. <ref target="people.html#MackenzieHenry">Mackenzie</ref> in his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Man of
							Feeling</title>
               </hi> and his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Julia de

               </hi> and Mr. <ref target="people.html#PrattSamuelJackson">Pratt</ref> in his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Emma Corbett</title>
               </hi>. </p>
            <p>An interesting and singular novel, <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Fool of
							Quality</title>
               </hi>, was written by <ref target="people.html#BrookeHenry">Henry Brooke</ref>, a man of genius, the
					author of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Gustavus Vasa</title>
               </hi> and many
					other productions. Many beautiful and pathetic episodical stories might be
					selected from it, but the story runs out into a strain romantic and improbable
					beyond the common allowed measure of this kind of writing; so that as a whole it
					cannot be greatly recommended: but it ought not to be forgotten that the very
					popular work of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Sandford and Merton</title>
               </hi>
					is taken from it. It has not merely given the hint for that publication; but the
					plan, the contrasted character of the two boys, and many particular incidents
					are so closely copied, that it will hardly be thought by one who peruses them
					both together, that <pb n="43"/> Mr. <ref target="people.html#DayThomas">Day</ref> has made <hi rendition="#italics">quite</hi> sufficient
					acknowledgement in his preface. <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref> had about this time awakened the public attention to the
					preference of natural manners in children, in opposition to the artificial
					usages of fashionable life; and much of the spirit of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Emile</title>
               </hi> is seen in this part of the work. The present
					generation have been much obliged to Mr. <ref target="people.html#DayThomas">Day</ref> for separating this portion of the novel from the mass of
					improbable adventure in which it is involved, clothing it in more elegant
					language, and giving those additions which have made it so deservedly a
					favourite in the juvenile library. The religious feelings are often awakened in
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Fool of Quality</title>
               </hi>, not indeed
					without a strong tincture of enthusiasm, to which the author was inclined.
					Indeed, his imagination had at times prevailed over his reason before he wrote
					it. </p>
            <p>A number of novels might be mentioned, which are, or have been, popular, though
					not of high celebrity. <ref target="people.html#FieldingSarah">Sarah
						Fielding</ref>, sister to <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">the author

                     <title>Tom Jones</title>

               </hi>
					is the most esteemed: she was a woman of good sense and cultivation; and if she
					did not equal her brother in talent, she did not, like him, lay herself open to
					moral censure. She translated <ref target="people.html#Xenophon">Xeno-</ref>
               <pb n="44"/>
               <ref target="people.html#Xenophon">phon</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">Socrates</hi>, and wrote a very pretty book for children, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Governess</hi>, or <hi rendition="#italics">Female Academy</hi>
               </title>. </p>
            <p>Many tears have been shed by the young and tender-hearted over <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Sidney Biddulph</title>
               </hi>, the production of
						<ref target="people.html#SheridanFrances">Mrs. Sheridan</ref>, the wife of
					Mr. <ref target="people.html#SheridanThomas">Thomas Sheridan</ref> the lecturer,
					an ingenious and amiable woman: the sentiments of this work are pure and
					virtuous, but the author seems to have taken pleasure in heaping distress upon
					virtue and innocence, merely to prove, what no one will deny, that the best
					dispositions are not always sufficient to ward off the evils of life. Why is it
					that women when they write are apt to give a melancholy tinge to their
					compositions? Is it that they suffer more, and have fewer resources against
					melancholy? Is it that men, mixing at large in society, have a brisker flow of
					ideas, and, seeing a greater variety of characters, introduce more of the
					business and pleasures of life into their productions? Is it that humour is a
					scarcer product of the mind than sentiment, and more congenial to the stronger
					powers of man? Is it that women nurse those feelings in secrecy and silence, and
					diversify the expression of them with endless shades of sentiment, which are
					more transiently felt, and with fewer modifications of delicacy, by the other
					sex? The remark, <pb n="45"/> if true, has no doubt many exceptions; but the
					productions of several ladies, both French and English, seem to countenance it. </p>
            <p>
               <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Callistus, or The Man of Fashion</title>
               </hi>, by
						<ref target="people.html#MulsoThomas">Mr. Mulso</ref>, is a pathetic story;
					but it is written entirely for moral effect, and affords little of
					entertainment. Mr. <ref target="people.html#agravesRichard">Graves</ref>, an
					author of a very different cast, is known in this walk by <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Columella</title>
               </hi> and his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Spiritual Quixote</title>
               </hi>. The latter is a
					popular work, and possesses some humour; but the humour is coarse, and the
					satire much too indiscriminately levelled against a society whose doctrines,
					operating with strong effect upon a large body of the most ignorant and vicious
					class, must necessarily include in their sweeping net much vice and folly, as
					well as much of sincere piety and corresponding morals. The design of his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Columella</title>
               </hi> is less exceptionable. It
					presents a man educated in polite learning and manners, who, from a fastidious
					rejection of the common active pursuits of life, rusticates in a country
					solitude, grows morose and peevish, and concludes with marrying his maid; no
					unusual consequence of a whimsical and morose singularity; the secret springs of
					which are, more commonly, a tincture of indolence and pride than superiority of
					genius. Mr. <ref target="people.html#agravesRichard">Graves</ref> was brought up
					originally for physic, but took orders and became <pb n="46"/> rector of
					Claverton near Bath. He was the author of several publications, both
					translations and original; he was fond of writing, and published what he
					entitled his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Senilities</title>
               </hi> when at the
					age of near ninety. He died in 1804.—But it is time to retire from the
					enumeration of these works of fancy, or the reader might be as much startled
					with the number of heroes and heroines called up around him, as Ulysses was with
					the troops of shades that came flocking about him in the infernal regions.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </quote> with such-like reasons equally grave and dignified. For my own
					part, I scruple not to confess that, when I take up a novel, my end and object
					is entertainment; and as I suspect that to be the case with most readers, I
					hesitate not to say that entertainment is their legitimate end and object. To
					read the productions of wit and genius is a very high pleasure to all persons of
					taste, and the <pb n="47"/> avidity with which they are read by all such shows
					sufficiently that they are calculated to answer this end. Reading is the
					cheapest of pleasures: it is a domestic pleasure. Dramatic exhibitions give a
					more poignant delight, but they are seldom enjoyed in perfection, and never
					without expense and trouble. Poetry requires in the reader a certain elevation
					of mind and a practised ear. It is seldom relished unless a taste be formed for
					it pretty early. But the humble novel is always ready to enliven the gloom of
					solitude, to soothe the languor of debility and disease, to win the attention
					from pain or vexatious occurrences, to take man from himself, (at many seasons
					the worst company he can be in,) and, while the moving picture of life passes
					before him, to make him forget the subject of his own complaints. It is pleasant
					to the mind to sport in the boundless regions of possibility; to find relief
					from the sameness of every-day occurrences by expatiating amidst brighter skies
					and fairer fields; to exhibit love that is always happy, valour that is always
					successful; to feed the appetite for wonder by a quick succession of marvellous
					events; and to distribute, like a ruling providence, rewards and punishments
					which fall just where they ought to fall.</p>
            <pb n="48"/>
            <p>It is sufficient therefore as an end, that these writings add to the innocent
					pleasures of life; and if they do no harm, the entertainment they give is a
					sufficient good. We cut down the tree that bears no fruit, but we ask nothing of
					a flower beyond its scent and its colour. The unpardonable sin in a novel is
					dullness: however grave or wise it may be, if its author possesses no powers of
					amusing, he has no business to write novels; he should employ his pen in some
					more serious part of literature. </p>
            <p>But it is not necessary to rest the credit of these works on amusement alone,
					since it is certain they have had a very strong effect in infusing principles
					and moral feelings. It is impossible to deny that the most glowing and
					impressive sentiments of virtue are to be found in many of these compositions,
					and have been deeply imbibed by their youthful readers. They awaken a sense of
					finer feelings than the commerce of ordinary life inspires. Many a young woman
					has caught from such works as <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi> or <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Cecilia</title>
               </hi>, ideas of delicacy and refinement which
					were not, perhaps, to be gained in any society she could have access to. Many a
					maxim of prudence is laid up in the memory from these stores, ready to operate
					when occasion offers.</p>
            <pb n="49"/>
            <p>The passion of love, the most seductive of all the passions, they certainly paint
					too high, and represent its influence beyond what it will be found to be in real
					life; but if they soften the heart they also refine it. They mix with the
					natural passions of our nature all that is tender in virtuous affection; all
					that is estimable in high principle and unshaken constancy; all that grace,
					delicacy, and sentiment can bestow of touching and attractive. Benevolence and
					sensibility to distress are almost always insisted on in modern works of this
					kind; and perhaps it is not too much to say, that much of the softness of our
					present manners, much of that tincture of humanity so conspicuous amidst all our
					vices, is owing to the bias given by our dramatic writings and fictitious
					stories. A high regard to female honour, generosity, and a spirit of
					self-sacrifice, are strongly inculcated. It costs nothing, it is true, to an
					author to make his hero generous, and very often he is extravagantly so; still,
					sentiments of this kind serve in some measure to counteract the spirit of the
					world, where selfish considerations have always more than their due weight. In
					what discourse from the pulpit are religious feelings more strongly raised than
					in the prison sermon of <hi rendition="#italics">

            <p>But not only those splendid sentiments with which, when properly presented, our
					feelings readily take part, and kindle as we read; the more severe and homely
					virtues of prudence and œconomy have been enforced in the writings of a
						<ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Burney</ref> and an <ref target="people.html#EdgeworthMaria">Edgeworth</ref>. Writers of their good
					sense have observed, that while these compositions cherished even a romantic
					degree of sensibility, the duties that have less brilliancy to recommend them
					were neglected. Where can be found a more striking lesson against unfeeling

					affectation,—all those faults and blemishes which undermine family

					fancy are thus made subservient to the improvement of the rising generation,
					they certainly stand on a higher ground than <pb n="51"/> mere entertainment,
					and we revere while we admire. </p>
            <p>Some knowledge of the world is also gained by these writings, imperfect indeed,
					but attained with more ease, and attended with less danger, than by mixing in
					real life. If the stage is a mirror of life, so is the novel, and perhaps a more
					accurate one, as less is sacrificed to effect and representation. There are many
					descriptions of characters in the busy world, which a young woman in the retired
					scenes of life hardly meets with at all, and many whom it is safer to read of
					than to meet; and to either sex it must be desirable that the first impressions
					of fraud, selfishness, profligacy and perfidy should be connected, as in good
					novels they always will be, with infamy and ruin. At any rate, it is safer to
					meet with a bad character in the pages of a fictitious story, than in the
					polluted walks of life; but an author solicitous for the morals of his readers
					will be sparing in the introduction of such characters.— It is an aphorism

               <pb n="52"/> Indeed the former assertion is
					not true without considerable modifications. If presented in its naked
					deformity, vice will indeed give disgust; but it may be so surrounded with
					splendid and engaging qualities, that the disgust is lost in admiration.
					Besides, though the selfish and mean propensities are radically unlovely, it is
					not the same with those passions which all have felt, and few are even desirous
					to resist. To present these to the young mind in the glowing colours of a <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref> or a <ref target="people.html#StaelGermainede">Madame de Stael</ref> is to awaken and
					increase sensibilities, which it is the office of wise restraint to calm and to
					moderate. Humour covers the disgust which the grosser vices would occasion;
					passion veils the danger of the more seducing ones. </p>
            <p>After all, the effect of novel-reading must depend, as in every other kind of
					reading, on the choice which is made. If the looser compositions of this sort
					are excluded, and the sentimental ones chiefly perused, perhaps the danger lies
					more in fixing the standard of virtue and delicacy too high for real use, than
					in debasing it. Generosity is carried to such excess as would soon dissipate
					even a princely fortune; a weak compassion often allows vice to escape with
					impunity; an overstrained delicacy, or regard to a rash vow, is allowed to mar
					all the prospects of a long <pb n="53"/> life: dangers are despised, and self is
					annihilated, to a degree that prudence does not warrant, and virtue is far from
					requiring. The most generous man living, the most affectionate friend, the most
					dutiful child, would find his character fall far short of the perfections
					exhibited in a highly-wrought novel. </p>
            <p>Love is a passion particularly exaggerated in novels. It forms the chief interest
					of, by far, the greater part of them. In order to increase this interest, a
					false idea is given of the importance of the passion. It occupies the serious
					hours of life; events all hinge upon it; every thing gives way to its influence,
					and no length of time wears it out. When a young lady, having imbibed these
					notions, comes into the world, she finds that this formidable passion acts a
					very subordinate part on the great theatre of the world; that its vivid
					sensations are mostly limited to a very early period; and that it is by no
					means, as the poet sings,<quote>

					duty, by prudence, or merely by a regard for <milestone unit="signature" n="f 3"/>
               <pb n="54"/> the show and splendour of life; and that in fact it has a
					very small share in the transactions of the busy world, and is often little
					consulted even in choosing a partner for life. In civilized life both men and
					women acquire so early a command over their passions, that the strongest of them
					are taught to give way to circumstances, and a moderate liking will appear
					apathy itself, to one accustomed to see the passion painted in its most glowing
					colours. Least of all will a course of novels prepare a young lady for the
					neglect and tedium of life which she is perhaps doomed to encounter. If the
					novels she reads are virtuous, she has learned how to arm herself with proper
					reserve against the ardour of her lover; she has been instructed how to behave
					with the utmost propriety when run away with, like <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>
               </hi>, or locked up by
					a cruel parent, like <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>
               </hi>; but she is not
					prepared for indifference and neglect. Though young and beautiful, she may see
					her youth and beauty pass away without conquests, and the monotony of her life
					will be apt to appear more insipid when contrasted with scenes of perpetual
					courtship and passion. </p>
            <p>It may be added with regard to the knowledge of the world, which, it is allowed,
					these writings are calculated in some degree to give, that, let them <pb n="55"/> be as well written and with as much attention to real life and manners as
					they can possibly be, they will in some respects give false ideas, from the very
					nature of fictitious writing. Every such work is a <hi rendition="#italics">whole</hi>, in which the fates and fortunes of the personages are brought
					to a conclusion, agreeably to the author's own preconceived idea. Every
					incident in a well written composition is introduced for a certain purpose, and
					made to forward a certain plan. A sagacious reader is never disappointed in his
					forebodings. If a prominent circumstance is presented to him, he lays hold on
					it, and may be very sure it will introduce some striking event; and if a
					character has strongly engaged his affections, he need not fear being obliged to
					withdraw them: the personages never turn out differently from what their first
					appearance gave him a right to expect; they gradually open, indeed; they may
					surprise, but they never disappoint him. Even from the elegance of a name he may
					give a guess at the amenity of the character. But real life is a kind of
					chance-medley, consisting of many unconnected scenes. The great author of the
					drama of life has not finished his piece; but the author must finish his; and
					vice must be punished and virtue rewarded in the compass of a few vo- <pb n="56"/> lumes; and it is a fault in <hi rendition="#italics">his</hi> composition if
					every circumstance does not answer the reasonable expectations of the reader.
					But in real life our reasonable expectations are often disappointed; many
					incidents occur which are like "passages that lead to nothing,"<hi rendition="#sup">

					and characters occasionally turn out quite different from what our fond
					expectations have led us to expect. </p>
            <p>In short, the reader of a novel forms his expectations from what he supposes
					passes in the mind of the author, and guesses rightly at his intentions, but
					would often guess wrong if he were considering the real course of nature. It was
					very probable, at some periods of his history, that <hi rendition="#italics">Gil

               </hi> if a real character, would come to be hanged;
					but the practised novel-reader knows well that no such event can await the hero
					of the tale. Let us suppose a person speculating on the character of <hi rendition="#italics">Tom Jones</hi> as the production of an author, whose
					business it is pleasingly to interest his readers. He has no doubt but that, in
					spite of his irregularities and distresses, his history will come to an
					agreeable termination. He has no doubt but that his parents will be discovered
					in due time; he has no doubt but that his love for <hi rendition="#italics">Sophia</hi> will be rewarded sooner or later with her hand; he has no <pb n="57"/> doubt of the constancy of that young lady, or of their entire
					happiness after marriage. <hi rendition="#sup">

						</note>
               </hi> And why does he foresee all this? Not from the real tendencies
					of things, but from what he has discovered of the author's intentions. But
					what would have been the probability in real life? Why, that the parents would
					either never have been found, or have proved to be persons of no
					consequence—that <hi rendition="#italics">Jones</hi> would pass from one
					vicious indulgence to another, till his natural good disposition was quite
					smothered under his irregularities—that <hi rendition="#italics">Sophia</hi> would either have married her lover clandestinely, and have
					been poor and unhappy, or she would have conquered her passion and married some

            <p>Though a great deal of trash is every season poured out upon the public from the
					English presses, yet in general our novels are not vicious; the food has neither
					flavour nor nourishment, but at least it is not poisoned. Our national taste and
					habits are still turned towards domestic life and matrimonial happiness, and the
					chief harm done by a circulating library is occasioned by the frivolity of its
					furniture, and the loss of time incurred. Now and then a girl perhaps may be led
					by them to elope with a coxcomb; or, if she is handsome, to expect the homage of
					a <hi rendition="#italics">Sir Harry</hi> or <hi rendition="#italics">My
						lord</hi>, instead of the plain tradesman suitable to her situation in life;
					but she will not have her mind contaminated with such scenes and ideas as <ref target="people.html#Crebillonfils">Crebillon</ref>, <ref target="people.html#LouvetdeCouvray">Louvet</ref>, and others of that class
					have published in France. </p>
            <p>And indeed, notwithstanding the many paltry books of this kind published in the
					course of every year, it may safely be affirmed that we have more good writers
					in this walk living at the present time, than at any period since the days of
						<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richard-</ref>
               <pb n="59"/>
               <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">son</ref> and <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>. A very great proportion
					of these are ladies: and surely it will not be said that either taste or morals
					have been losers by their taking the pen in hand. The names of <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">D'Arblay</ref>, <ref target="people.html#EdgeworthMaria">Edgeworth</ref>, <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</ref>, <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Radcliffe</ref>, and a number more will
					vindicate this assertion. </p>
            <p>No small proportion of modern novels have been devoted to recommend, or to mark
					with reprobation, those systems of philosophy or politics which have raised so
					much ferment of late years. Mr. <ref target="people.html#HolcroftThomas">Holcroft</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Anna St.
						Ives</title>
               </hi> is of this number: its beauties, and beauties it certainly
					has, do not make amends for its absurdities. What can be more absurd than to
					represent a young lady gravely considering, in the disposal of her hand, how she
					shall promote the greatest possible good of the system? Mr. <ref target="people.html#HolcroftThomas">Holcroft</ref> was a man of strong
					powers, and his novels are by no means without merit, but his satire is often
					partial, and his representations of life unfair. On the other side may be
					reckoned <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The modern Philosophers</title>
               </hi>,
					and the novels of <ref target="people.html#WestJane">Mrs. West</ref>. In the war
					of systems these light skirmishing troops have been often employed with great
					effect; and, so long as they are content with fair, general warfare, without
					taking aim at individuals, are perfectly allowable. We have lately <pb n="60"/>
					seen the gravest theological discussions presented to the world under the
					attractive form of a novel, and with a success which seems to show that the
					interest, even of the generality of readers, is most strongly excited when some
					serious end is kept in view. </p>
            <p>It is not the intention in these slight remarks to enumerate those of the present
					day who have successfully entertained the public; otherwise Mr. <ref target="people.html#CumberlandRichard">Cumberland</ref> might be mentioned,
					that veteran in every field of literature; otherwise a tribute ought to be paid
					to the peculiarly pathetic powers of <ref target="people.html#OpieAmelia">Mrs.

               </hi>,

					feelings on which these stories generally turn, has kept up the curiosity and

                  <title>St. Leon</title>
               </hi>, the ingenious speculation

					never-ending life in this world: but in fact it does not bear at all upon the
					question, for no one ever did wish for im- <pb n="61"/> mortal life without
					immortal youth to accompany it, the one wish being as easily formed as the
					other; but <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>St. Leon</title>
               </hi> shows, from a

					unhappy being. </p>
            <p>With regard to this particular selection, it presents a series of some of the
					most approved novels, from the first regular productions of the kind to the
					present time: they are of very different degrees of merit; but none, it is
					hoped, so destitute of it as not to afford entertainment. Variety in manner has
					been attended to. As to the rest, no two people probably would make the same
					choice, nor indeed the same person at any distance of time. A few of superior
					merit were chosen without difficulty, but the list was not completed without
					frequent hesitation. Some regard it has been thought proper to pay to the taste
					and preference of the public, as was but reasonable in an undertaking in which
					their preference was to indemnify those who are at the expense and risk of the
					publication. Copyright also was not to be intruded on, and the number of volumes
					was determined by the booksellers. Some perhaps may think that too much
					importance has been already given to a <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left">
