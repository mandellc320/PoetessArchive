               <hi rendition="#smcaps">he</hi> great first cause
					why our English literature has obtained so high a character for truth and nature
					is, that it has always reflected, as in a mirror, the age which was passing over
					it. The chivalric romances were filled with the spirit of their times. The
					dramas, with their passionate poetry and rich variety of incident, were
					transcripts of their own wild and adventurous day. The Revolution next left its
					mental imprint. <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref> embodied the
					stern energy of resistance which had been in action, while the satire of

               </hi> and the light and licentious comedies
					which followed, were no less faithful pictures of the wit and profligate
					indulgence which then prevailed. The ensuing age was one of political intrigue
					rather than of excitement. It equally gave its literary tone. People reasoned
					rather than felt, were moral by maxims, and witty in antithesis. The genius of
					style was abroad. Observation was just rather than profound, keen rather than
					deep. Wit was carried to its perfection, and also to its excess; people were
					witty on every thing. Essays, letters, satires, sermons, were the circulating
					coin. The novels, excellent in plot, coarse, but vigorous in delineation of
					character, were comedies put into narrative, their merits and their defects
					equally of their actual period. This cycle also revolved, and its successor was
					one of wild imagination and strong passion. The few paint the feeling of the
					many; and the many adopt such words as if they were their own. The great
					writers, we can scarcely say of our time, embodied the excitement, the morbid
					sensibility, the visionary philosophy, the melancholy ever attendant upon
					imaginative feeling, which were the characteristics of an essentially poetical
					age; and such was the one just departed. Another great change is now passing
					over our literature, because it is also passing over our time; not less
					powerful, though perhaps less marked. The former change was more violent; it was
					wrought by enthusiasm, which, for the time, carries all before it. The present
					is being worked by opinion, which, if more still, is also more lasting. To-day
					has nothing in common with Yesterday. People required to be amused in order to
					be instructed; now, they only permit themselves to be entertained while laying
					the flattering unction to their souls that it is the vehicle of information. For
					every why, we ask a wherefore. We will not allow an author to display his
					talents merely as the knights broke each other's limbs of old, for honour:
					we expect that he should have a purpose in this display, and that purpose one of
					tangible benefit. It is this that makes the excellence of the writer before us.
					With that keen perception of reality, which is the executive power of genius, he
					has entered into the spirit of his own times. Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> is the first novelist
					who has placed his best reward, and his great aim, in the utility of his
					writings. He has seen, that in order to improve, we must first enlighten; and
					that ridicule, if not the test of truth, is, at least, a good conductor to its
					lightning. His genius has taken service with reality. In every event he has
					wrought out, in every character he has created, he has never had the actual <pb n="438"/>out of mind; and his works are living pictures, filled with the
					crimes and the virtues, the thoughts and the feelings, the hopes and the fears
					which are now among us in daily operation. Young, rich, and high-born, Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>

							Bulwer, of Heydon Hall, Norfolk, by Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress
							of Richard Warburton Lytton, of Knebworth Park, Herts. Both these are
							very ancient families. The Bulwers have possessed lands still held by

							been the property of the Lyttons since the reign of Henry VII., when it
							passed into the hands of the first De Lytton, of Lytton, in Derbyshire,
							Treasurer to that King, and Governor of Boulogne Castle. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Mr. E. Lytton Bulwer</ref>

							Bulwer</ref>'s family is connected, by ancient intermarriages, with
							some of the most distinguished in England—viz. the De Greys,

               </hi> lacked many of the ordinary excitements to exertion. It
					is a fact not to be disputed, that the aristocracy have not
					"progressed" in proportion to the other classes. A young nobleman of
					the present day has not a better education than his ancestor in the time of <ref target="people.html#ElizabethIQueenofEngland">Elizabeth</ref>. If we look
					back to the old records, we shall find that the classics, the modern tongues,
					some knowledge of philosophy, and the information collected by foreign travel,
					were held indispensable to the formation of a gentleman. What more is now
					required among the higher ranks? We doubt whether even as much be effected. It
					would seem that education, in ceasing to be a distinction, had lost half its
					attraction. The evaded study and dissipation of a public school is succeeded by
					the equally evaded study and dissipation of a college; and too many of our
					youthful aristocracy begin life with self-sufficiency for knowledge, prejudices
					for opinions, and with pleasure a habit rather than an enjoyment. The great
					error of their condition is, that their road through life is too royal a one,
					using that phrase quite in its ancient acceptation. We must remember, that to
					this class Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>
					belongs, in order to do justice to the enegy of mind which has so nobly
					preferred exertion to indulgence, and has set out by acknowledging the general
					sympathies, and advocating the general rights of mankind. In the history of an
					author, it is labour wasted to inquire what first turned his mind to its
					peculiar pursuit. Even if the fact could be ascertained, it would be useless as
					an example, for no circumstance affects two men alike; and if brought forward
					only to support a theory, the theory which cannot be carried into action is
					rather ingenious than useful. That the subject of our sketch was early addicted
					to reading is nothing; so are thousands, from whose labour fruit never comes.
					Literary taste is often confounded with literary talent by others, quite as much
					as by ourselves. The Cambridge prize poem on Sculpture, afterwards published in
					a small volume of poems, printed for private circumstance, was his first
					literary effort.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> is essentially imbued
					with the spirit of poetry: perhaps, born a few years sooner, he would have been
					a poet only; but, though circumstances do not make genius, they certainly have
					much to do with its direction. He had early read largely, and seen much of
					society: his judgment thus <pb n="439"/>balanced his imagination, and the same
					accuracy of observation which has since shown itself to be one of his most
					characteristic merits, told him, that the celebrity of one age must be sought in
					an opposite path by its successor. We had been rich in poetry, even to luxury;
					and when has not luxury led to satiety? Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>'s literary career

					your head," replied the executioner; he did so, and it rolled on the
					scaffold. The matter-of-fact man, believing the story up to this point, says,
					"Well, did he give him the fifty ducats?" In this <hi rendition="#italics">point device</hi> spirit were the coxcombries of
						"<title>Pelham</title>," arraigned. "Perfumes,

					people." "Feeding his poodle on chicken and sweet-breads!—what
					wicked waste, when there are so many poor starving." But wit cuts its
					bright way through the glass-door of public favour; and
						"<title>Pelham</title>," took its station, not only as a most
					entertaining novel, but as a satire, equally just, keen, and amusing. By the
					way, it is curious to remark how the affectations of one age are made up of the
					affectations of its predecessors: our present has gone back upon classical
					materials. What is its indifference, but stoicism made small for common use; its
					indolence, but a copy of the Lacedemonian, who, when an Athenian had been fined
					for idleness, requested to be introduced to the gentleman, "who had been
					punished for keeping up his dignity;" its gourmandism is but the luxury,
					without the magnificence of the Roman; and, as for perfumes, there was an
					ancient sage who perfumed his feet instead of his hair. "In the one
					case," as he justly observed, "the grateful odours ascended to his own
					nostrils, while, in the other instance, the sweetness but exhaled in the general
					air." Pelham was an incarnation of the spirit of the times, only with some
					fine talents and high qualities not quite so general. But the author's own
					words, in the preface to the second edition, best set forth his intentions. </p>

               </hi> The most singular
					characteristic about these works is their utter dissimilitude: save in a general
					tone of benevolence, as the basis of philosophy, and an extended and liberal
					view of the general interests of mankind, these productions are striking
					contrasts. "<title>Pelham</title>," was a moral Diorama—a view
					of London, as it is. "<title>The Disowned</title>" was a poetical and
					imaginative picture, but not the less true because the colours were created and
					combined rather than copied. It is not, perhaps, fair to ascribe your own
					supposed plan to an author, but we have always thought that "<title>The
						Disowned</title>" was the finest illustration of ambition
					possible—an illustration, too, of its many varieties. The desire of
					honourable but worldly success in Clarence, is brought into fine contrast with
					the dreaming and feverish desire of fame which consumes the young artist. Again,
					the disinterested but fatal patriotism of Wolfe, fatal because confined, is
					admirably opposed to that of Algernon Mordaunt, whose patriotism takes the
					ground-work of knowledge, and works hand in hand with philosophy and charity.
					Mordaunt is one of those ideals of excellence which we respect an author for
					conceiving. "<title>The Disowned</title>" also developed a new talent,
					that of description: there are several landscapes as beautiful and as English as
					those of our natural painter <ref target="people.html#CollinsWpainter">Collins</ref>. As an analysis of cause and effect, the history of Mr.
					Talbot, the vain man, is a perfect specimen of moral dissection. His vanity is
					the opposite of Lord Boradail's conceit. Vanity and conceit are often
					confounded: nevertheless, they are very opposite qualities; as much difference
					as there is between search and possession; vanity craves "golden
					opinions" from all ranks of men; conceit sits down quietly in the enjoyment
					of its own property. More poetical in its views, more elevated in its
					philosophy, the remarks scattered through "<title>The
					Disowned</title>," though less worldly, are not less true than those in its
					predecessor. They take a higher, though not a less actual tone; and we doubt if
					the sarcastic inference be a whit more accurate than the kindlier one. The
					difference between their observations is, that in <pb n="442"/> the one they are
					taken in the spirit of satire; in the other, they are taken in that of
					philosophy. If "<title>Pelham</title>," and the
						"<title>Disowned</title>" were different,
						"<title>Devereux</title>" was equally opposed to either. For
					ourselves, we are free to confess that "<title>Devereux</title>" is
					our favorite of all Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>'s works. It is at once an historical, a philosophical,
					and a poetical novel. The historical scenes have that which is usually admitted
					as the great merit of historical fiction, verisimilitude—if not exactly
					what people did do, it was exactly what they might be supposed to have done: to
					use a theatrical phrase, the illusion is well supported. But they have also
					another great and peculiar merit, the lesson pointed for the apprehension of
					even the most careless reader. Moral knowledge is the fine gold extracted from
					the crucible of moral satire. The interview between the Czar and Devereux is an
					admirable and forcible exposition of a great truth: we allude to the scene where
					the influence of shame in punishment is illustrated by the difference between
					the Russian and the German, while under the discipline of the knout.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> The same remark may apply to the inimitable
					scenes in Paris. The spirit of that age of epigrams was never so caught by an
					English writer before. But we draw no false inferences: the dust is
					diamond-dust, and it sparkles;—it is not thrown in our eyes. We see that
					it was a time equally witty and worthless; and the same glance which takes in

					Historical personages have often lent "the magic of a name" to the

					philosophical investigation, and the fellow-feeling of a noble mind being
					devoted to embody, and to appreciate the merits of one to whom historians (we
					will not say history) have shown scant mercy and less justice. The various
					conversations in which <ref target="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Bolingbroke</ref> takes part, the just observations which throw such light
					on his sentiments, the eloquent appreciation of his excellence, the clear
					reasoning on his motives, are the perfection (if we may use such a phrase) of
					dramatic biography. Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> himself says, "that to do justice to a great man is the
					highest of literary pleasures;" and in this analysis of <ref target="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Bolingbroke</ref>, we know not
					which most to admire, the truth of the defence, or the generous warmth of the
					defender. The tomb of one great man is the altar of another. One very futile
					objection against this noble impersonation has been urged by the Chinese of
					criticism, or rather its Chancery barristers, who refer every thing to
					precedent;—that, forsooth, "a novel is not the proper place for
					political or historical discussion." Why, we would ask, is truth to be
					debarred from taking its most effective, because most popular form? Such critics
					are either strangely behind, or wilfully blind, to their own time, who deny the

							swallows all the others.</note>
               </hi> which has swallowed up the rest. If
					a few great writers choose any one vehicle for their talent, hundreds of their
					inferiors will choose the same mode, and follow in the track in which they never
					could have led. We do firmly believe great popularity is <pb n="443"/> never
					gained without great desert. All will admit, that the first-rate talent of our
					time has been developed in the novel. It is an error to say, that this is
					because it is the most amusing; it is rather because it is the most appropriate.
					Still, in literature, as in life, the sins of the fathers are visited upon the
					children, even unto the third and fourth generation; and works, like <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s, which have done more
					towards giving us real ideas of the days of yore, and drawn closer the links of
					the past and present, than any chronicle ever written; or works like <ref target="people.html#agodwinWilliam">Godwin</ref>'s, and these of the
					author now before us, full of the most important truths, are to receive for
					their heritage the ill name of works in which, if the scene were laid in former
					days, a dungeon, a beauty, white plumes and iron fetters, a little valour, and a
					great deal of love, (love <hi rendition="#italics">à l'impossible en

					modern life, the lover first raked, and then reformed; the heroine was first
					miserable and then married. Such was the circulating cycle, and hence the novel
					was held, nay, is still held by many, to be the Paria of literature. Truly may
					it be said, that to change an opinion is difficult; but to remove a prejudice is
					impossible. Before we resume our analysis, we cannot but remark on the singular
					silence preserved towards the most rising author of their day, in the two

					Clifford</title>."</p>
            <p> To return to "<title>Devereux</title>." The character of the hero
					seems to us to be one of Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>'s most powerful and original conceptions: the influence
					of circumstances upon nature is finely and profoundly traced.
						"<title>Devereux</title> is imaginative, affectionate, passionate by
					nature; worldly, cold, and guarded in his crust of circumstance. The poetry
					inherent, and the philosophy acquired, are exquisitely developed. We never could
					read the account of his boyhood without the most intense interest,—the
					warm love of the child thrown back upon itself by unkind coldness and unjust
					preference. We shall only say, fortunate are those who do not sympathize with
					the affectionate, yet unloved boy, whose heart becomes sullen as sadness always
					does when utterly unshared. There is terrible injustice in the treatment of
					children: how arbitrary is the authority exercised over them! How much does the
					anger or the fondness lavished upon them depend on the temper of the moment!
					What a contradiction between the much we expect them to acquire, and the little
					we expect them to observe! At one time they are to learn all that demands
					comprehension and industry,—(think how much pure abstract knowledge a
					child is expected to master;) and then, at another period, they are treated like
					a machine, that neither sees nor hears; or, at least, seeing and hearing as one
					who understandeth not; saving that memory is a most faithless faculty, a mirror
					in which a man looks, and "straightway forgetteth what manner of man he
					is," or was. Our own experience might teach us a different lesson. But
					preference, and its consequence, neglect, is the child's most cruel wrong.
					The bitter feeling of comparing our own lot with another's, will come quite
					soon enough without its being taught in infancy. Early injustice is like the
					thread of silk planted with the tulip—it colours all the after leaves. Its
					influence runs through all Devereux's future character; the warm emotions
					concealed—the affectionate temper checked—restraint deepening into
					reserve, and self-dependance hardening into self-reliance, are all traced with
					the accuracy of an anatomist, and with a beauty even beyond their truth. The
					awakening of all his better nature under the affection of his uncle, and that
					kind old uncle himself, are transcripts from one of the very best and dearest
					pages of human life. As for Sir William, we do not insist upon every reader
					liking him as much as we do ourselves; but we must own, if they do not, we shall
					have a very bad opinion of them. It is curious to mark the likeness of position
					and the dissimilarity of character between Pelham and Devereux: both are young,
					noble, panting, first, for pleasure, next for worldly distinction; and both are
					fops, "mandarins of the first class;"<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot">An idiom indicating a man with long nails; thus one with
							feminine or refined grooming habits.</note>
               </hi> but still how
					different. Pelham's worldliness is the philosophy of his calm, calculating,
					yet high nature: that of Devereux, on the contrary, is a disguise and a
					security. The coxcombry of Pelham is like a cast from his features; that of
					Devereux is a mask to his face. The difference is imagination in the one, the
					want of it in the other. This is especially shown in their love: —love,
					which if but an episode in the active life of man, is a lasting influence in his
					ideal one. We do not think the most susceptible <pb n="445"/> reader is very
					unquiet about the success of Pelham's suit: we think the very coldest must
					be touched by Devereux's generous and devoted attachment to the beautiful
					and desolate Spanish girl. Love was never more passionate in <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>, more true in <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref>, more lovely in
					nature, than it is here "gently bodied forth." We have hitherto dwelt
					on other merits than the rich passionate colours given by the heart. But the
					whole history of Isora is touched by that poetical spirit, which does not, it is
					true, make nature more beautiful than nature often is, but shows that beauty in
					its fairest light, the light of imagination. There is, to us, something
					inexpressibly touching in Devereux's abiding affection, when, to quote an
					exquisite passage from the "<title> Milton</title>" in after-years,<hi rendition="#sup">

            <p> "<title>Paul Clifford</title>" came next; as different to its brethren
					as if they had not had "one common father." </p>
            <p> "<title>Paul Clifford</title>" is at once a political satire, a
					romance of middle life; a practical and moral treatise, put forth in the popular
					form of a novel. The satire is levelled at existing persons and abuses—the
					romance is the poetry which passion and feeling extract from the daily events of
					common life—the moral is that drawn from the temptation which leads, and
					the punishment which follows, the crimes we know to be hourly committed. For the
					first time, Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> seems
					to have felt what an engine of power was the novel for present utility; how
					forcibly it could be brought to play on the vice whose result is
					misery—the indolence whose result is injury, and the selfishness which is
					at once its own best and worst punishment. What leading-article in a review ever
					brought forward the evil influence of laws, that punish rather than guard, upon
					the lower classes, with such energy and truth as the dramatic exposition of
					their hardship and insufficiency in "<title>Paul Clifford</title>?" It
					is a great and noble distinction for an author (and we know no other modern
					novelist that can "lay the flattering unction to his soul"<hi rendition="#sup">

					in the hope of <pb n="446"/> pointing attention to great abuses—to awful
					suffering. The feelings, the weaknesses, the wretchedness of a great body of my
					countrymen have been utterly neglected; to their benefit I dedicate my
					talents—the spirit of 'Paul Clifford' is the cause of the
					people." As a matter of taste, we have owned to liking
						"<title>Devereux</title>" the best; but as matter of principle, we
					give the preference to " <title>Paul Clifford</title>." The use of the
					last is more actual and immediate. </p>
            <p> Whether in lively satire, keen remark, or accurate reflection—whether in
					deducing the character from circumstance—whether in painting the nice
					distinction of natural good feeling which favourable position ripens into
					virtue, or natural strong passion, or weakness, which events harden into
					crime—the desire of benefit from an obvious lesson, or practical inference
					necessarily drawn by the reader, the same desire of conferring a moral benefit
					on the author's kind is paramount through all. Fiction is the eloquence of
					experience, and to be useful it must be actual. The character of William

					is as yet our author's most powerful conception. The lava-flood of passion,
					which bursts in one red flood, chills, hardens—never to melt
					again—the evil knowledge brought by too early experience (for experience
					may come too soon—the fruit must be mature that the east wind will not
					injure); the bitter consciousness of surpassing talent, unused and
					useless—the pride, which though inherent in the nature, has no outward
					cause of display, and takes refuge and fights under the shield of
					scorn—passion, talent, and knowledge—these best gifts of our kind,
					and yet those that may be turned to the worst purpose—never were these
					more finely developed than in William Brandon. One single touch of human
					kindliness in this proud and cold man is in his gentle and fatherly love for
					Lucy, his orphan niece. It may seem fanciful, but it has always reminded us of

					and loveable one, till circumstances discover that gold lies beneath the stream
					which had hitherto only "broke into dimples and laughed in the sun."
					It is the "unconquerable strength of love," giving its own force to a
					nature essentially timid and feminine. One of the great merits of this work is
					the many slight touches, which, like the finishings of a portrait, give such
					identity to a picture. The descriptions are singularly accurate, from that of
					the small and most wretched streets in London on a wet night, to the ancient
					manor-house with its one old chestnut tree "worth a forest." The
					affections delineated are such as are in constant play, brightening and
					sweetening from the lofti- <pb n="447"/> est to the lowest; while the deeper
					colouring of passion is terrible from its truth. The scattered observations are
					as valuable for their justice as they are remarkable for their acuteness. Take

					are anonymous are usually abusive, and want of principle and want of

					criticism:—the first to speak, not of the author, but of his works; his
					pages, not himself, are amenable to your remarks: secondly, to do away with the
					present anonymous system; this would have a double advantage; it would force the
					critic to be just, if not generous, for his own sake—for men weigh
					opinions for which they are to be instantly answereable; and also, when the
					critic is known, the public would be able to judge, from previous knowledge of
					what he had himself done, how far he was competent to decide on the labours of

               </hi> We can have
					nothing to say that will better apply to this poem. We have heard the term
					satire objected to, as applied to "<title>The Siamese Twins</title>;"
					we confess it does not belong to the Sunday-newspaper school of satirists, in
					which real names and nicknames, personality and brutality constitute what is
					called a powerful article; but if abuse is not the whole of wit, to
					wit—the keen and the ready—this poem may well lay claim. If Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> wants any thing, it is
					that innate gaiety, which in a writer, like good spirits in a companion, carries
					us along with it. Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>'s serious satire is more apparent than his more playful vein,
					simply because the one has, and the other has not, the impress of his own mind.
					Nothing, especially in poetry, divides opinion more than great originality;
					readers are at fault when no good old rule is at hand to serve as a
					guage—and when at a loss, it is always safest to condemn. To be the first
					to praise requires more self-reliance than the generality of people possess, and
					the "<title>Siamese Twins</title>" is too different <pb n="449"/> from
					its predecessors for early opinions to be safely trusted to walk alone. But its
					feelings and its thoughts, "the deep and the true," daily become more
					familiar; the fine passage is remembered—the exquisite expression
					quoted—and the laurel puts forth its green boughs, leaf by leaf, till it
					stands forth a stately tree. This poem is dedicated to his mother—genius
					making affection as beautiful in expression as it is in spirit. We cannot
					conceive a more touching tribute. Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>'s father died when
					he was but three years of age, and the care of his education<hi rendition="#sup">

            <p> We have now, as far as our power extends, done our duty (for what is justice but
					a duty?) to this extraordinary writer. If we have cordially expressed our
					admiration, it is because we have cordially felt it. We have neither attempted
					to detail the stories nor describe the characters; the meagre sketch of a tale,
					or the bare outline of a character, is as a skeleton, which requires to be
					clothed in flesh before it can rise up in grace or beauty. We have endeavoured
					to give our own strong impression—to select some of the most detachable
					merits, and then to say to our readers, judge for yourselves on the right of our
					opinion, bearing in mind that we can set forth only a very small part of sixteen
					volumes, full of all the various developement of mind and feeling. </p>
            <p> A transition from the author's works to the author's self has been a
					common consequence of fame in all ages. Though we do not quite go the length of
					the Genevese, who, publishing an account of <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref>'s visit to his
					native city, deems it worthy of mention that <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Jean Jacques</ref> wore a cap
					trimmed with fur, but that he would not decide whether it was lined with fur or
					not, for he never took it off: still, by that rule which leads us to judge of
					others' feelings by our own, we think the curiosity, personal though it be,
					about a distinguished author, is, to say the least, very excusable. We often
					hear complaints that the author does not sustain the <hi rendition="#italics">beau ideal</hi> of his hero; this complaint, at least, cannot be made of
					Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref>. His appearance is
					distinguished, his features chiselled and regular, and the whole expression of
					his face highly intellectual as well as handsome. Generally, though we confess
					to having but a slight personal knowledge, Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> is silent and reserved
					in society; but this may in some measure arise from his extreme distaste to
					mixing with it: for at times nothing can exceed the flashing wit of his gayer
					converse, unless it be the originality and interest of his more serious
					discourse. Mr. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</ref> is
