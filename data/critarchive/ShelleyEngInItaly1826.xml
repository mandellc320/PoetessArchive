				<p rendition="#pnoindent"><hi rendition="#largest">W</hi>HEN peace came, after many
					long years of war, when our island prison was opened to us, and our watery exit
					from it was declared practicable, it was the paramount wish of every English
					heart, ever addicted to vagabondizing, to hasten to the continent, and to
					imitate our forefathers in their almost forgotten custom, of spending the
					greater part of their lives and fortunes in their carriages on the post-roads of
					the continent. With the brief and luckless exception of the peace of Amiens,<hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">March 1802-May 1803.
							&quot;Luckless&quot; because short lived, this period offered a brief
							reprise from &quot;long years of war&quot; with France from 1793 until
							the capture and temporary exile of <ref target="people.html#Napoleon"
								>Napoleon</ref> in 1814. <ref target="people.html#Napoleon"
								>Napoleon</ref> escaped from exile in February 1815 and was only
							finally defeated in June of the same year.</note></hi> the continent had
					not been open for the space of more than one-and- twenty years; a new generation
					had sprung up, and the whole of this, who had money and time at command, poured,
					in one vast<pb n="326"/> stream, across the Pas de Calais into France: in their
					numbers, and their eagerness to proceed forward, they might be compared to the
					Norwegian rats, who always go right on, and when they come to an opposing
					stream, still pursue their route, till a bridge is formed of the bodies of the
					drowned, over which the living pass in safety. The simile holds good in more
					ways than one: the first emigrants, it is true, were not wholly killed, but the
					miseries they endured, of dirty packets and wretched inns, were the substratum
					from which has arisen the elegant steam-packet, and the improved state of the
					continental hotels. But in those early days of migration, in the summer of 1814,
					every inconvenience was hailed as a new chapter in the romance of our travels;
					the worst annoyance of all, the Custom-house, was amusing as a novelty; we saw
					with extasy the strange costume of the French women, read with delight our own
					descriptions in the passport, looked with curiosity on every <hi
						rendition="#italics">pl&#226;t</hi>, fancying that the fried-leaves of
					artichokes were frogs; we saw shepherds in opera-hats, and post-boys in
					jack-boots; and (<hi rendition="#italics">pour comble de merveille</hi><hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">To crown the wonder.</note></hi>) heard
					little boys and girls talk French: it was acting a novel, being an incarnate
					romance. But these days are now vanished: frequent landings at Calais have
					deprived it of its captivating novelty. Many of our children, under the guidance
					of foreign nursery-maids, lisp French as well as any little wood-shod urchin
					among the natives. We have learned to curse the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>douane</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Customs
							checkpoint.</note></hi> and denounce passports as tyrannical and
					insufferable impediments to our free progress.</p>
				<p>When France palled on our travelled appetites, which always crave for something
					new, Italy came into vogue. As preparatives for our pilgrimage to that county,
					whose charm is undying, we devoured the fabulous descriptions of <ref
						target="people.html#EustaceJohnChetwode">Eustace</ref>, and well-poised
					sentences of <ref target="people.html#ForsythJoseph">Forsyth</ref>, and a
					traveller from Italy inspired us almost with devotional respect. We do not think
					that we are guilty of any exaggeration when we affirm, that even now that the
					English are almost cloyed with foreign travel, a journey to Italy is still
					regarded with enthusiastic transport, and when visited, that country is quitted
					with greater regret than any other, and the peculiarity of its situation
					accounts for this. We all wish to burst our watery bound, and to wander in
					search of a more genial climate than that enjoyed (according to the vulgarism,
						<hi rendition="#italics">he enjoys a very bad state of health</hi>) by our
					native land. Neither France, Germany, nor Switzerland, content the swallow
					English. La belle France is now acknowledged to be the most unpictuesque, dull,
					miserable-looking country in the world. The name of Germany is sufficient in
					itself to inspire a kind of metaphysical gloom, enlightened only <pb n="327"/>by
					meteoric flashes from the Hartz or the Elbe. Passing the Jura, surrounded by the
					mighty Alps, we ramble delightedly over Switzerland, till the snow and ice,
					ushered in by the chilling Biz, cause us to escape from the approach of a winter
					more severe than our own. We fly to Italy; we eat the lotus; we cannot tear
					ourselves away. It is the land of romance, and therefore pleases the young; of
					classic lore, and thus possesses charms for the learned. Its petty states and
					tiny courts, with all the numerous titles enjoyed by their frequenters, gild it
					for the worldly. The man of peace and domesticity finds in its fertile soil, and
					the happiness of its peasantry, an ameliorated likeness of beloved but starving
					England. The society is facile; the towns illustrious by the reliques they
					contain of the arts of ancient times, or the middle ages; while its rural
					districts attach us, through the prosperity they exhibit, their plenteous
					harvests, the picturesque arrangement of their farms, the active life every
					where apparent, the novelty of their modes of culture, the grace which a sunny
					sky sheds over labours which in this county are toilsome and unproductive.</p>
				<p>This preference accorded to Italy by the greater part of the emigrant English has
					given rise to a new race or sect among our countrymen, who have lately been
					dubbed Anglo-Italians. The Anglo-Italian has many peculiar marks which
					distinguish him from the mere traveler, or true <ref
						target="people.html#JohnBull">John Bull</ref>. First, he understands
					Italian, and this rescues himself from a thousand ludicrous mishaps which occur
					to those who fancy that a little Anglo-French will suffice to convey
					intelligence of their wants and wishes to the natives of Italy; the record of
					his travels is no longer confined, according to <ref
						target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord Normanby</ref>&apos;s vivid
					description, to how he had been &quot;starved here, upset there, and robbed
					every where&quot; [<title><hi rendition="#italics">The English in
						Italy</hi></title>, vol. ii. p. 229]<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"
							>Shelley&apos;s reference.</note></hi>. Your Anglo-Italian ceases to
					visit the churches and palaces, guide-book in hand; anxious, not to see, but to
					say that he has seen. Without attempting to adopt the customs of the natives, he
					attaches himself to some of the most refined among them, and appreciates their
					native talent and simple manners; he has lost the critical mania in a real taste
					for the beautiful, acquired by a frequent sight of the best models of ancient
					and modern art.</p>
				<p>Upon the whole, the Anglo-Italians may be pronounced a well-informed, clever, and
					active race; they pity greatly those of their un-Italianized countrymen, who are
					endowed with <ref target="people.html#Spurzheim">Spurzheim</ref>&apos;s bump,
					denominated stayathomeativeness; and in compassion of their narrow experience
					have erected a literature calculated to disseminate among them a portion of that
					taste and knowledge acquired in the Peninsula. <ref

					considered the father of the Anglo-Italian literature, and

								target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>&apos;s 1818 comic poem
							set in Venice.</note></hi> as being the first product of that school;
						<ref target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord Normanby</ref> brings
					up the rear. The plan of his work, entitled, &quot;<title>The English in
						Italy</title>&quot; is excellent. It is difficult, after a long residence in
					a foreign country, to collect one&apos;s variety of experience into one focus.
					The detached anecdotes and observations on manners, made at various periods and
					places, are grouped in the mind, while it is impossible to select any form of
					journal, letter, or narrative, which will combine the mass in an intelligible
					form, and cause the reader to seize, as the author did, the conclusions to be
					drawn from such multifarious materials. Besides, though mere travellers are
					culpably negligent on this score, the resident Anglo-Italian is withheld by
					honour, from the exposition of facts and names. <ref
						target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">Lord Normanby</ref> has hit upon
					a medium both novel and entertaining. He has given a series of tales, in which
					the English and Italians alike figure; the contrast between the two nations adds
					to the interest of these sketches, while the colouring of fiction is thrown over
					truths, which it would be difficult to convey in any other manner. It is
					impossible to read &quot;<title>The English in Italy</title>&quot; without being
					struck at every page with the verity of the delineations of character and
					manners, and without admiring the skill with which the noble author has seized
					and expressed the slight shadowings, and evanescent lights, peculiar to the
					complicated form of Italian society, which must have escaped a ruder pen. We
					frequently, it is true, dissent from his lordship&apos;s opinions and
					conclusions, but we always assent to the truth of his facts.</p>
				<p>The first (and it is the best) of his longer stories is entitled
						<title>L&apos;Amoroso</title>. It is the tale of a high-bred English girl,
					who, enchanted with the beauty of Naples, the softness of its climate, the
					vivacious and easy tone of society, and the ardour of her Italian lover,
					sacrifices her first <hi rendition="#italics">half</hi> love (first loves are,
					for the most part, we fear, half loves), and gives her hand to a Neapolitan
					count. The gradual development of her Italian husband&apos;s feelings, her
					awakening to the truth of her situation, and the growth of her despair, is
					admirably managed; yet in all this there is something besides the comparative
					merits of English and Italian domestic customs. We can none of us attempt, with
					impunity, to engraft ourselves on foreign stocks: the habits of our childhood
					cling to us, and we seek in vain for symapthy from those who have travelled life
					quite on a different road from that which we have followed. We are far from
					advocating the Italian conjugal system, which puts the axe to domestic
					happiness, and deeply embitters the childhood of the <pb n="329"/> offspring of
					the divided parents; nevertheless, we must observe, that the misery suffered by
					the English girl in Italy would on other accounts, but in no minor degree,
					become the lot of an Italian married to an Englishman. Let us imagine the
					daughter of a Neapolitan noble, dragged from her beautiful country and sunny
					clime, deprived of her box at the opera, her ride on the Corso, her cort&#232;ge
					of devoted servants, her circle of complaisant friends, her <hi
						rendition="#italics">dolce far niente</hi>;<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">Pleasant idleness.</note></hi> to the toils and dulness of
					an English home&#8212;to the cares of housekeeping&#8212;a charge not imposed on
					Italian females&#8212;her snug, but monotonous, fire-side, her sentry-box of a
					house; to our cloudy sky; to the labour of giving dinners and entertaining
					evening parties; to those numerous etiquettes easy to the natives, unattainable
					by foreigners; to the <hi rendition="#italics">sotto voce</hi><hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Soft voice or undertone.</note></hi>
					tone (if the metaphor be admissible) which characterizes our social intercourse,
					to the necessity of for ever wearing that thick and ample veil of propriety
					which we throw over every act and word: introduce the ardent, simple-hearted,
					undisguising Italian to this world, so opposite to her own, and she would
					experience the same heart-sickening disappointment that visited the heart of the
					heroine of the <title>Amoroso</title>. To us, and particularly to our females,
					these laws of constraint are the music, the accompaniment by which they regulate
					their steps until they cannot walk without it; and the veil before spoken of is
					as necessary to their sense of decency as their very habiliments. It is natural,
					therefore, that the English girl of the tale should be transfixed with grief at
					the request from her husband to conform with Italian customs; and it is also
					inevitable that the first step she takes in compliance with this request must
					sin against Italian etiquette, and, though liberty is offered her, that she
					should find that even the excess of freedom does not permit her the exact
					liberty she wants.</p>
				<p>The &quot;<title>Politico</title>&quot; contains a rapid but masterly sketch of
					the Piedmontese revolution. The author, it is true, judging only from the
					apparent effects, blames this sudden burst of impatience on the part of Italians
					any longer to bear their galling chains. He says, that they had better have
					waited a few years, as if the capacity of waiting did not engender a callousness
					to the evils of tyranny, incompatible with a generous love of liberty. The
					revolution ended unfortunately, it is true; but, most certainly, if the attempt
					had not been made, the Italians would have lost their characteristic of being
					slaves &quot;ognor frementi,&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"
							>Forever enraged; Shelley uses the phrase in <hi rendition="#italics"

						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">The Phanariotes were a highly skilled

					the smothered fire of this crushed revolt a brighter flame will hereafter rise:

						unit="signature" rendition="#smcaps" n="z"/><pb n="330"/>just then kindled
					by the Spaniards: both are quenched now, but not for ever.</p>
				<p>If the Italians could have viewed the Spanish struggle, and still submitted
					uncontending to the Austrian, they could never more have lifted their heads as a
					nation, nor possessed any claim to our commiseration. One of the chief causes,
					indeed, of the failure of the revolt of 1820-21 was political despair. This
					despair originated in the disarmed state of the natives, and the terror
					engendered by the Austrian bayonets. In every Italian state, except Tuscany,
					this fear was joined to a never-dying hatred of their oppressive rulers; which
					made them on the alert to seize every opportunity to rebel against their
					tyrants. While the flame of revolt spread from the Alps to Brundusium, Tuscany
					alone was tranquil. They talked of liberty, but their enthusiasm began and ended
					in talk. The grand duke appreciated so well the quiescence of his loving
					subjects, that when the Austrian minister presented him with a list of
					sixty-seven Carbonari worthy of incarceration, Ferdinand refused to look at it.
					He did not believe, he said, that these men were Carbonari, but he was sure if
					he imprisoned them they would become so. Who, indeed, were to form the patriotic
					band? Not the peasants: the idea of political liberty never entered their heads.
					They work hard, and their genial climate lightens their labour of all the misery
					which renders the peasant&apos;s life so irksome in this country; yet still,
					from the utter want of money and traffic, their hardest labour only enables them
					to labour on. In the cities neither the rich nor the poor are willing to risk
					their wealth or their safety. There is another class of persons, the men of
					letters and students at the universities. The first are peacefully inclined, the
					second unprincipled: they are ready for riot, but they are little fitted for any
					commotion which has for its aim a noble and enlightened purpose. Yet we do not
					think the emancipation of Italy far off. In one circumstance, Italy is far
					better situated than Spain&#8212;in case of a revolution. Religion is here no
					enemy of political liberty. Napoleon gave a blow to Italian superstition, from
					which it will never recover. By destroying the wealth of the priests, he has
					destroyed their influence. The higher classes are liberal in their opinions, and
					the little bigotry that subsists among the lower orders is wholly untinged by
					the spirit of persecution. The great and immoveable foundation-stone, the
					boundary mark of Italian liberty, which still subsists, though no superstructure
					is thereto added, is their natural talent. In spite of college restrictions, in
					spite of almost universal ignorance, their native genius flourishes; their
					untaught courtesy, their love for the fine arts, the <pb n="331"/>poetry with
					which their sunny sky endows them, prevent their being brutified; and this Italy
					possesses in her own bosom the germs of regeneration, which, in spite of their
					late overthrow, will in the end give birth to their emancipation. </p>
				<p>But to return to &quot;<title>The English in Italy</title>&quot; The
						&quot;<title>Sbarbuto</title>&quot; approaches nearest to a failure of any
					of the sketches; the hero is a kind of ideal of <ref

						soft.&quot;</note></hi> now going out of fashion, is introduced, and the
					mixed character of bandit and dandy is carried to its height. Truth of
					description and liveliness of narrative, two chief characteristics of this
					author, render even this strange anomaly interesting. The conclusion of the tale
					is singularly abrupt, but it may be observed that all <ref
						target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord Normanby</ref>&apos;s
					catastrophes are faulty; that of &quot;<title>Matilda</title>&quot; has been
					justly censured.<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Shelley perhaps refers

							associate of <ref target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry"
								>Normanby</ref>&apos;s publishers, Saunders and Otway.</note></hi>
					The author wished to pourtray the evils resulting from certain modes of action,
					and yet the tragic conclusion of the tale is entirely independent of the chain
					of unhappy events which were to appear of necessity to arise from the
					heroine&apos;s departure from the moral laws of her country. The conclusion of
					the &quot;<title>Sbarbuto</title>&quot; is still worse, and our imagination
					received a most disagreeable baulk, when, on turning the last page of this tale,
					we found that was indeed the last.</p>
				<p>The sketches called the &quot;<title>Zingari,</title>&quot; which detail a
					variety of adventures which have befallen the gipsy English in Italy, are
					perhaps the best part of the book. There is nothing outr&#233;, nothing of
					caricature in any of these portraits. We recognize many well-known faces, and at
					each successive narration remember a <hi rendition="#italics">pendant</hi> that
					has come within our own experience. Utter ignorance of the Italian language is
					the source of many of the ludicrous situations in which the English get
					involved. French does not, as has been said, carry the traveller through Italy;
					those who depend on it, will find their support fail them at the first Italian
					town they enter. Besides, the Italians speak French with peculiar awkwardness;
					they are unable to accentuate its unutterable consonants and slip-shod vowels.
					When an Italian has welcomed a foreigner with gravity, and even with sulkiness,
					answering their introduction with a few mispnounced French phrases, if replied
					to in their own language, their case of manner returns, and they become as
					graceful and facile in conversation as before they were repulsive.<hi

					case, further experience overthrows the minor one, and the discomforts and
					dangers which are the lot of an invalid traveler in Italy will change to
					comforts and safety, if he becomes a resident there. If, indeed, the invalid
					travel, like <ref target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord
						Normanby</ref>&apos;s hero, from one town to another, from one bad inn and
					cold lodging to another a match for the last, he may certainly return from such
					pursuit of health worse than he went. But let him fix on some city for a
					constant residence: Pisa we recommend as most equable in climate; let him get
					his English comforts about him, as he may with ease and cheapness from the free
					port of Leghorn, not twelve miles distant, and he will then find the advantage
					of a southern residence. The streets of Pisa are quiet, and the whole town wears
					a sober, scholastic aspect. The north side of the Lung Arno, looking towards the
					south, is warm at mid-winter, and always presents a delightful promenade. The
					rides round the town are beautiful; you have your choice of the pine forest of
					the Cascina, or the road along the plain that skirts the neighbouring hills,
					which, covered with olives, chestnuts, and last, toward their summit, with
					pines, are, though not high, remarkably picturesque. The whole road from Vico
					Pisano to Lucca, some twenty or thirty miles, presenting successive pictures of
					fertility in the plain, and of the view of ravine or precipice in the mountains,
					is within four miles of one or other of the gates of Pisa. The neighbourhood to
					the sea is an advantage not to be omitted. Let an invalid to this, and he will

				</p>
				<pb n="333"/>
				<p>We are surprised that <ref target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord
						Normanby</ref> has not introduced more of the country life of Italy, which
					bears a peculiar stamp, and which is pregnant with interest and beauty.
					Generally speaking, our countrymen see only the surface of the country, and are
					unaware of the minuti&#230; of the peasant&apos;s life, and their mode of
					agriculture. They are connoisseurs in paintings, and frequenters of
					drawing-rooms; but the inferior classes of their fellow beings possess no
					interest for them; and yet it is in the country of Italy that you see most of
					the true Italian character, and most enjoy the exhaustless delights of that
					sunny clime. The very aspect of the country to a cursory observer will prove
					this assertion. The use of oxen in their agricultural labours is seemingly a
					small, and yet, in truth, a great improvement to the picturesque of the rural
					scene. The oxen of Italy surpass, in beauty of form, in the sleekness of their
					dove-coloured skin, and the soft expression of their large eyes, all other
					animals of their species. In every part of Italy we encounter, during our walks,
					in lanes bordered by elms and sallows, to which the vines are trained and
					festooned, frequent wains drawn by these animals, yoked by the neck; and the
					dark-eyed driver, with his sun-burnt limbs, in no manner detracts from the
					beauty of the picture. It is curious in Italy to observe the great advantage the
					peasants possess as to personal appearance, over the town&apos;s-people. The
					inhabitants of the cities, whether rich or poor are for the most part low in
					stature, sallow-complexioned, bent shouldered; but if while you are induced, by
					the appearance of the citizens, to lament the degeneracy of Italian beauty, you
					wander in the country, or enter the market-place, to which, on certain days, the
					country people resort, you are immediately convinced that you now behold the
					models of the Italian painters. You are struck by groups resembling those fine
					fellows represented in the paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds. Their
					very occupation adds to their pictorial appearance. They are employed among the
					vines, or following the oxen-drawn plough, whose rough mechanism is such as <ref
						target="people.html#Virgil">Virgil</ref> describes; frequently in summer
					they work merely in a shirt, and the white colour of the linen contrasts well
					with limbs whose veins seem to flow with dark wine. The women, less hard-worked
					than the French <hi rendition="#italics">paysannes</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup"
							><note place="foot">Rustics or peasants.</note></hi> perform the lighter
					labours of the farm, and, notwithstanding the shade of their large straw-hats,
					soon acquire a<pb n="334"/>deep but healthy hue; in an evening they are seen
					returning from fetching water at the spring, bearing their pitchers of an
					antique shape on their heads, stepping freely under the burthen. Of course we do
					not pretend to say that all, or even that the greater part of them, are
					handsome; but they have, for the most part, pleasing expressions of countenance,
					and the beauty you do encounter is of a high character; their brows are finely
					moulded, their eyes soft and large; the cheeks sink gently towards the chin, and
					their lips remind you of those chiselled by Greek sculptors. Such we have seen
					in the evening emerging from the trellised <hi rendition="#italics"
						>pergole</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Arbor or
							trellis.</note></hi> or vine-walks, singing in perfect tune, and with
					clear, though loud voices, the simple but beautiful melodies peculiar to the
					Italian peasantry.</p>
				<p>It is true that, in thus eulogizing the country of Italy, our remarks must be
					understood as being principally confined to Tuscany. In Lombardy the abundance
					of pasture-land is inimical to the happiness of the peasantry; nor are we
					sufficiently acquainted with the rural districts of the Roman and Neapolitan
					states, to speak with precision concerning their inhabitants. In Tuscany the
					farms are usually small, and held at long leases; the rent is often paid in
					kind, and the landlord receives as his share one half of the produce. The
					expenses are also shared between the landholder and the cultivator, the former
					providing the heavy stock, cattle, ploughs, out-houses, wine-presses, &amp;c.;
					the peasantry the lighter utensils, and repairs of hedges, sluices, &amp;c. The
					smallness of the farms renders the farmer almost always the labourer; a hired
					workman is rare among them; and the cottager, we should almost call him, with a
					farm of twelve acres, whose family is sufficiently large to cultivate the land,
					and whose share of corn and wine suffices to maintain that family without extra
					purchase, considers himself rich; for, then, the superfluous money he obtains by
					the sale of vegetables, fruit, and the better kind of wine, clothes his family,
					and keeps his farm and house in repair. Their lives would be deemed, and justly
					deemed, hard in England, for our unbenign climate would render painful the
					continual out-door work, which is light to them.</p>
				<p>The Tuscan name for their small farms is <hi rendition="#italics">podere</hi>,<hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Farmsteads.</note></hi> and in
					appearance they resemble what we imagine to have been the first attempts at
					agriculture, every thing being cultivated in patches. A podere generally
					contains six or eight acres; they are hedged in; in the neighborhood of Leghorn
					the hedges are of myrtle, which, like all evergreens, are fragrant even when out
					of bloom; and when in flower, their spicy odour gives a taste of Indian climes.
					Little hay is raised, for the Indian <pb n="335"/> corn is much used in its
					stead; so after the spring-labour of pruning the vines, the wheat is the first
					harvest. The wheat-fields are planted with rows of trees, to which the vines
					cling; and the shade, far from being detrimental, is considered a shelter for
					the crops. When the wheat is gathered in, and threshed on the threshing-floor,
					constructed in the open air, with all the care that <ref
						target="people.html#Virgil">Virgil</ref> advises, the land is again sown
					with Indian corn. This is a beautiful harvest. The men cut it down, and the
					women and children sit round the threshing-floor, taking the grain from the pod,
					loosening it from the stalk, and spreading it in the sun, till its paler orange
					hue deepens to a fiery glow. The vintage follows&#8212;an universal feast. The
					men pluck the fruit from the trees, which is received and deposited in the vats
					by the women and children. The plucking of the olives brings up the rear of
					their <hi rendition="#italics">raccolte</hi>.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">Harvests.</note></hi> But it is not the mere sowing, and
					the harvests that demand labour; the long droughts force them to construct
					sluices through every part of the podere, and the water-wheel is for ever at
					work to irrigate the land; nature the while is busy and noisy. During the day
					the loud cicale, with ceaseless chirp, fill the air with sound, and in the
					evening the fire-flies come out from the myrtle hedges, and form a thousand
					changing and flashing constellations on the green corn-fields, which is their
					favourite resort. Meanwhile the <hi rendition="#italics">contadini</hi><hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Peasants or rustics.</note></hi> cheer
					themselves with songs, either singly, in harmony, or in response. One of the
					favourite games among the Tuscan peasants (we have forgotten the name of it),
					especially during the time of the vintage, is singularly poetic. A man on one
					tree, will challenge another perched afar off, calling out the name of a flower;
					the challenged responds with an extempore couplet, sometimes founded on the
					metaphoric meaning attached, of the flower&apos;s name, sometimes given at
					random, and then returns the challenge by naming another flower, which is
					replied to in the same manner. We have unluckily preserved but two of these
					impromptus, and they are both on the same flower:&#8212; <quote>

				<p>It is this exhaustless fertility that makes Italy a paradise, and affords
					never-ending variety of object to the residents. With us nature is parsimonious,
					if not frugal; her very magnificence is that of a well-regulated mansion, where,
					though great show is made, there is no waste. In Italy she superabounds,<pb

					winds. This abundance is not displayed alone in inanimate nature; but among the

					poets. The mode of his improvisation is wonderful, and different from the usual
					style of these exhibitions. When he comes on the stage, his personal appearance,
					animated countenance, and regular features, lost in his daily costume, strike
					you with admiration. It is the custom for those who choose, to leave at the door
					of the theatre a slip of paper, on which is written a subject for a tragic
					drama. We were present at three of these performances. The subject of the first
					was &quot;<title>Ifegenia in Tauride;</title>&quot; the plan of the tragedy was
					closely copied from <ref target="people.html#Euripides">Euripides</ref>; but the
					words and poetry were his own, and we were continually startled by images of
					dazzling beauty, and a flow of language which never degenerated into mere words,
					but, on the contrary, was instinct with energy and pathos.</p>
				<p><title>Inez de Castro</title> was a tragedy he gave at Lucca, the subject being
					imposed on him by the arch-duchess, who was in the theatre. When towards the
					end, he caused the audience to understand that the prince, Don Pedro, husband of
					Inez, drawing a curtain, suddenly displays to his father the bodies of his
					murdered wife and children, the same thrill was felt, nay, far greater than if
					the real mock bodies (the implied bull must be excused) had been brought
					forward. His words were so living, that you saw them, not decked out with stage
					trickery, but in the true livery of death, livid, stiff, and cold. The last
					tragedy we heard was the <title>Death of Hector</title>.<hi rendition="#sup"
							><note place="foot">The same subject was subsequently given him at
							Turin, and a short-hand writer took it down, and it was published. The
							plot resembled the one we heard, otherwise it struck us as inferior in
							poetry, and was certainly a very different production. The plot is not
							the least admirable part of these impromptu dramas. When a novel subject
							is given, it is of course arranged during the heat of inspiration and
							delivery; it never lags; the interest is continually increasing, and the
							scenes grow naturally from each other. They are shorter than our
							five-act plays, being, on the Greek plan, interspersed with choruses.

					walls of Troy, and heard mad Cassandra denouncing its fall. Speaking afterwards
					to the poet, he said that he did not remember much about any other part; but he
					had a vivid recollection that when he poured forth the ravings of the
					prophetess, he no longer saw the theatre; Troy was around him; Troy burning;
					Priam stabbed at his altar, and the women dragged lamenting away in chains. From
					all this magical creation of talent, what resulted? The poet himself forgets all
					his former imaginations, and is hurried on to create fresh imagery, while the
					effects of his former inspirations are borne away with the breath that uttered
					them, never again to be recalled&#8212; <quote><lg type="stanza">

				<p>Italy is an exhaustless theme to those who, having been long residents there, are
					familiar with its novel and beauteous aspect. But our limits warn us not to
					pursue our digression, and oblige us to turn our attention to those other works
					whose titles head our article. We shall not dilate much upon them; for the scope
					of our present writing is to treat of Italy, and as these volumes do not bear
					the same perfect Italian stamp as those of <ref
						target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">lord Normanby</ref>, they may be
					passed more cursorily over. </p>
				<p>&quot;<title>Continental Adventures</title>&quot; are the production of the very
					clever <ref target="people.html#EatonCharlotte">authoress of &quot;<title>Rome
							in the Nineteenth Century.</title></ref>&quot; This latter publication
					is an inestimable guide to all who visit the Eternal City, and even to those at
					home, more than any other work on the same subject, gives a faithful account of
					the wonders of that metropolis of the world. &quot;<title>Continental
						Adventures</title>&quot; is on another and a worse plan. It mixes real
					scenes with fictitious ones, not in the style of the &quot;<title>English in
						Italy,</title>&quot; where the manners of the natives form the ground-work
					of the tales, but in the mode of a common novel&#8212;a novel of the day: a lady
					and her lover, the baulks to love, the rival, and the denouement, all English:
					and the &quot;<title>Continental Adventures</title>&quot; are merely, that while
					the hero and heroine are <hi rendition="#italics">progressing</hi> towards the
					fulfillment of their hopes, they ramble about Switzerland, and the lady, in
					particular, endures so many perils, that we really think that no female in real
					life could have undergone them without becoming prematurely grey. She commences
					by breaking her collar-bone and two of her fingers;<pb n="338"/>is twice in
					imminent danger of perishing in snow-drifts; narrowly escapes tumbling down a
					precipice; is nearly shot by a robber in one of the Alpine Ravines; and last, is
					carried away by Italian banditti, at whose hands death was the least evil she
					expected, and from whom she saves herself by the administration of a piece of
					opium, which she had fortunately put into her <hi rendition="#italics"
						>pocket</hi> the day before. The story of the novel is commonplace enough,
					and the gordian knot, tied just at the end, then to be cut, is confused, and
					even displeasing. The discovery of relationship in a forbidden degree between
					lovers is always disagreeable; and the mode by which these lovers are found to
					be related, disfiguring the sacred associations always blended with a
					mother&apos;s name, is even revolting. The <ref
						target="people.html#EatonCharlotte">authoress</ref> is evidently nearly
					related to Scotland, though we believe she is not Scotch. She has a taste for
					humour, and her comedy is generally very entertaining, though she too often
					falls into a comedian&apos;s worst fault, of wire-drawing a comic scene, till it
					becomes tedious; and once or twice she is guilty of giving them for their
					foundation subjects hardly admissible on the score of propriety. The book is,
					however, written with great spirit, and is very entertaining. Some of the scenes
					of real life are sketched with fidelity and true humour. The
					C&#244;che-d&apos;Eau on the Rhone is one of these, and the Reverend Saunders
					M&apos;Muckleman is throughout a genuine comic character. Her descriptions of
					scenery are, however, the best part of the book; they are varied and faithful.
					We select one, as a specimen of the style in which they are executed:&#8212;</p>
				<quote><p>The glaciers of the Aar, which we visited from the Grimsel, present a
						scene which I am convinced the world cannot equal; which none who have
						beheld it can ever forget, and none who have not seen it can ever conceive.
						I will not mock you with a futile attempt at description. You cannot picture
						the scene; but you can form some idea of the awe-struck astonishment which
						filled our minds, when, after surmounting all the difficulties of the way,
						we found ourselves standing amidst a world of ice, extending around,
						beneath, above us; far beyond where the straining sight, in every direction,
						vainly sought to follow the interminable frozen leagues of glaciers, propped
						up in towering pyramids or shapeless heaps, or opening into yawning gulphs
						and unfathomable fissures. The tremendous barren rocks and mountains of the
						impenetrable Alps, amidst which the terrific Finsteraarhorn reared his
						granitic pyramid of fourteen thousand feet, appeared alone amidst this world
						of desolation. Eternal and boundless wastes of ice, naked and inaccessible
						mountains of rock, which had stood unchanged and untrodden from creation,
						were the only objects which met our view. Hitherto, with all we had seen of
						desolation and horror, there was some contrast, some relief. The glaciers of
						Chamouni are bordered by glowing harvests; the<pb n="339"/>glaciers of
						Grindelwald are bounded by its romantic vale; the glaciers of the Schiedeck
						shine forth amidst its majestic woods. Even among the savage rocks and
						torrents of the Grimsel, though animated life is seen no more, the drooping
						birch and feathery larch protrude their storm-beaten branches from the
						crevices of the precipices; and the lonely pine-tree is seen on high, where
						no hand can ever reach it. But here there is no trace of vegetation, no
						blade of grass, no bush, no tree; no spreading weed or creeping lichen
						invades the cold still desolation of the icy desert. It is the death of
						nature. We seemed placed in a creation in which there is no principle of
						life; translated to another orb, where existence is extinct, and where
						death, unresisted, holds his terrific reign. The only sound which meets the
						ear is that of the loud detonation of the ice, as it bursts open into new
						abysses, with the crash of thunder, and reverberates from the wild rocks
						like the voice of the mountain storms.&#8212;Vol. ii. p. 134,</p></quote>

				<p>These volumes contain the best description and guide to Switzerland that we have
					ever seen, but Italy makes only a small portion of them. We have some animated
					scenes on the romantic lake of Como, and visit, with the personages of the
					novel, the galleries and palaces of Florence; but a guide-book and a romance
					form an incongruous mixture, and we certainly wish that they should be separated
					in future. </p>
				<p>&quot;<title>The Diary of an Ennuy&#233;e,</title>&quot;is a very well written
					and interesting imposture. Well written and interesting it is true, but still an
					imposture, and that not of a kind which is admissible. The very laws of <hi
						rendition="#italics">cavaliere servente</hi>ism in Italy are not more
					delicate, subtle, and yet strict, than those of fiction, and they are
					transgressed in the volume before us. A fiction must contain no glaring
					improbability, and yet it must never divest itself of a certain idealism, which
					forms its chief beauty. Once in Italy we saw a drama, which was any thing but
					dramatic, and we were reminded of it by the pages of the book before us. The
					hero was an English Milord who had a diseased arm; no medical attendant was able
					to afford him any relief; one doctor, one alone could cure this otherwise mortal
					disorder; but this doctor refused to exert his skill until his friend <hi
						rendition="#italics">Jenkisson</hi>, who was imprisoned in the Tower under
					suspicion of treasonable practices, should be liberated by the sick Milord, who
					was also a secretary of state; but Milord was too patriotic to sacrifice public
					good to his private advantage. Miledi, in the mean time, ran from her husband to
					the doctor, adjuring the one and supplicating the other, while Milord, with his
					bound-up arm, groaning when on the stage, and shrieking while behind it, formed
					a most distressing foreground to the picture. You actually felt for the poor
					man; and a greater verity of scenic illusion (such as it was) was produced by
					that bandaged arm, and the moaning and crippled action of the patient than <ref
						target="people.html#KeanEdmund">Kean</ref> or <ref
						target="people.html#PastaGiuditta">Pasta</ref><pb n="340"/> usually effect
					in their portentous identifications with ideal woe. That our readers may not be
					left in a painful suspense, we proceed to inform them, that when Milord was at
					his last gasp, and the doctor stood unmoved in the midst of his kneeling and
					supplicating relatives, Jenkisson himself, whose innocence had been discovered,
					appeared; a general reconciliation took place; and the doctor was proceeding to
					work a cure, when the curtain fell. </p>
				<p>We do not wish to cast an air of ridicule over the volume before us, which we
					read, really believing in it as we read, with great interest; but having
					discovered that the sensitive, heart- broken, dying, dead diarist is a
					fictitious personage, we are angry at the trick of art that excited our real
					sympathy; and we were led to a conviction that the circumstances that demand our
					deepest interest as a reality, are, when feigned, not of an high order of
					idealism, and consequently the fraud being discovered, the fictitious part of
					the book falls below the usual rate of novel interest.</p>
				<p>But to leave this criticism, or hypercriticism, let us advert to the real merits
					of the work. It is written with great spirit and great enthusiasm: the
					descriptions are vivid, the anecdotes entertaining, and the whole style displays
					intelligence and feeling. The few traits recorded of Italian manners are
					felicitously seized, and the English party is well sketched, from the quiet,
					retiring, suffering, ideal authoress, to the blundering and vivacious
					L&#8212;&#8212;, who may stand as a specimen of a whole tribe of English rovers
					in Italy. We turn over the pages to find an extract, which our limits will not
					permit us to make long. We hesitated between the account of the eruption of
					Vesuvius, the description of the improvisatore Sestini,<hi rendition="#sup"

					have fixed upon as one of the most interesting anecdotes in the book:&#8212;</p>
				<quote><p>Last night we had a numerous party, and Signor P&#8212;&#8212; and his
						daughter came to sing. <hi rendition="#italics">She</hi> is a private singer
						of great talent, and came attended by her lover, or her <hi
							rendition="#italics">fianc&#233;</hi>, who, according to the Italian
						custom, attends his mistress every where during the few weeks which precede
						their marriage. He is a young artist, a favourite pupil of <ref
							target="people.html#Camuccini">Camuccini</ref>, and of very quiet,
						unobstrusive manners. La P. has the misfortune to be plain; her features are
						irregular, her complexion of a sickly paleness, and though her eyes are
						large and dark, they appeared totally devoid of luster and expression. Her
						plainness, the bad taste of her dress, her awkward figure, and her timid and
						embarrassed deportment, all furnished matter of amusement and observation to
						some young people (English of course), whose propensities for <hi
							rendition="#italics">quizzing</hi> exceeded their good breeding and good
						nature. Though La P. does not under-<pb n="341"/> stand a word of either
						French or English, I thought she could not mistake the significant looks and
						whispers of which she was the object, and I was in pain for her and for her
						modest lover. I drew my chair to the piano, and tried to divert her
						attention, by keeping her in conversation, but could get no farther than a
						few questions, which were answered in monosyllables. At length she sang, and
						sang divinely; I found the pale automaton had a soul as well as a voice.
						After giving us with faultless execution, as well as great expression, some
						of <ref target="people.html#Rossini">Rossini</ref>&apos;s finest songs, she
						sang the beautiful and difficult cavatina in <title>Otello</title>,
							&quot;<hi rendition="#italics">Assia al pi&#232; d&apos;un
						salice,</hi>&quot; with the most enchanting style and pathos, and then stood
						as unmoved as a statue, while the company applauded loud and long. A moment
						afterwards, as she stooped to take up a music-book, her lover, who had edged
						himself by degrees from the door to the piano, bent his head too, and
						murmured, in a low voice, but with the most passionate accent, &quot;O
						brava, brava, cara!&quot; She replied only by a look, but it was such a
						look! I never saw a human countenance so entirely, so instantaneously
						changed in character; the vacant eyes kindled and beamed with tenderness:
						the pale cheek glowed, and a bright smile playing round her mouth, just
						parted her lips sufficiently to discover a set of teeth like pearls. I could
						have called her at that moment beautiful; but the change was as transient as
						sudden; it passed like a gleam of light over her face, and vanished; and by
						the time the book was placed on the desk, she looked as plain, as stupid,
						and statue-like as ever. I was the only person who witnessed this little
						bye-scene, and it gave me pleasant thoughts and interest for the rest of the
						evening.&#8212;p. 207.</p>

				<p>We hope to heaven all this is true, and not false as the Ennuy&#233;e herself.
					One thing alone at all atones for her deception. We longed, while reading her
					work, to thank the fair <ref target="people.html#JamesonAnna">authoress</ref>
					for reviving many a half-forgotten Italian scene, and for shedding a beautiful
					light over many a favourite spot; we regretted that our gratitude was due to the
					dead; but since the writer lives, we no longer have this painful debt heavy at
					our hearts, and we pay it with the praise she entirely merits.</p>
				<p>We shall hail with pleasure any new production from the pen of any one of the
					writers of these works; and we were not a little gratified at the announcement
					of <ref target="people.html#PhippsConstantineHenry">Lord Normanby</ref>&apos;s
						&quot;<title>Historiettes.</title>&quot; We hope that in these he has a
					little abated an offensive display of superiority of rank. It is unworthy of the
					enlightened heir of a peerage thus to prize himself above nine-tenths of his
					readers on account of his adventitious advantages, and very absurd to shew it.
					We remember, in former times, that this nobleman had a warm love for talent,
					though its possessor was unendowed either with rank or fashion; we hope the
					generous feeling is not dead. His lordship has too much real talent not to feel
					and appreciate the nobility of nature as well as that of birth, and some
					indication of such a feeling would give a grace to his productions, in which, at
					present, they are deficient. </p>
