				<p rendition="#pnoindent"><hi rendition="#large">T</hi>HERE is no period in the
					history of any country, at all advanced in elegant literature, in which <hi
						rendition="#italics">fictitious adventures</hi> have not made a large part
					of the reading men have most delighted in. They have been grafted upon the
					actions of their heroes, they have been interwoven with their mythology, they
					have been moulded upon the manners of the age, and, in return, have influenced
					not a little the manners of the next generation, by the principles they have
					insinuated, and the sensibilities they have <milestone n="a 4" unit="signature"
						rendition="center"/><pb n="viii"/> exercised. A spirit of adventure, a high
					sense of honour, of martial glory, refined and romantic passion, sentimental
					delicacy, or all the melting sensibilities of humanity, have been, in their
					turns, inspired by this powerful engine, which takes so strong a hold on the
					fancy and the passions of young readers. Adorned with the embellishments of
					poetry, they produce the epic; more concentrated in the story, and exchanging
					narrative for action, they become dramatic; allied with some great moral end,
					didactic, as in the <title>Telemaque</title> of <ref
						target="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</ref>, and the
						<title>Belisaire</title> of <ref target="people.html#Marmontel"
						>Marmontel</ref>. They are often the vehicles of satire, as in the
						<title>Candide</title> and <title>Babouc</title> of <ref
						target="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</ref>, and the <title>Gulliver&apos;s
						Travels</title> of <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>. They
					take a tincture from the learning and politics of the times, and are often made
					use of successfully to attack or to recommend the prevailing systems of the day.
					We have seen liberty and equality recommended from one publication, and French
					principles exposed in <pb n="ix"/> another. When the range of this kind of
					writing is so extensive, and its effect so great, it is evident that it ought to
					hold no mean rank among the productions of genius; and, in truth, there is
					hardly any department of literature in which we shall meet with more fine
					writing than in the best productions of this kind. It is not easy therefore to
					say, why the poet should have so high a place allotted him in the temple of
					Fame, and the romance-writer so low a one, as, in the general estimation, he is
					confined to; for his dignity as a writer has by no means been measured by the
					pleasure he affords to his readers; yet the invention of a story, the choice of
					proper incidents, the ordonnance of the plan, the exhibition of the character,
					the gradual development of a plot, occasional beauties of description, and,
					above all, the power exercised over the reader&apos;s heart, by filling it with
					the successive emotions of love, pity, joy, anguish, transport, or indigna-
						<milestone n="a 5" unit="signature"/><pb n="x"/> tion, together with the
					grave impressive moral resulting from the whole, imply talents of the highest
					order, and ought to command our warmest praise. There is no walk in which taste
					and genius have more distinguished themselves, or in which virtuous and noble
					sentiments have come out with greater lustre, than in the splendid fictions, or
					pathetic tales, with which France, Germany, Switzerland, and our own country,
					have adorned the annals of their literature. A history of romance writing, under
					all its various forms, would be an acceptable present to the public, if given by
					a man of taste and sufficient reading. But there are some periods which make, as
					it were, a new era in this kind of writing, and those productions are more
					particularly deserving our attention which stand at the head of a class, and
					have diverted the taste of the public into some new channel. Of this kind are
					the writings of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>,
					whose name, on the <pb n="xi"/> present occasion, is brought anew before the
					public. He may, in a great measure, be said to be the father of the modern novel
					of the serious or pathetic kind, and he was also an original in the mode of
					epistolary writing by which he carried on the story. </p>
				<p> If we were to search among the treasures of ancient literature for fictions
					similar to the modern novel, we should find none more nearly resembling it than
						<hi rendition="#italics"><title>Theagenes and Chariclea</title></hi>, the
					production of <ref target="people.html#Heliodorus">Heliodorus</ref>, a Christian
					bishop of Trieca, in Thessaly. Though his romance was unexceptionably pure and
					virtuous, he was called upon either to burn his book, or resign his bishopric;
					upon which, with the heroism of an author, he chose the latter. </p>
				<p> But, after Europe had sunk into barbarism, a taste was again to be formed; and a
					taste for the natural, the graceful, and the simple-pathetic, is generally the
					late result of a long course of civilization.</p>

				<p>Every one knows the character of the romances of chivalry&#8212;<title>Amadis de
						Gaul</title> at their head, with whose merits the English reader has lately
					been made acquainted in an elegant abridged version.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">An early-sixteenth century romance by <ref

								Montalvo"</ref> with versions preceeding it by a century or more.
								<ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobert">Robert Southey</ref>&apos;s
							translation into English appeared in 1803. </note></hi> They were
					properly historical, but they heightened the traditionary adventures of the
					heroes of their different countries, with the more wonderful stories of giants,
					enchantments, and other embellishments of the supernatural kind. But we are not
					to suppose that even these fictions were considered, as we now consider them,
					the mere play of the imagination: &quot;<hi rendition="#italics">le vrai seul
						est aimable</hi>&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">&quot;the
							truth alone is beautiful&quot;; <ref target="people.html#Boileau"
								>Boileau</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Epitre
								IX</title></hi> (1674) 43. </note></hi> was always so far a maxim,
					that no work of imagination can greatly succeed, which is not founded upon
					popular belief; but what is <hi rendition="#italics">le vrai</hi>? In those
					times talismans, and wounds cured by sympathetic powder, and charms of all
					kinds, were seriously credited. </p>
				<p> A great deal of love adventure was intermixed in these narratives, but not
					always <pb n="xiii"/> of the purest or most delicate kind. Poetry was often made
					the vehicle of them, particularly in Italy: the <hi rendition="#italics"
							><title>Orlando Furioso</title></hi> of <hi rendition="#italics"><ref
							target="people.html#Ariosto">Ariosto</ref></hi>, is a chivalrous romance
					in verse.</p>
				<p> As, however, the spirit of military adventure subsided, these softened, by
					degrees, into the languishing love romances of the French school&#8212;the
						<title>Clelia</title>s and <title>Cassandra</title>s, the laboured
					productions of the <ref target="people.html#LaCalprenede">Calprenedes</ref> and
						<ref target="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Scuderis</ref>. I might indeed
					have mentioned before these a romance of a peculiar kind, the
						<title>Astrea</title> of <ref target="people.html#UrfeHonored"
						>d&apos;Urf&#233;</ref>, which all France read with eagerness at the time it
					was published. It is a pastoral romance, and its celebrity was, in a great
					measure, owing to its being strongly seasoned with allusions to the amours of
					the court of <ref target="people.html#HenryIVKingofFrance">Henry the
						Fourth</ref>. </p>
				<p> But to return to the Romances <hi rendition="#italics">de longue
						haleine</hi>.<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Literally, the

					unshaken by time or accident, and a species of love so exalted and refined, that
					it <pb n="xiv"/> bore but little resemblance to a natural passion. In the story,
					however, they were a step nearer to nature; the adventures were marvellous, but
					not impossible. Their personages were all removed from common life, and taken
					from ancient history; but without the least resemblance to the heroes whose
					names they bore. The manners therefore, and the passions, referred to an ideal
					world, the creation of the writer; but the situations were often striking, and
					the sentiments always noble. They would have reigned longer, had they been less
					tedious&#8212;there exists no appeal for an author who makes his readers weary.
						<ref target="people.html#Boileau">Boilieu</ref> ridiculed these, as <ref

					their knell was rung: people were ready to wonder they had ever admired them. </p>
				<p> A closer imitation of nature began now to be called for: not but that, from the
					earliest times, there had been tales and stories imitating real life; a few
					serious, <pb n="xv"/> but generally comic. The <hi rendition="#italics"

						>Queen of Navarre</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics">contes</hi> and <hi
						rendition="#italics">fabliaux</hi> without number, may be considered as
					novels, though of a lighter texture; they abounded with adventure, generally of
					the humourous, often of the licentious kind, and, indeed, were mostly founded on
					intrigue, but the nobler passions were seldom touched. The <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>Roman Comique</title></hi> of <ref
						target="people.html#Scarron">Scarron</ref> is a regular piece of its kind,
					and possesses great merit in the humourous way; but the <hi rendition="#italics"

					&quot;The first romances in which were seen natural incidents, and the manners
					of good company, described with elegance. Before her time, improbable adventures
					were described in a turgid and affected stile.&quot; The novels of <ref
						target="people.html#LaFayetteMadame">Madame la Fayette</ref> are certainly
					beautiful, but a step is still wanting; they no longer speak, indeed, of <ref
						target="people.html#AlexandertheGreat">Alexander</ref>s and <ref
						target="people.html#BrutusMarcus">Brutus</ref>&apos;s, still less of giants
					and fairies; but the heroes and heroines are princes and princesses&#8212;they
					are not people of our acquaintance. The scene is, perhaps, in Spain, or amongst
					the Moors; it does not reflect the picture of domestic life, they are not the
					men and women we see about us every day.</p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#LeSageAlain">Le Sage</ref>, in his <title>Gil
						Blas</title>, a work of infinite entertainment, though of dubious morality,
					presented us such people; but his portraits were mostly of the humourous kind,
					and his work was rather a series of separate adventures than a chain of events
						<pb n="xvii"/> concurring, in one plan, to the production of the
					catastrophe. There was still wanting a mode of writing which should connect the
					high passion, and delicacy of sentiment of the old romance, with characters
					moving in the same sphere of life with ourselves, and brought into action by
					incidents of daily occurrence. </p>
				<p> In the earlier periods of English history, we had our share in the rude
					literature of the times, and we were familiar, either by translations or stories
					of our own growth, with the heroes of the chivalrous times, many of whom
					belonged to our own country. We had also, in common with our neighbours, the
					monkish legends, a species of romance abounding with the marvellous, and
					particularly suited to the taste of a superstitious age. Many of these merit
					attention as a branch, and no small one, of fiction; they have been properly
					exploded for their falsehood; they should now be preserved for their invention:
					they <pb n="xviii"/> are now harmless; they can no longer excite our
					indignation, let them be permitted to amuse our fancy. </p>
				<p> In the reign of <ref target="people.html#ElizabethIQueenofEngland">Queen
						Elizabeth</ref>, we had the once famous romance <hi rendition="#italics"
							><ref target="people.html#SidneyPhilip">Sidney</ref>&apos;s
							<title>Arcadia</title></hi>, of the pastoral heroic kind, if the
					expression may be permitted. It is a book that all have heard of, that some few
					possess, but that nobody reads. </p>
				<p> From that period, to the middle of the last reign, we had tales and stories of
					various kinds, but scarcely one that continues to be read to the present day,
					and, I believe, not any (the singularly ingenious allegorical fiction of the
						<title>Pilgrim&apos;s Progress</title><hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">By <ref target="people.html#BunyanJohn">John
							Bunyan</ref>.</note></hi> excepted) that was known out of our own
					country. We had poets, we had philosophers, long before we had attained any
					excellence in the lighter kinds of prose composition. <ref
						target="people.html#HarringtonJames">Harrington</ref>&apos;s

						</lg></quote>It was, like <title>Astrea</title>, filled with fashionable

					characters; some adventure and a love story, were all they aimed at. <hi

					either there, or, I believe, in any other part of the work, the name of one
					English novel, the <title>Atalantis</title> excepted. <hi rendition="#italics"
						>Plays</hi> are often mentioned as a favourite and dangerous part of
					ladies&apos; reading. The <pb n="xx"/> first author we had, who distinguished
					himself by natural painting, was that truly original genius <ref
						target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref>; and if from any one <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> caught, in some
					measure, his peculiar manner of writing, to him it must be traced, whose
						<title>Robinson Crusoe</title> and <title>Family Instructor</title> (the
					latter consisting of domestic dialogues,) he must have read in his youth. They
					were both accurate describers, minute and circumstantial, but with this
					difference, that the minuteness of <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De
						Foe</ref> was more employed about things, and that of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> about persons and
					sentiments. No one ever knew like <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De
						Foe</ref> to give to fiction, by an accumulation of circumstance, and a
					grave natural way of telling the story, the most serious air of truth; except,
					indeed, <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, in his
						<title>Gulliver&apos;s Travels</title>. <ref
						target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> wrote also some novels; I
					cannot speak of them, for I have not seen them: they do not appear to have
					attained much celebrity. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> was the man who was to introduce a new kind <pb n="xxi"
					/>of moral painting; he drew equally from nature and from his own ideas. From
					the world about him he took the incidents, manners, and general character, of
					the times in which he lived, and from his own beautiful ideas he copied that
					sublime of virtue which charms us in his <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, and that sublime of
					passion which interests us in his <ref target="people.html#Clementina"
						>Clementina</ref>. That kind of fictitious writing of which he has set the
					example, disclaims all assistance from giants or genii. The moated castle is
					changed to a modern parlour; the princess and her pages to a lady and her
					domestics, or even to a simple maiden, without birth or fortune; we are not
					called on to wonder at improbable events, but to be moved by natural passions,
					and impressed by salutary maxims. The pathos of the story, and the dignity of
					the sentiments, interest and charm us; simplicity is warned, vice rebuked, and,
					from the perusal of a novel, we rise better prepared to meet the ills of <pb
						n="xxii"/> life with firmness, and to perform our respective parts on the
					great theatre of life. It was the high and just praise given by our great
					critic, <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>, to the author
					of <title>Clarissa</title>, that &quot;he had enlarged the knowledge of human
					nature, and taught the passions to move at the command of virtue.&quot;<hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><hi rendition="#italics"
									><title>Rambler</title></hi> 97 (Tuesday, February 19,
							1751)</note></hi> The novelist has, indeed, all the advantage of the
					preacher in introducing useful maxims and sentiments of virtue; an advantage
					which <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> made large use
					of, and he has besides the power of impressing them upon the heart through the
					best sensibilities of our nature. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> prided himself on being a moral and religious writer; and,
					as <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> did before him, he
					professed to take under his particular protection that sex which is supposed to
					be most open to good or evil impressions; whose inexperience most requires
					cautionary precepts, and whose sensibilities it is most important to secure
					against a wrong direction. The <pb n="xxiii"/> manner of this captivating writer
					was also new. </p>
				<p> There are three modes of carrying on a story: the narrative or epic as it may be
					called; in this the author relates himself the whole adventure; this is the
					manner of <ref target="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</ref> in his <title>Don
						Quixote</title>, and of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry"
						>Fielding</ref> in his <title>Tom Jones</title>. It is the most common way.
					The author, like the muse, is supposed to know every thing; he can reveal the
					secret springs of actions, and let us into events in his own time and manner. He
					can be concise, or diffuse, according as the different parts of his story
					require it. He can indulge, as <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry"
						>Fielding</ref> has done, in digressions, and thus deliver sentiments and
					display knowledge which would not properly belong to any of the characters. But
					his narration will not be lively, except he frequently drops himself, and runs
					into dialogue: all good writers therefore have thrown as much as possible of the
					dramatic into their narrative. <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Mad.</ref>
					<pb n="xxiv"/>
					<ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">d&apos;Arblay</ref> has done this so
					successfully, that we have as clear an idea, not only of the sentiments, but the
					manner of expression of her different personages, as if we took it from the
					scenes in a play. </p>
				<p> Another mode is that of memoirs; where the subject of the adventures relates his
					own story. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>, in his
						<title>Roderic Random</title>, and <ref target="people.html#GoldsmithOliver"
						>Goldsmith</ref>, in his <title>Vicar of Wakefield</title>, have adopted
					this mode; it confines the author&apos;s stile, which should be suited, though
					it is not always, to the supposed talents and capacity of the imaginary
					narrator. It has the advantage of the warmth and interest a person may be
					supposed to feel in his own affairs; and he can more gracefully dwell upon
					minute circumstances which have affected him. It has a greater air of truth, as
					it seems to account for the communication to the public. The author, it is true,
					knows every thing, but when the secret recesses of the heart are to be laid
					open, we can hear no <pb n="xxv"/> one with so much pleasure as the person
					himself. <ref target="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</ref>, whose productions
					partly followed, and partly were cotemporary [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>]
					with those of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, has
					put the history of Marianne into her own mouth, and we are amused to hear her
					dwell on little touches which are almost too trivial to be noticed by any body
					but herself. </p>
				<p> But what the hero cannot say, the author cannot tell, nor can it be rendered
					probable, that a very circumstantial narrative should be given by a person,
					perhaps at the close of a long life, of conversations that have happened at the
					beginning of it. The author has all along two characters to support, for he has
					to consider how his hero felt at the time the events to be related, and how it
					is natural he should feel them at the time he is relating them; at a period,
					perhaps, when curiosity is extinguished, passion cooled, and when, at any rate,
					the suspense which rendered them interesting <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"
							><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. i.</hi></fw><milestone unit="signature"
						n="b" rendition="#center"/><pb n="xxvi"/> is over. This seems, therefore,
					the least perfect mode of any.</p>
				<p> A third way remains, that of <hi rendition="#italics">epistolary
						correspondence</hi>, carried on between the characters of the novel. This is
					the form made use of by <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> and many others after, none, I believe, before him. He
					seems to have been led to it by circumstances in his early youth, which will be
					hereafter related. This method unites, in a good measure, the advantages of the
					other two; it gives the feelings of the moment as the writers felt them <hi
						rendition="#italics">at</hi> the moment. It allows a pleasing variety of
					stile, if the author has sufficient command of pen to assume it. It makes the
					whole work dramatic, since all the characters speak in their own persons. It
					accounts for breaks in the story, by the omission or loss of letters. It is
					incompatible with a rapid stile, but gives room for the graceful introduction of
					remark and sentiment, or any kind, almost, of digressive matter. But, on the
					other <pb n="xxvii"/> hand, it is highly fictitious; it is the most natural and
					the least probable way of telling a story. That letters should be written at all
					times, and upon every occasion in life, that those letters should be preserved,
					and altogether form a connected story, it requires much art to render specious.
					It introduces the inconvenience so much felt in dramatic writing, for want of a
					narrator; the necessity of having an insipid confidant to tell the circumstances
					so that an author cannot relate in any other way. It obliges a man to tell of
					himself, what perhaps no man would tell; and sometimes to repeat compliments
					which modesty would lead him to suppress: and when a long conversation is
					repeated, supposes a memory more exact than is generally found. Artificial as it
					therefore is, still as it enables an author to assume, in a lively manner, the
					hopes and fears, and passions, and to imitate the peculiar way of thinking of
					his characters, it became fashionable, and has <milestone n="b 2"
						unit="signature"/><pb n="xxviii"/> been adopted by many both at home and
					abroad, especially by the French writers; their language, perhaps, being
					particularly suited to the epistolary stile, and <ref
						target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref> himself, in his
						<title>Nouvelle Heloise</title>, has followed the steps of our countryman. </p>
				<p> Our author had a most ready pen, indeed it was seldom out of his hand, and this
					readiness, with the early habit of writing letters, made him take pleasure in an
					extensive correspondence, with which he filled the interstices of a busy day.
					Before this correspondence is presented to the reader, it may not be undesirable
					to preface the collection with all the particulars which can now be collected,
					relative to him who was the centre of it. The facts are taken either from the
					letters themselves, or the obliging communications of some of his surviving
					cotemporaries, [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>] or from printed biographical
					anecdotes. </p>
				<p>
					<hi rendition="#italics"><ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Samuel
							Richardson</ref></hi>, whose name and genius no English readers, and it
					may be <pb n="xxix"/> added, few foreign ones, are unacquainted with, is one
					instance, among innumerable others, of natural talents making their way to
					eminence, under the pressure of narrow circumstances, the disadvantage of
					obscure birth, and the want of a liberal education. </p>
				<p> The following is the account he gives of his family, in a letter to <ref
						target="people.html#StinstraJohannes">Mr. Stinstra</ref>. <quote><p
							rendition="#pnoindent">My father was a very honest man, descended of a
							family of middling note, in the county of Surry, but which having for
							several generations a large number of children, the not large
							possessions were split and divided, so that he and his brothers were put
							to trades; and the sisters were married to tradesmen. My mother was also
							a good woman, of a family not ungenteel; but whose father and mother
							died in her infancy, within half-an-hour of each other, in the London
							pestilence of 1665.</p>
						<p>My father&apos;s business was that of a joiner, then more distinct from
							that of a carpenter than now it is with us. He was <milestone n="b 3"
								unit="signature"/><pb n="xxx"/> a good draughtsman, and understood
							architecture. His skill and ingenuity, and an understanding superior to
							his business, with his remarkable integrity of heart and manners, made
							him personally beloved by several persons of rank, among whom were the
								<ref target="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">Duke of Monmouth</ref>
							and the <ref target="people.html#ShaftesburyAnthonyAshleyCooper">first
								Earl of Shaftsbury</ref>, both so noted in our English history;
							their known favour for him having, on the Duke&apos;s attempt on the
							crown, subjected him to be looked upon with a jealous eye,
							notwithstanding he was noted for a quiet and inoffensive man, he thought
							proper, on the decollation of the first-named unhappy nobleman, to quit
							his London business, and to retire to Derbyshire, though to his great
							detriment; and there I, and three other children out of nine, were born.
						</p></quote></p>
				<p> As it was probably a great disadvantage to <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>&apos;s father to
					leave his flourishing business in London, and as it is <pb n="xxxi"/> not very
					likely that a man in his way of life should have so companionable an intimacy
					with the <ref target="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">Duke of Monmouth</ref> and
					the <ref target="people.html#ShaftesburyAnthonyAshleyCooper">Earl of
						Shaftsbury</ref>, as to subject him to danger on that account merely; it is
					probable that he entered further into their political views, than appears from
					the foregoing account.<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">That is, he
							probably sympathized with the anti-royalist sentiments of the Monmouth
							Rebellion of 1685, which attempted to overthrow <ref
								target="people.html#JamesIIKingofEngland">James
						II</ref>.</note></hi>
					<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Samuel Richardson</ref> was born
					in the year 1689, in Derbyshire, but in what particular place cannot be traced
					out. It is said that <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
					>Richardson</ref>, from some motives known only to himself, always avoided
					mentioning the town which gave him birth. If this concealment arose from a
					reluctance to bring into view the obscurity and narrow circumstances in which
					his childhood was involved, the motive was an unworthy one, since they only
					served to reflect honour on the genius which could break through so thick a
					cloud. But, in truth, the candour and openness with which he relates the
					circumstances of his early life, ought to clear him from this imputa-<milestone
						n="b 4" unit="signature"/>
					<pb n="xxxii"/> tion. He goes on to inform his friend, that his father intended
					him for the church, a designation perfectly agreeable to his own inclinations,
					and which indeed his strong sense of religion, and the sobriety of his conduct,
					gave him an appropriate fitness for. But he adds: &quot;But while I was very
					young, some heavy losses having disabled him from supporting me as genteely as
					he wished in an education proper for the function, he left me to choose, at the
					age of fifteen or sixteen, a business; having been able to give me only common
					school-learning.&quot; </p>
				<p> Some of the admirers of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> have wished to raise his character by asserting, that he
					possessed a knowledge of the classics; but his own assertions are frequent in
					his letters, that he possessed no language but his own, not even French. It is
					said, indeed, that <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref> and he
					have been heard to quote <ref target="people.html#Horace">Horace</ref> and other
					classics in their familiar conversations, and <pb n="xxxiii"/> the letters of
					the pedant Brand in <title>Clarissa</title>, which are larded with Latin
					quotations, are adduced as proofs of his scholarship; but, with regard to the
					latter, it seems probable, as may be seen in the letters, that he was assisted
					by his friend <ref target="people.html#ChanningJohannis">Mr. Channing</ref>;
					and, as to the former, it is not unlikely that he might be familiar with a few
					of those Latin phrases which are used, in a manner proverbially, by scholars, as
					the garniture of their discourse; and that he might also remember something of
					the rudiments, which he probably learnt at school, neither of which
					circumstances imply any real knowledge of the language. His deficiencies in this
					respect he often lamented; and it is certain his style is as far as possible
					from that of a scholar. It abounds with colloquial vulgarisms, and has neither
					that precision, nor that tincture of classic elegance, which is generally the
					result of an early familiarity with the best models. </p>
				<p> But, however an ignorance of the learned <milestone n="b 5" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="xxxiv"/> languages might, some centuries ago, have precluded the
					unlearned Englishman from those treasures of literature which open the faculties
					and enlarge the understanding, our own tongue now contains productions of every
					kind sufficient to kindle the flame of genius in a congenial mind. Reading,
					provided a man seeks rather after good books than new books, still continues to
					be the cheapest of all amusements; and the boy who has barely learned to read at
					a village school-dame&apos;s, is in possession of a key which will unlock the
					treasures of <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespeare</ref> and
					of <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref>, of <ref
						target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> and of <ref
						target="people.html#LockeJohn">Locke</ref>. Nor is time generally wanting;
					the severest labour has its intervals, in which the youth, who is stung with the
					thirst of knowledge, will steal to the page that gratifies his curiosity, and
					afterwards brood over the thoughts which have been there kindled, while he is
					plying the awl, planing the board, or hanging over the loom. To have this desire
					implanted in the <pb n="xxxv"/> young mind, does, indeed, require some
					peculiarly favourable circumstances. These can sometimes be traced, oftener not.
					In regular education, the various stimuli that produce this effect are subject
					to our observation, and distinctly marked; in like manner as we know the nature
					and quality of the seed we sow in gardens and cultured ground; but of those
					geniuses called self-taught, we usually know no more than we do of the wild
					flowers that spring up in the fields. We know very well they had a seed, but we
					are ignorant by what accidental circumstances the seed of one has been conveyed
					by the winds to some favourable spot, where it has been safely lodged in the
					bosom of the ground, nor why it germinates there, and springs up in health and
					vigour, while a thousand others perish. Some observation struck the young sense;
					some verse, repeated in his hearing, dropt its sweetness on the unfolding ear;
					some nursery story, told with impressive <milestone n="b 6" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="xxxvi"/> tones and gestures, has laid hold on the kindling
					imagination, and thus have been formed, in solitude and obscurity, the genius of
					a <ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</ref> or a <ref
						target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespeare</ref>. </p>
				<p> With regard to <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, it
					is not often we possess such particular information as he has given us, in his
					own words, of his early invention, and powers of affecting the
					heart.&#8212;</p><quote><p rendition="#pnoindent">I recollect, that I was early noted for having
						invention. I was not fond of play, as other boys: my school-fellows used to

				<p> It is in like manner related of the Abb&#233; Prev&#244;st, one of the most
					affecting of the French novelists, that, when he was among the Carthusians, into
					which order he had originally entered, he was accustomed to amuse the good
					fathers with telling them stories of his invention; and once, it is recorded,
					they sat up the whole night listening to him. But not only our author&apos;s
					inventive turn, the particular mode in which he exercised it was very early
					determined. He was fond of two things, which boys have generally an aversion
					to&#8212;letter-writing, and the company of the other sex. An incident, which he
					relates in the following words, shews how early he had devoted himself to be the
					Mentor of his female acquaintance: <pb n="xxxviii"/>
					<quote><p>From my earliest youth, I had a love of letter-writing: I was not
							eleven years old when I wrote, spontaneously, a letter to a widow of
							near fifty, who, pretending to a zeal for religion, and being a constant
							frequenter of church ordinances, was continually fomenting quarrels and
							disturbances, by backbiting and scandal, among all her acquaintance. I
							collected from the scripture texts that made against her. Assuming the
							style and address of a person in years, I exhorted her, I expostulated
							with her. But my hand-writing was known. I was challenged with it, and
							owned the boldness; for she complained of it to my mother with tears. My
							mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her
							years; but knowing that her son was not of a pert or forward nature,
							but, on the contrary, shy and bashful, she commended my principles,
							though she censured the liberty taken. </p></quote></p>
				<pb n="xxxix"/>
				<p>Notwithstanding the ill-will which this freedom might draw upon him from
					individuals, he was, he tells us, a general favourite with young and old. </p>
				<quote>
					<p> As a bashful and not forward boy, I was an early favourite with all the
						young women of taste and reading in the neighbourhood. Half a dozen of them,
						when met to work with their needles, used, when they got a book they liked,
						and thought I should, to borrow me to read to them; their mothers sometimes
						with them; and both mothers and daughters used to be pleased with the
						observations they put me upon making. </p>
					<p> I was not more than thirteen, when three of these young women, unknown to
						each other, having an high opinion of my taciturnity, revealed to me their
						love-secrets, in order to induce me to give them copies to write after, or
						correct, for answers to their lover&apos;s <pb n="xl"/> letters: nor did any
						one of them ever know that I was the secretary to the others. I have been
						directed to chide, and even repulse, when an offence was either taken or
						given, at the very time that the heart of the chider or repulser was open
						before me, overflowing with esteem and affection; and the fair repulser,
						dreading to be taken at her word, directing <hi rendition="#italics"
							>this</hi> word, or <hi rendition="#italics">that</hi> expression, to be
						softened or changed. One highly gratified with her lover&apos;s fervour, and
						vows of everlasting love, has said, when I have asked her direction; I
						cannot tell you what to write; but, (her heart on her lips) you cannot write
						too kindly; all her fear was only, that she should incur slight for her
						kindness. </p>

				<p> Human nature is human nature in every class; the hopes and the fears, the
					perplexities and the struggles, of these lowbred girls in, probably, an obscure
					village, supplied the future author with those ideas, <pb n="xli"/> which, by
					their gradual development, produced the characters of a <ref

					courted his society, than in reading to these girls in, it may be, a little
					back-shop, or a mantua-maker&apos;s parlour, with a brick-floor. In the mean
					time, years went on, and the father of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, being disappointed
					in his views of bringing him up to a profession, it became incumbent on him to
					chuse a humbler employment, and he fixed upon that of a printer; chiefly, as he
					informs us, because he thought it would gratify his thirst for reading. He was
					bound apprentice to <hi rendition="#italics"><ref target="people.html#WildeJohn"
							>Mr. John Wilde</ref>, of Stationer&apos;s-hall</hi>, in the year 1706.
					He did not, however, find it easy to gratify this thirst, though the stream ran
					by his lips, &quot;I served,&quot; (says he) <quote><p rendition="#pnoindent">a diligent seven years to
						it; to a <pb n="xlii"/> master who grudged every hour to me that tended not
						to his profit, even of those times of leisure and diversion, which the
						refractoriness of my fellow-servants <hi rendition="#italics">obliged</hi>
						him to allow them, and were usually allowed by other masters to their
						apprentices. I stole from the hours of rest and relaxation, my reading times
						for improvement of my mind; and, being engaged in a correspondence with a
						gentleman, greatly my superior in degree, and of ample fortune, who, had he
						lived, intended high things for me; those were all the opportunities I had
						in my apprenticeship to carry it on. But this little incident I may mention;
						I took care that even my candle was of my own purchasing, that I might not,
						in the most trifling instance, make my master a sufferer (and who used to
						call me the pillar of his house) and not to disable myself by watching or
						sitting-up, to perform my duty to him in the <pb n="xliii"/> day-time.
					</p></quote>The correspondence with the gentleman just mentioned, must have been of
					great service to the young apprentice, in gaining that fluency of pen which he
					was remarkable for, though it appears he was deprived by death of the patronage
					he expected. <quote><p rendition="#pnoindent">Multitudes of letters passed between this gentleman and me;

						travelled. I could from them, had I been at liberty, and had I at that time
						thought of writing as I have since done, have drawn great helps: but many
						years ago, all the letters that passed between us, by a particular desire of
						his (lest they should ever be published) were committed to the flames.

				<p> After the expiration of his appren- <pb n="xliv"/> ticeship, our author
					continued five or six years working as a compositor and corrector of the press
					to a printing-office, and part of the time as an overseer; and, at length thus
					working his way upwards into day-light, he took up his freedom, and set up for
					himself; at first in a court in Fleet-street, from whence, as his business grew
					more extensive, he removed into Salisbury-court. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was not one of those
					who make genius an excuse for idleness. He had been diligent and conscientious
					as an apprentice, he was assiduous and liberal as a master. Besides the proper
					work of a printer, he did a good deal of business for the booksellers, in
					writing for them indexes, prefaces, and, as he stiles them, honest dedications.
					These humble employments tended to facilitate to him the use and management of
					the pen. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>&apos;s
					punctuality, and the honour and generosity of his dealings, soon gained <pb
						n="xlv"/> him friends, and his business greatly flourished. He printed, for
					a while, the <title>True Briton</title>, a periodical paper, published in 1723,
					under the auspices of the <ref target="people.html#WhartonPhilip">Duke of
						Wharton</ref>, who, at that time, was endeavouring to foment a spirit of
					opposition in the City; and, to gain popularity, became a member of the
					Wax-chandler&apos;s Company. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref>, though his principles were very different, was intimate
					with him, as was also, in early life, <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr.
						Young</ref>. Some of the numbers of the <title>True Briton</title> were
					prosecuted, but <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. R.</ref> escaped,
					as his name did not appear. He was engaged some time in printing a newspaper,
					called <hi rendition="#italics"><title>The Daily Journal</title></hi>, and
					afterwards, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>The Daily Gazetteer</title></hi>.
					Through the interest of the Speaker, <ref target="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr.
						Onslow</ref>, he had the printing of the <title>Journals of the House of
						Commons</title>, in twenty-six volumes, folio. <ref
						target="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr. Onslow</ref> had a great regard for
					him, and often received him at his house in Ember-court. Polite regards are
					sometimes more <pb n="xlvi"/> easily obtained than money from the court end of
					the town. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. R.</ref> did not find
					this branch of his business the one which yielded him the quickest returns. He
					thus writes to his friend <ref target="people.html#HillAaron">Aaron Hill</ref>:
					&quot;As to my silence, I have been at one time exceedingly busy in getting
					ready some volumes of Journals, to entitle myself to a payment which yet I never
					had, no, not to the value of a shilling, though the debt is upwards of three
					thousand pounds, and though I have pressed for it, and been excessively pressed
					for the want of it.&quot; </p>
				<p> He was chosen master of his company, an office, which, in the Stationer&apos;s
					Company, is not only honourable but lucrative, in 1754; on which occasion one of
					his friends tells him, that though he did not doubt his going very well through
					every other part of the duty, he feared his habitual abstemiousness would allow
					him to make but a very poor figure at the city <pb n="xlvii"/> feasts. His
					indulgencies were not of the sensual kind&#8212;he had, according to the
					salutary custom of the London citizens, a country residence; first at North-end,
					near Hammersmith, and afterwards at Parsons&apos;s-green, where he spent the
					time he could spare from business, and seldom without visitors. He loved to
					encourage diligence and early rising amongst his journeymen, and often hid a
					half-crown amongst the letters, so that the first who came to work in a morning
					might find it. At other times he brought, for the same purpose, fruit from his
					garden. </p>

				<quote>
					<p> Ah! Madam; and do you thus call upon me! Forgive an interrupting sigh, and
						allow me a short abruption. </p>
					<p> I told you, Madam, that I have been married twice; both times happily: you
						will guess so, as to my first, when I tell you that I cherish the memory of
						my lost wife to this hour: and as to the second, when I assure you that I
						can do so without derogating from the merits of, or being disallowed by my
						present; who speaks of her on all occasions, as respectfully and
						affectionately as I do myself. </p>
					<p> By my first wife I had five sons and one daughter; some of them living, to
						be delightful prattlers, with all the appearances of sound health, lively in
						their features, and promising as to their minds; and the death of one of
						them, I <pb n="xlix"/> doubt, accelerating from grief, that of the otherwise
						laudably afflicted, mother. I have had, by my present wife, five girls and
						one boy; I have buried of these the promising boy, and one girl: four girls
						I have living, all at present very good; their mother a true and instructing
						mother to them. </p>
					<p> Thus have I lost six sons (all my sons) and two daughters, every one of
						which, to answer your question, I parted with with the utmost regret. Other
						heavy deprivations of friends, very near, and very dear, have I also
						suffered. I am very susceptible, I will venture to say, of impressions of
						this nature. A father, an honest, a worthy father, I lost by the accident of
						a broken thigh, snapped by a sudden jirk, endeavouring to recover a slip
						passing through his own yard. My father, whom I attended in every stage of
						his last illness, I long mourned for. Two brothers, very dear to me, I <fw

							i.</hi></fw><milestone n="c" unit="signature"/><pb n="l"/> lost abroad.
						A friend, more valuable than most brothers, was taken from me. No less than
						eleven affecting deaths in two years! My nerves were so affected with these
						repeated blows, that I have been forced, after trying the whole <hi
							rendition="#italics">materia medica</hi>, and consulting many
						physicians, as the only palliative (not a remedy to be expected) to go into
						a regimen; and, for seven years past have I forborne wine and flesh and
						fish; and, at this time, I and all my family are in mourning for a good
						sister, with whom neither I would have parted, could I have had my choice.
						From these affecting dispensations, will you not allow me, Madam, to remind
						an unthinking world, immersed in pleasures, what a life this is that they
						are so fond of, and to arm them against the affecting changes of it?</p>
				</quote>
				<p> Severely tried as he was, he had yet great comfort in his family; his daughters
						<pb n="li"/> grew up under his tuition, amiable and worthy; they were
					carefully educated, and engaged his fondest affections. It is remarkable that
					his daughter <ref target="people.html#RichardsonAnne">Anne</ref>, whose early
					ill-health had often excited his apprehensions, was the last survivor of the
					family. They were all much employed in writing for him, and transcribing his
					letters; but, his chief amanuensis was his daughter <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonMarthadaughter">Martha</ref>. </p>
				<p> In addition to his other business, <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Mr. Richardson</ref> purchased, in 1760, a moiety of the patent of law
					printer to his majesty, which department of his business he carried on in
					partnership with Miss <ref target="people.html#LintotCatherine">Catherine
						Lintot</ref>. From all these sources he was enabled to make that comfortable
					provision for a rising family, which patient industry, judiciously directed,
					will, generally, in this country, enable a man to procure. </p>
				<p> But the genius of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
					was not destined to be for ever employed in ushering into the world the
					productions of others. <milestone n="c 2" unit="signature"/><pb n="lii"/>
					Neither city feasts and honours, nor printing law books and acts of parliament,
					nor the cares of a family, and the management of so large a concern of business,
					could quench the spark that glowed within him, or hinder the lovely ideas that
					played about his fancy, from being cloathed in words, and produced to captivate
					the public ear. The printer in Salisbury-court was to create a new species of
					writing; his name was to be familiar in the mouths of the great, the witty, and
					the gay, and he was destined to give one motive more to the rest of Europe, to
					learn the language of his country. The early fondness of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> for epistolary
					writing has already been mentioned, as also that he employed his pen
					occasionally for the booksellers. They desired him to give them a volume of
					Familiar Letters, upon a variety of supposed occasions. He began, but, letter
					producing letter, like <ref target="people.html#BunyanJohn">John Bunyan</ref>,
					&quot;as he pulled, it came;&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><ref

							for His Book.&quot; </note></hi> till, unexpected to himself, the result
					was <pb n="liii"/> his <hi rendition="#italics"><title>History of
						Pamela</title></hi>. His account of it is as follows:&#8212; <quote><p
							rendition="#pnoindent">The writing it, then, was owing to the following
							occasion:&#8212;Two booksellers, my particular friends, entreated me to
							write for them a little volume of Letters, in a common style, on such
							subjects as might be of use to those country readers, who were unable to
							indite for themselves. Will it be any harm, said I, in a piece you want
							to be written so low, if we should instruct them how they should think
							and act in common cases, as well as indite? They were the more urgent
							with me to begin the little volume for this hint. I set about it; and,
							in the progress of it, writing two or three letters to instruct handsome
							girls, who were obliged to go out to service, as we phrase it, how to
							avoid the snares that might be laid against their virtue; the above
							story recurred to my thought: And hence sprung <title>Pamela</title>.
							This volume of letters <milestone n="c 3" unit="signature"/><pb n="liv"
							/> is not worthy of your perusal. I laid aside several letters after I
							had written them for this volume, as too high for the view of my two
							friends.</p></quote></p>
				<p> This was written, (it was then only in two volumes) in three months. The idea he
					set out with of writing letters for rather the lower class, probably determined
					him to the station of his heroine, and the simplicity of her language. </p>
				<p> The author&apos;s object in <title>Pamela</title> is twofold: to reclaim a
					libertine by the influence of virtuous affection, and to conduct virtue safe and
					triumphant through the severest trials, to an honourable reward. For this
					purpose <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>, a young girl, born
					of poor, but pious and worthy parents, taken by a lady of fashion to wait upon
					her person, and brought up by her with great tenderness and attention to her
					improvement, is, after the lady&apos;s death, at which event the story opens,
					exposed to the solicitations of her youthful master, the only <pb n="lv"/> son
					of her benefactress. The story is carried on by letters, chiefly between <ref
						target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> and her father and mother.
					Her youth and innocence render her, for some time, unsuspecting of the passion
					she has inspired; and, when she can no longer misunderstand the purposes of her
					master, she prepares to leave his house, but he detains her under various
					pretences, and attempts liberties with her person, which she resists with
					firmness, as well as his pecuniary offers; though not disinclined to his person,
					and though she has no resource, on the supposition of leaving him, but to return
					to hard country labour. Her behaviour is all the while full of humility and
					respect to her master, in every instance consistent with the defence of her
					honour. Her master, who, though young, is a practised libertine, finding her
					protected by the watchful advice of her parents, and by the care of a virtuous
					house-keeper, who had belonged to his mother, determines to con- <milestone
						n="c 4" unit="signature"/><pb n="lvi"/> vey her to a place where she shall
					be entirely in his power. Under pretence, therefore, of sending her home to her
					parents, he has her conveyed to another of his seats, where she is absolutely
					confined, under the guardianship of an abandoned woman, whose office it has been
					to minister to his pleasures. The poor <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews"
						>Pamela</ref> forms many schemes to get away, and endeavours, by means of a
					young clergyman, to engage some of the families of the neighbourhood in her
					favour, but without effect. She then endeavours to escape alone, and actually
					gets through a barred window into the garden, from whence she hopes to escape
					into the fields, though ignorant of any one who will receive her; but she falls,
					and bruises herself in attempting to get over the high brick wall. Her
					sufferings in this attempt are affectingly described. Finding all her schemes
					abortive, she is greatly tempted to free herself from the danger of dishonour,
					by throwing herself <pb n="lvii"/> into the pond, but considerations of piety at
					length prevail, and she determines to trust to Providence. Her master at length,
					after many ineffectual attempts to vanquish her resistance, begins to relent,
					professes honourable love to her; and, after a severe struggle between his
					passion and his pride of birth and fortune, offers her his hand in marriage.
						<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> acknowledges her love
					for him, and accepts (almost upon her knees it must be allowed) his proposal.
					Difficulties remain to be got over with <ref target="people.html#DaversLady"
						>Lady Davers</ref>, a proud and termagant woman of quality, sister to <ref
						target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref> but the sweetness and prudence of <ref
						target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> overcome her dislike, and
					the whole concludes with the perfect happiness of the wedded pair. </p>
				<p> Such is the outline of this first work of our author, which was published in
					1740. It was received with a burst of applause from all ranks of people. The
					novelty of the plan, the strokes of nature and pathos with which the work
					abounds, the simpli- <milestone n="c 5" unit="signature"/><pb n="lviii"/> city
					of the language, the sentiments of piety and virtue that are brought forward,
					took at once the taste of the public. Numberless were the compliments <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> received upon it,
					as soon as he was known to be the author, for in the publication he only assumed
					the character of editor, and that not by name. He had earnestly wished, he said,
					to be concealed; probably he did, till its reception was known. All that read
					were his readers. Even at Ranelagh,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"
							>Fashionable pleasure gardens outside London.</note></hi> those who
					remember the publication say, that it was usual for ladies to hold up the
					volumes of <title>Pamela</title> to one another, to shew they had got the book
					that every one was talking of. The tendency of this novel was held to be so
					excellent, that it was recommended by <ref target="people.html#SlocockBenjamin"
						>Dr. Slocock</ref>, even from the pulpit. The friends of the author were
					lavish, not to say extravagant, in their compliments, and he received
					spontaneous eulogiums from many of the first authors of the age. <ref
						target="people.html#LeakeJames">Mr. Leake</ref>
					<pb n="lix"/> thus writes of <ref target="people.html#AllenRalph">Mr.

					&quot;that if all other books were to be burnt, this book, next to the

						target="people.html#LobbSamuel">Mr. Lobb</ref> talks of bringing-up his son
					to be virtuous, by giving him <title>Pamela</title> as soon as he could read, a
					choice of books for a youth which we, at present, should be very much surprised
					at; and <ref target="people.html#LucasRichard">Mr. Lucas</ref>, the esteemed
					author of the <title>Search after Happiness</title>, thus writes: &quot;I am
					inform&apos;d that the author of <title>Pamela</title>, (the best book ever
					published, and calculated to do most good) is one <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>, Printer. I think
					it a piece of common justice, to shew my regard to this common be- <milestone
						n="c 6" unit="signature"/><pb n="lx"/> nefactor of mankind, by making him a
					tender of my best services. Accordingly, being about to publish a volume of
					sermons, I take the liberty of making him the offer of them.&quot; It was
					immediately translated into French and Dutch. </p>
				<p> The fame of this once favourite work is now somewhat tarnished by time, as well
					as eclipsed by the author&apos;s subsequent publications; but the enthusiasm
					with which it was received, shews incontrovertably, that a <hi
						rendition="#italics">novel</hi> written on the side of virtue was considered
					as a new experiment. </p>
				<p> Appreciating it at this distance of time, we must acknowledge that the faults
					are great, but the beauties are genuine. The character of <ref
						target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>, so long as her sole object
					was to resist her master&apos;s attempts, is beautifully drawn, with many
					affecting incidents, and little strokes of nature. Her innocent prattle to <ref
						target="people.html#MrsJervis">Mrs. Jervis</ref>, the rustic dress in which
					she equips herself, when de- <pb n="lxi"/> termined to leave her place, her
					stealing down to the kitchen to try if she could scour the pewter, in order to
					accustom herself to course [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>] household
					work&#8212;&quot;I see I could do it,&quot; says she, &quot;it only blistered my
					hand in two places;&quot; the sudden spring she gives on seeing her father, by
					which she overturns the card-table, and the affecting account of her sufferings
					on attempting to make her escape, are all worthy of a master-hand. There are not
					many under-characters in this work; the most pleasing, and perhaps the best
					sustained, of the whole, are those of <ref target="people.html#AndrewsGoodman"
						>Goodman Andrews</ref> and his wife, <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews"
						>Pamela</ref>&apos;s father and mother. It would not be easy to find a
					prettier picture of low life, and of true English low life, in its most
					respectable garb; made respectable by strict honesty, humility, patience of
					labour, and domestic affection; the whole rendered saintly and venerable by a
					touching air of piety and resignation, which pervades all their senti- <pb

						target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref>&apos;s to enquire after his child; and
					his humble grief, is truly pathetic. The language of the good couple is simple,
					without being vulgar. It is not the simplicity of Arcadian shepherds: It is such
					as people in low life, with the delicacy of a virtuous mind, might fall into
					without any other advantages than a bible education. It is the simplicity of an
					English cottage. <ref target="people.html#MrsJervis">Mrs. Jervis</ref>, the
					virtuous house-keeper, is well-intentioned, grateful, but timid. The other, <ref
						target="people.html#MrsJewkes">Mrs. Jewkes</ref>, is drawn in coarse but
					natural colours. The pride and passion of <ref target="people.html#DaversLady"
						>Lady Davers</ref> are strongly drawn, some may think, perhaps too strongly,
					for a lady of her fashion; but we every now and then see instances in which
					nature will get the better of the decorums of life, and one of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&apos;s correspondents
					tells him he could find him half a dozen <ref target="people.html#DaversLady"
						>Lady Davers</ref>&apos;s (her wit excepted) amongst his quality
					acquaintance. <pb n="lxiii"/></p>
				<p> The character of <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref> himself is drawn
					with less address than that of any one in the piece; he is proud, stern,
					selfish, forbidding, (selfish, that is to say, in his love, for he has
					generosity enough in money matters) and his ideas of the authority of a husband
					are so high, that it is not easy to conceive of <ref
						target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>&apos;s being rewarded by
					marrying him, unless her regard for external circumstances was greater than the
					author would wish to have supposed. The moral of this piece is more dubious
					than, in his life time, the author&apos;s friends were willing to allow. So long
					as <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> is solely occupied in
					schemes to escape from her persecutor, her virtuous resistance obtains our
					unqualified approbation; but from the moment she begins to entertain hopes of
					marrying him, we admire her guarded prudence, rather than her purity of mind.
					She has an end in view, an interested end, and we can only consider her as the
					conscious possessor of a treasure, which <pb n="lxiv"/> she is wisely resolved
					not to part with but for its just price. Her staying in his house a moment after
					she found herself at liberty to leave it, was totally unjustifiable; her
					repentant lover ought to have followed her to her father&apos;s cottage, and to
					have married her from thence. The familiar footing upon which she condescends to
					live with the odious <ref target="people.html#MrsJewkes">Jewkes</ref>, shews
					also, that her fear of offending the man she hoped to make her husband, had got
					the better of her delicacy and just resentment, and the same fear leads her to
					give up her correspondence with honest <ref target="people.html#WilliamsMr">Mr.
						Williams</ref>, who had generously sacrificed his interest with his patron
					in order to effect her deliverance. In real life we should, at this period,
					consider <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> as an interested
					girl; but the author says, she married <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr.
						B.</ref> because he had won her affection, and we are bound, it may be said,
					to believe an author&apos;s own account of his characters. But again, is it
					quite natural that a girl, who had such a <pb n="lxv"/> genuine love for virtue,
					should feel her heart attracted to a man who was endeavouring to destroy that
					virtue? Can a woman value her honour infinitely above her life, and hold in
					serious detestation every word and look contrary to the nicest purity, and yet
					be won by those very attempts against her honour to which she expresses so much
					repugnance? Does not pious love to assimilate with pious, and pure with pure?
					There is, indeed, a gentle seduction of the affections, from which a virtuous
					woman might find herself in danger, especially when there existed such a bar to
					a legitimate union as great disparity of rank and fortune; but this kind of
					seduction was not what <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref> employed. He

				<quote>
					<p rendition="#indent2">Dear Sir,</p>
					<p> I will now write to your question&#8212;Whether there was any original
						groundwork of fact, for the general foundation of <ref
							target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>&apos;s story. </p>
					<p> About twenty-five years ago, a gentleman, with whom I was intimately
						acquainted (but who, alas! is now no more!) met with such a story as that of
							<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>, in one of the
						summer tours which he used to take for his pleasure, attended with one
						servant only. At every inn he put up at, it was his way to inquire after
						curiosities in its neighbourhood, either ancient or modern; and particularly
						he asked who was the owner of a fine house, as it seemed to him, beautifully
						situated, which he had passed by (describing it) within a mile or two of the
						inn. </p>
					<p> It was a fine house, the landlord said. The owner was Mr. B. a gentleman of
						a large estate in more counties than <pb n="lxx"/> one. That his and his
						lady&apos;s history engaged the attention of every body who came that way,
						and put a stop to all other enquiries, though the house and gardens were
						well worth seeing. The lady, he said, was one of the greatest beauties in
						England; but the qualities of her mind had no equal: beneficent, prudent,
						and equally beloved and admired by high and low. That she had been taken at
						twelve years of age, for the sweetness of her manners and modesty, and for
						an understanding above her years, by Mr. B&#8212;&apos;s mother, a truly
						worthy lady, to wait on her person. Her parents, ruined by suretiships, were
						remarkably honest and pious, and had instilled into their daughter&apos;s
						mind the best principles. When their misfortunes happened first, they
						attempted a little school, in their village, where they were much beloved;
						he teaching writing and the first rules of arithmetic to boys; his <pb
							n="lxxi"/> wife plain needle-works to girls; and to knit and spin; but
						that it answered not and, when the lady took their child, the industrious
						man earned his bread by day labour, and the lowest kinds of husbandry. </p>
					<p> That the girl, improving daily in beauty, modesty, and genteel and good
						behaviour, by the time she was fifteen, engaged the attention of her
						lady&apos;s son, a young gentleman of free principles, who, on her
						lady&apos;s death, attempted, by all manner of temptations and devices, to
						seduce her. That she had recourse to as many innocent stratagems to escape
						the snares laid for her virtue; once, however, in despair, having been near
						drowning; that, at last, her noble resistance, watchfulness, and excellent
						qualities, subdued him, and he thought fit to make her his wife. That she
						behaved herself with so much dignity, sweetness, and humility, that she made
							<pb n="lxxii"/> herself beloved of every body, and even by his
						relations, who, at first despised her; and now had the blessings both of
						rich and poor, and the love of her husband. </p>
					<p> The gentleman who told me this, added, that he had the curiosity to stay in
						the neighbourhood from Friday to Sunday, that he might see this happy couple
						at church, from which they never absented themselves: that, in short, he did
						see them; that her deportment was all sweetness, ease, and dignity mingled:
						that he never saw a lovelier woman: that her husband was as fine a man, and
						seemed even proud of his choice: and that she attracted the respects of the
						persons of rank present, and had the blessings of the poor.&#8212;The
						relater of the story told me all this with transport. </p>
					<p> This, Sir, was the foundation of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews"
							>Pamela</ref>&apos;s story; but little did I think to <pb n="lxxiii"/>
						make a story of it for the press. That was owing to this occasion. </p>
					<p>
						<ref target="people.html#RivingtonCharles">Mr. Rivington</ref> and <ref
							target="people.html#OsborneJohn">Mr. Osborne</ref>, whose names are on
						the title-page, had long been urging me to give them a little book (which,
						they said, they were often asked after) of familiar letters on the useful
						concerns in common life; and, at last, I yielded to their importunity, and
						began to recollect such subjects as I thought would be useful in such a
						design, and formed several letters accordingly. And, among the rest, I
						thought of giving one or two as cautions to young folks circumstanced as
							<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> was. Little did I
						think, at first, of making one, much less two volumes of it. But, when I
						began to recollect what had, so many years before, been told me by my
						friend, I thought the story, if written in an easy and natural manner,
						suitably to the simplicity of it, might possibly introduce a new species of
							<fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol.
							i.</hi></fw><milestone n="d" unit="signature"/><pb n="lxxiv"/> writing,
						that might possibly turn young people into a course of reading different
						from the pomp and parade of romance-writing, and dismissing the improbable
						and marvellous, with which novels generally abound, might tend to promote
						the cause of religion and virtue. I therefore gave way to enlargement: and
						so <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> became as you see
						her. But so little did I hope for the approbation of judges, that I had not
						the courage to send the two volumes to your ladies, until I found the books
						well received by the public. </p>
					<p> While I was writing the two volumes, my worthy-hearted wife, and the young
						lady who is with us, when I had read them some part of the story, which I
						had begun without their knowing it, used to come in to my little closet
						every night, with&#8212;&apos;Have you any more of <title>Pamela</title>,
							<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. R.</ref>? We are come to
						hear a little more of <title>Pamela</title>,&apos; &amp;c. This encouraged
							<pb n="lxxv"/> me to prosecute it, which I did so diligently, through
						all my other business, that, by a memorandum on my copy, I began it Nov. 10,
						1739, and finished it Jan. 10, 1739-40. And I have often, censurable as I
						might be thought for my vanity for it, and lessening to the taste of my two
						female friends, had the story of <ref target="people.html#Moliere"
							>Moliere</ref>&apos;s Old Woman in my thoughts upon the occasion. </p>
					<p> If justly low were my thoughts of this little history, you will wonder how
						it came by such an asuming and very impudent preface. It was thus:&#8212;The
						approbation of these two female friends, and of two more, who were so kind
						as to give me prefaces for it, but which were much too long and
						circumstantial, as I thought, made me resolve myself on writing a preface; I
						therefore, spirited by the good opinion of these four, and knowing that the
						judgments of nine parts in ten of readers were but in hang- <milestone
							n="d 2" unit="signature"/><pb n="lxxvi"/> ing-sleeves, struck a bold
						stroke in the preface you see, having the umbrage of the editor&apos;s
							character<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Under the character of

								blamed by some of his friends [<ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs"

				<p> The success of the work gave occasion to a spurious continuation of it, called
						<hi rendition="#italics"><title>Pamela in High Life</title></hi>. The author
					had, in reality, no reason to be disturbed at this; the continuation would have
					had the same fate with that of <title>Marianne</title>, afterwards published,
					which no one ever confounded with the <title>Marianne</title> of <ref
						target="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</ref>. However, upon this, the author
					prepared to give a second part. <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander"
						>Pope</ref> and <ref target="people.html#WarburtonWilliam">Warburton</ref>,
					who heard he was about it, advised him to make it a vehicle for satire upon the

					when she was introduced to them. The plan might have <pb n="lxxvii"/> suited
						<ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref> or <ref
						target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, but <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> did not, by any
					means, possess those light touches of delicate humour which were required in it;
					and the knowledge of the great world he had yet to acquire. These volumes, two
					in number, are, like most second parts, greatly inferior to the first. They are
					superfluous, for the plan was already completed, and they are dull, for instead
					of incident and passion, they are filled with heavy sentiment, in diction far
					from elegant. A great part of it aims to palliate, by counter criticism, the
					faults which had been found in the first part. It is less a continuation than
					the author&apos;s defence of himself. The only incident of consequence is, the
					adventure at the masquerade, and <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr.
					B.</ref>&apos;s beginning intrigue with a lady there, which gives <ref
						target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> an opportunity to shine in
					so critical a circumstance as a married jealousy; her behaviour under it is very
					well drawn, with a proper mixture of acute feeling, spirit, and gentleness, and

						>Pamela</ref>, and <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref> is

					was exceedingly hurt at this; the more so, as they had been upon good terms, and
					he was very intimate with <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry"
					>Fielding</ref>&apos;s two sisters. He never appears cordially to have forgiven
					it, (perhaps it was not in human nature that he should) and he always speaks in
					his letters with a great deal of asperity of <title>Tom Jones</title>, more
					indeed than was quite graceful in a rival author. No doubt he himself thought
					his indignation was solely excited by the loose morality of the work and of its
					author, but he could tolerate <ref target="people.html#CibberColley"
						>Cibber</ref>. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
					and <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> possessed very
					different excellencies.&#8212;<ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry"
						>Fielding</ref> had all the ease which <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> wanted, a genuine
					flow of humour, and a rich variety of comic character; nor was he wanting in
					strokes of an amiable <milestone n="d 4" unit="signature"/><pb n="lxxx"/>
					sensibility, but he could not describe a consistently virtuous character, and in
					deep pathos he was far excelled by his rival. When we see <ref
						target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> parodying
						<title>Pamela</title>, and <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> asserting, as he does in his letters, that the run of
						<title>Tom Jones</title> is over, and that it would be soon completely
					forgotten: we cannot but smile on seeing the two authors placed on the same
					shelf, and going quietly down to posterity together. <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, encouraged by the
					applauses, and benefited by the criticisms he had received, soon proceeded to a
					new work. </p>
				<p> But <title>Pamela</title>, captivating as was the publication, shewed only the
					dawn of our author&apos;s genius; and, if he sunk in the second part of it, it
					was only to rise with new lustre in <title>Clarissa</title>, the first two
					volumes of which were published eight years after the preceding. </p>
				<p>The production upon which the fame of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> is principally founded, that <pb n="lxxxi"/> which will
					transmit his name to posterity, as one of the first geniuses of the age in which
					he lived, is undoubtedly his <hi rendition="#italics"
						><title>Clarissa</title></hi>. Nothing can be more simple than the
					story,&#8212;A young lady, pressed by her parents to marry a man every way
					disagreeable to her, and placed under the most cruel restraint, leaves her
					father&apos;s house, and throws herself upon the protection of her lover, a man
					of sense and spirit, but a libertine. When he finds her in his power he artfully
					declines marriage, and conveys her to a house kept for the worst of purposes.
					There, after many fruitless attempts to ensnare her virtue, he at length
					violates her person. She escapes from further outrage: he finds her out in her
					retreat; offers her marriage, which she rejects. Her friends are obdurate. She
					retires to solitary lodgings; grief and shame overwhelm her, and she dies
					broken-hearted: her friends lament their severity when too late. Her violator is
					transiently stung with remorse, but not <milestone n="d 5" unit="signature"/><pb
						n="lxxxii"/> reformed; he leaves the kingdom in order to dissipate his
					chagrin, and is killed in a duel by a relation of the lady&apos;s. </p>
				<p> On this slight foundation, and on a story not very agreeable or promising in its
					rude outline, has our author founded a most pathetic tale, and raised a noble
					temple to female virtue. The first volumes are somewhat tedious, from the
					prolixity incident to letter-writing, and require a persevering reader to get
					through them: but the circumstantial manner of writing which <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> practised, has the
					advantage of making the reader thoroughly acquainted with those in whose fate he
					is to be interested. In consequence of this, our feelings are not transient,
					elicited here and there by a pathetic stroke; but we regard his characters as
					real personages, whom we know and converse with, and whose fate remains to be
					decided in the course of events. The characters, much more numerous than in
						<title>Pamela</title>, are all <pb n="lxxxiii"/> distinctly drawn and well
					preserved, and there is a proper contrast and variety in the casting of the
					parts. The plot, as we have seen, is simple, and no under-plots interfere with
					the main design. No digressions, no episodes. It is wonderful that without these
					helps of common writers, he could support a work of such length. With <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> it begins,&#8212;with
						<ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> it ends. We do not
					come upon unexpected adventures and wonderful recognitions, by quick turns and
					surprises: we see her fate from afar, as it were through a long avenue, the
					gradual approach to which, without ever losing sight of the object, has more of
					simplicity and grandeur than the most cunning labyrinth that can be contrived by
					art. In the approach to the modern country seat, we are made to catch
					transiently a side-view of it through an opening of the trees, or to burst upon
					it from a sudden turning in the road; but the old mansion stood full <milestone
						n="d 6" unit="signature"/><pb n="lxxxiv"/> in the eye of the traveller, as
					he drew near it, contemplating its turrets, which grew larger and more distinct
					every step that he advanced; and leisurely filling his eye and his imagination
					with still increasing ideas of its magnificence. As the work advances, the
					character rises; the distress is deepened; our hearts are torn with pity and
					indignation; bursts of grief succeed one another, till at length the mind is
					composed and harmonized with emotions of milder sorrow; we are calmed into
					resignation, elevated with pious hope, and dismissed glowing with the conscious
					triumphs of virtue. </p>
				<p> The first group which presents itself is that of the Harlowe family. They are
					sufficiently discriminated, yet preserve a family likeness. The stern father,
					the passionate and dark-souled brother, the envious and ill-natured sister, the
					money-loving uncles, the gentle, but weak-spirited mother, are all assimilated
					by that <pb n="lxxxv"/> stiffness, love of parade, and solemnity, which is
					thrown over the whole, and by the interested family views in which they all
					concur. <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref> is a young lady

					a man deserving of her esteem, but prim and formal in his manner. <ref
						target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref> is a character of strong

						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>&apos;s narrative of
					events, as that between <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> and
					his friend Bedford is of his schemes and designs. The character of <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> herself is very highly
					wrought: she has all the grace, and dignity, and delicacy, of a finished model
					of female excellence. Her duty to her parents is implicit, except in the article
					of <pb n="lxxxvi"/> sacrificing herself to a man utterly disgustful to her; and
					she bears, with the greatest meekness, the ill usage she receives from the other
					branches of the family. Duty, indeed, is the great principle of her conduct. Her
					affections are always compleatly under command; and her going off with <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> appears a step she was
					betrayed, not persuaded, into. His persuasions she had withstood, and it was
					fear, not love, that at last precipitated her into his protection. If,
					therefore, the author meant to represent her subsequent misfortunes as a
					punishment, he has scarcely made her faulty enough. That a young lady has eloped
					from her father&apos;s house with a libertine, sounds, indeed, like a grave
					offence; but the fault, when it is examined into, is softened, and shaded off by
					such a variety of circumstances, that it becomes almost evanescent. Who that
					reads the treatment she experienced, does not wonder at her long-suffering.
					After <pb n="lxxxvii"/>
					<ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> finds herself, against
					her will and intention, in the power of her lover, the story becomes, for a
					while, a game at chess, in which both parties exert great skill and presence of
					mind, and quick observation of each others motions. Not a moment of weakness
					does <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> betray, and she
					only loses the game because she plays fairly, and with integrity, while he is
					guilty of the basest frauds. </p>
				<p> During this part of the story, the generality of readers are perhaps inclined to
					wish, that <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> should give up his
					wicked intentions, reform, and make <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> happy in the marriage state. This was the conclusion which
						<ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaw</ref> so
					vehemently and passionately urged the author to adopt. But when the unfeeling
					character of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> proceeds to
					deeper and darker wickedness, when his unrelenting cruelty meditates, and
					actually perpetrates, the last unmanly outrage upon <pb n="lxxxviii"/>
					unprotected innocence and virtue; the heart surely cannot have right feelings
					that does not cordially detest so black a villain, notwithstanding the agreeable
					qualities which are thrown into his character, and that woman must have little
					delicacy, who does not feel that his crime has raised an eternal wall of
					separation between him and the victim of his treachery, whatever affection she
					might have previously entertained for him. Yet it is said by some, that the
					author has made <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> too agreeable,
					and his character has been much the object of criticism. But a little reflection
					will shew us, that the author had a more difficult part to manage, in drawing
					his character, than that of any other in the work, and that he could not well
					have made him different from what he is. If he had drawn a mean-spirited dark
					villain, without any specious qualities, his <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> would have been
					degraded. <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, as he is to win the
					affections <pb n="lxxxix"/> of the heroine, is necessarily, in some sort, the
					hero of the piece, and no one in it must be permitted to outshine him. The
					author, therefore, gives him wit and spirit, and courage, and generosity, and
					manly genteel address, and also transient gleams of feeling, and transient
					stings of remorse; so that we are often led to hope he may follow his better
					angel, and give up his atrocious designs. This the author has done, and less he
					could not do, for the man whom <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> was inclined to favour. Besides, if it was part of his
					intention to warn young women against placing their affections upon libertines,
					it was certainly only against the agreeable ones of that class, that he had any
					occasion to warn them. He tells us in one of his letters, that finding he had
					made him too much a favourite, he had thrown in some darker shades to obviate
					the objection; and surely the shades are dark enough. In one particular,
					however, the author might per- <pb n="xc"/> haps have improved the moral effect
					of the work; he might have given more of horror to the last scene of <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>&apos;s life. When <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> and he were finally
					separated, there was no occasion to keep measures with him; and why should <ref
						target="people.html#Belton">Belton</ref> die a death of so much horror, and
						<ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> of calm composure and
					self-possession. <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> dies in a
					duel, admirably well described, in which he behaves with the cool intrepidity of
					a gentleman and a man of spirit. <ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel
						Morden</ref> could not behave better. Some tender strokes are thrown in on
					his parting with <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref>, and on other
					occasions, tending to interest the reader in his favour; and his last words,
					&quot;Let this expiate,&quot; are manifestly intended to do away our resentment,
					and leave a favourable impression on our minds with regard to his future
					prospects. Something, indeed, is mentioned of impatience, and a desire of life;
					but <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&#32;<hi
						rendition="#italics"> could</hi> have drawn a scene which would have made us
						<pb n="xci"/> turn with horror from the features of the gay, the agreeable
					seducer, when changed into the agonizing countenance of the despairing
					self-accuser. </p>
				<p> But, if the author might have improved, in this respect, the character of <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, that of <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> comes up to all the
					ideas we can form of female loveliness and dignified suffering. The first scenes
					with her hard-hearted family, shew the severe struggles she had with herself,
					before she could withdraw her obedience from her parents. The measure of that
					obedience, in <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&apos;s
					mind, was very high; and, therefore, <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> seems all along, rather to lament the cruelty, than to
					resent the injustice, of imposing a husband upon her without her own consent. It
					is easy to see she would have thought it her duty to comply, if he had not been
					quite so disagreeable. The mother is a very mean character; she gives a tacit
					permission to <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, to
					correspond with <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, to prevent
					mischief, and <pb n="xcii"/> yet consents to be the tool of the family in
					persecuting her innocent and generous daughter;&#8212;but, this was her duty to
					her husband!&#8212;Yet, distressing as <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref>&apos;s situation is in her father&apos;s house, the author
					has had the address to make the reader feel, the moment she has got out of it,
					that he would give the world to have her safe back again. Nothing takes place of
					that pleasure and endearment which might naturally be expected on the meeting of
					two lovers; we feel that she has been hunted into the toils, and that every
					avenue is closed against her escape. No young person, on reading
						<title>Clarissa</title>, even at this period of the story, can think of
					putting herself into the power of a lover, without annexing to it the strongest
					sense of degradation and anxiety. A great deal of contrivance is expended by the
					author, in the various plots set on foot by <ref target="people.html#Lovelace"
						>Lovelace</ref>, to keep his victim toterably [<hi rendition="#italics"
						>sic</hi>] easy in her ambiguous situation; and, though some of these <pb
						n="xciii"/> are tedious, it was necessary, for <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>&apos;s honour, to make
					the reader sensible that she had an inextricable net wound around her, and that
					it was not owing to her want of prudence or vigilance, that she did not escape.
					In the mean time the wit of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>,
					and the sprightliness of <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref>,
					prevent monotony. In one instance, however, <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> certainly sins against
					the delicacy of her character, that is, in allowing herself to be made a show of
					to the loose companions of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace"
					>Lovelace</ref>:&#8212;But, how does her character rise, when we come to the
					more distressful scenes; the view of her horror, when, deluded by the pretended
					relations, she re-enters the fatal house, her temporary insanity after the
					outrage, in which she so affectingly holds up to <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> the licence he had procured,
					and her dignified behaviour when she first sees her ravisher, after the
					perpetration of his crime. What finer subject could be <pb n="xciv"/> presented
					to the painter, than that in which <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> grasps the pen-knife in her hand, her eyes lifted up to
					heaven, the whites of them only visible, ready to plunge it in her breast, to
					preserve herself from further outrage: <ref target="people.html#Lovelace"
						>Lovelace</ref>, aghast with terror, and speechless, thrown back to the
					further end of the room? Or, the prison scene, where she is represented kneeling
					amidst the gloom and horror of the dismal abode; illuminating, as it were, the
					dark chamber, her face reclined on her crossed arms, her white garments floating
					round her in the negligence of woe; <ref target="people.html#Belford"
						>Belford</ref> contemplating her with respectful commiseration; or, the
					scene of calmer, but heart-piercing sorrow, in the interview <ref
						target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref> has with her in her
					dying moments: She is represented fallen into a slumber, in her elbow-chair,
					leaning on the <ref target="people.html#WidowLovick">widow Lovick</ref>, whose
					left arm is around her neck; one faded check resting on the <pb n="xcv"/> good
					woman&apos;s bosom, the kindly warmth of which had overspread it with a faintish
					flush, the other pale and hollow, as if already iced over by death; her hands,
					the blueness of the veins contrasting their whiteness, hanging lifelessly before
					her, the widow&apos;s tears dropping unfelt upon her face&#8212;<ref
						target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref>, with his arms
					folded, gazing on her in silence, her coffin just appearing behind a screen.
					What admiration, what reverence does the author inspire us with for the innocent
					sufferer, the sufferings too of such a peculiar nature. </p>

				<p> This is a sentiment much too generous for a <ref target="people.html#Lovelace"
						>Lovelace</ref>.&#8212;The author has shewn himself embarrassed with regard
					to the duel, by his principles, which forbade duelling. Yet, it was necessary to
					dispatch <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>; for what family
					could sit down with such an injury unpunished? or which of his readers could be
					satisfied to see the perpetrator of so much mischief escape vengeance. <ref
						target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref> was a man of <pb
						n="xcix"/> the world, acted upon the maxims of it, and, therefore, it seemed
					hardly necessary to make him express regret at having precipitated <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> into a future state; <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was not then drawing
					his perfect character, and did not seem called upon to blame a duel, which, in
					our hearts we cannot, from <ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel
						Morden</ref>, but approve of. </p>
				<p> That <title>Clarissa</title> is a highly moral work, has been always allowed;
					but what is the moral? Is it that a young lady who places her affections upon a
					libertine, will be deceived and ruined. Though the author, no doubt, intended
					this as one of the conclusions to be drawn, such a maxim has not dignity or
					force enough in it, to be the chief moral of this interesting tale. And, it has
					been already mentioned, that <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> can hardly stand as an example of such a choice, as she
					never fairly made the choice. On the contrary, she is always ready, both before
					her elopement and after <milestone n="e 2" unit="signature"/><pb n="c"/> it, to
					resign the moderate, the almost insensible predilection she feels for <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, to the will of her parents; if
					she might only be permitted to refuse the object of her aversion. Is she, then,
					exhibited as a rare pattern of chastity? Surely this is an idea very degrading
					to the sex. <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, indeed, who has a
					very bad opinion of women, and thinks that hardly any woman can resist him,
					talks of trying her virtue, and speaks as if he expected her to fail in the
					trial. But, surely, the virtue of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> could never have been in the smallest danger. The virtue of
						<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> was tried, because the
					pecuniary offers were a temptation which many, in, her station of life, would
					have yielded to; and, because their different situations in life opposed a bar
					to their legitimate union, which she might well believe would be insuperable.
					The virtue of Werter&apos;s Charlotte was tried, and the virtue of the wife of
						Zeleuco<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Characters in <ref

								rendition="#italics">Zeluco</hi>, respectively</note></hi> was
					tried, because the previous marriage of one of the par- <pb n="ci"/> ties made a
					virtuous union impossible.&#8212;But <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref>! a young lady of birth and fortune, marriage completely in
					her lover&apos;s power&#8212;she could have felt nothing but indignation at the
					first idea which entered her mind, that he meant to degrade her into a mistress.
					Was it likely that she, who had shewn that her affections were so much under her
					command, while the object of his addresses appeared to be honourable marriage,
					should not guard against every freedom with the most cautious vigilance, as soon
					as she experienced a behaviour in him, which must at once destroy her esteem for
					him, and be offensive to her just pride, as well as to her modesty? It is
					absurd, therefore, in <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> to speak
					of trying her chastity; and the author is not free from blame in favouring the
					idea that such resistance had any thing in it uncommon, or peculiarly
					meritorious. But the real moral of <title>Clarissa</title> is, that virtue is
					triumphant in every situation; that in cir- <milestone n="e 3" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="cii"/> cumstances the most painful and degrading, in a prison, in a
					brothel, in grief, in distraction, in despair, it is still lovely, still
					commanding, still the object of our veneration, of our fondest affections; that
					if it is seated on the ground it can still say with Constance, <quote><lg

				<p> The Novelist that has produced this effect, has performed his office well, and
					it is immaterial what particular maxim is selected under the name of a moral,
					while such are the reader&apos;s feelings. If our feelings are in favour of
					virtue, the novel is virtuous; if of vice, the novel is vicious. The greatness
					of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> is shewn by her
					separating herself from her lover, as soon as she perceives his dishonourable
					views; in her chusing death rather than a repetition of the outrage; in her
					rejection of those overtures of marriage, which a common mind might have
					accepted of, as a refuge against worldly dishonour; in her firm indignant
					carriage <pb n="ciii"/> mixed with calm patience and christian resignation, and
					in the greatness of mind with which she views and enjoys the approaches of
					death, and her meek forgiveness of her unfeeling relations. In one particular
					the author has been blamed, and perhaps justly, for encouraging superstition, in
					representing <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> so greatly
					terrified at the curse laid upon her by her unnatural father. He may be faulty
					as a moralist, but it has a good dramatic effect: and, I question if <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> went much beyond his
					own ideas of the efficacy of a parent&apos;s curse on this occasion. The too
					high colouring of some of the scenes has been objected to, as tending to inflame
					passions which it was the author&apos;s professed aim to regulate. He was led to
					it, in some measure, by the nature of his story, but he seems to have begun
					writing with a coarseness of ideas in this respect, which he got rid of by
					degrees. His <title>Clarissa</title> is far less objectionable than his
						<title>Pamela</title>; his <title>Grandison</title> not <milestone n="e 4"
						unit="signature"/><pb n="civ"/> at all so. The death of Sinclair is painted
					with great strength, but excites painful disgust as well as horror; yet, being
					intended to excite a salutary disgust to the haunts of vice and infamy; perhaps,
					in that light may be borne with. Its operation is that of a strong medicine,
					meant to create a nausea. The death of <ref target="people.html#Belton"
						>Belton</ref> is an admirable piece of painting, and not excelled by any
					thing in the admired scene of Cardinal Beaufort.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot"><ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"
								>Shakespeare</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Henry VI, Part

				</p>
				<p> It is not perfectly delicate that <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> should have so many interviews with <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> after the catastrophe. <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, indeed, could not help
					it, but the author could. He should only have exhibited them together in those
					few striking scenes in which our feelings are wound up to the highest pitch. No
					long parleys, nothing that can be called trivial should pass between them then.
					If the reader, on opening casually the book, can doubt of any scene between
					them, whether it passes before or after the outrage, that scene is one too much.
						<pb n="cv"/>
				</p>
				<p>The character of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, though
					laboured with great art, is, perhaps, after all, more of a fancy piece than a
					real portrait of an English libertine. Where is the libertine who would attempt
					in England the seduction of young women, guarded by birth and respectable
					situations in life, and friends jealous of their honour, and an education which
					would set them far out of the reach of any disgraceful overtures. A love of
					intrigue, rather than a love of pleasure, characterizes <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>; he is a cool systematic
					seducer, and the glory of conquest is what he principally aims at. Had such a
					character been placed in France, and his gallantries directed to married women,
					it would have been more natural, and his epistolary memoirs rendered more
					probable; but, in England, <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>
					would have been run through the body, long before he had seen the face of <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, or <ref
						target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref>. </p>
				<p> There is an improbability which the <milestone n="e 5" unit="signature"/><pb
						n="cvi"/> author could not well avoid, as it resulted from his plan of
					carrying on the narrative by letters, and that is, the tame acquiescence of <ref
						target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> in a villainy which he all along
					so strongly disapproves. It is true, as a man of honour, he might think himself
					obliged not to betray his friend&apos;s secrets, but his disapprobation would
					certainly have prevented his friend from communicating those secrets. <ref
						target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> is, in fact, reformed, from the
					time we first hear of him; and, therefore, those intimate communications could
					not any longer have subsisted. But <ref target="people.html#Belford"
						>Belford</ref> is a being, created in order to carry on the story, and must
					not be made too strictly the object of criticism. A novel writer must violate
					probability somewhere, and a reader ought to make all handsome and generous
					allowances for it. We should open a book as we enter into a company, well
					persuaded that we must not expect perfection. In <ref
						target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref>, too, we have a reformed
					libertine, one whom the reader <pb n="cvii"/> regards with esteem and affection.
						<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> mentions in one
					of his letters, that <ref target="people.html#MooreEdward">Mr. More</ref>,
					author of <title>the Foundling</title>, had an intention of bringing the story
					of <title>Clarissa</title> upon the stage, and that <ref
						target="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</ref> told him he should with
					great pleasure be the <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> of it.

				<p> The publication of <title>Pamela</title> occasioned the sensation of surprize

				<p> French travellers often shew their admiration of this work, by enquiry after
					little local circumstances mentioned in it. <pb n="cix"/> The writer of these
					observations well remembers a Frenchman who paid a visit to Hampstead, for the
					sole purpose of finding out the house in the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>flask-walk</hi> where <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe"
						>Clarissa</ref> lodged, and was surprised at the ignorance or indifference
					of the inhabitants on that subject. The <hi rendition="#italics">flask-walk</hi>
					was to him as much classic ground as the rocks of Meillerie to the admirers of
						<ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</ref>; and, probably,
					if an English traveller were to make similar enquiries in Switzerland, he would
					find that the rocks of Meillerie, and the <hi rendition="#italics">chalets</hi>
					of the Valais, suggested no ideas to the inhabitants, but such as were connected
					with their dairies and their farms. A constant residence soon destroys all
					sensibility to objects of local enthusiasm. </p>
				<p> The interest which <title>Clarissa</title> excited, was increased by the
					suspense in which its readers were so long held. In general, the suspense of a
					reader lasts no longer than the time which is necessary <pb n="cx"/> for him to
					read the book; and, in the case of a book which is much talked of, very few
					readers enjoy the full pleasure of the story, as they can scarcely help
					learning, from some quarter or other, how it is to end. But, in this instance,
					the interval of several months, which was allowed to pass between the
					publication of the first four volumes, and the remaining four, wound up its
					readers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm; and, it is really impossible to
					conceive greater earnestness in a matter of real life and death, than some of
					his correspondents expressed in favour of the heroine. One who signs Philaretes,
					thus expresses himself:&#8212;&quot;Since I have heard that you design the end
					shall be unhappy, I am determined to read no more; I should read the account of
					her death with as much anguish of mind as I should feel at the loss of my
					dearest friend.&quot; Some entreated, others threatened. The veteran <ref
						target="people.html#CibberColley">Cibber</ref> was quite out- <pb n="cxi"/>
					rageous at the idea of an unhappy termination, and the ladies pleaded&#8212;but
					in vain. To have made a different ending, the author well knew would have
					spoiled his work; yet, he could not but have been secretly flattered with seeing
					the strong impression he had made. That a work is canvassed, is criticised,
					ought to present no disagreeable idea to an author. He alone has to complain of
					the public, of whose book it says nothing. To the author&apos;s supreme talent
					of moving the passions, every one bore witness. <ref
						target="people.html#DuncombeSusanna">Miss Highmore</ref> expresses herself
					in a pretty and touching manner on this subject:&#8212;&quot;What must have been
					your feelings, at the time you wrote what nobody can read without streaming eyes
					and heart-breaking sorrow? It has had the same effect on my father and mother as
					on myself. We could none of us read aloud the affecting scenes we met with, but
					each read to ourselves, and in separate apartments wept.&quot; <ref
						target="people.html#DuncombeSusanna">Miss High-</ref>
					<pb n="cxii"/>
					<ref target="people.html#DuncombeSusanna">more</ref> was not mistaken in her
					idea of the feelings the author must have had in writing his work. He bore
					testimony to the maxim <hi rendition="#italics">si vis me flere dolendum est
						primum ipsi tibi</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">&quot;If you
							wish me to weep, you yourself must first feel grief&quot;; <ref

									><title>Ars Poetica</title></hi> (c. 18 BCE) 102-3.</note></hi>
					for, he says, in one of his letters, that <title>Clarissa</title> has cost him
					as many tears as any of his readers. A number of correspondencies were the
					consequence of his celebrity; but, certainly the most singular compliment he
					ever received, though probably not the most acceptable, was from a lady who had
					herself written a novel, and signs Cleomira; she says, &quot;I am more and more
					charmed with your <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>; it
					is, indeed, a noble character; but, I fear, no where to be met with except in
					your letters. What a pity it is you are not a woman, and blest with means of
					shining as she did; for, a person capable of drawing such a character, would
					certainly be able to act in the same manner, if in a like situation.&quot; <pb

				<p> The <ref target="people.html#Prevostabbe">Abb&#233; Prevost</ref> gave a version
					of <title>Clarissa</title> into French, but rather an abridgment than a
					translation. It was afterwards rendered more faithfully by <ref
						target="people.html#LeTourneurP">Le Tourneur</ref>. <ref
						target="people.html#Prevostabbe">Prevost</ref> says, and truly, that
						<title>Clarissa</title> required some softening to adapt it to the more
					delicate taste of the French. It was also translated into Dutch by <ref
						target="people.html#StinstraJohannes">Mr. Stinstra</ref>, and into German
					under the auspices of the celebrated <ref target="people.html#HallerAlbrechtvon"
						>Dr. Haller</ref>. </p>
				<p> Our author was now at the zenith of his fame, but his fancy was not exhausted,
					nor his powers of writing diminished; and, after an interval of between four and
					five years, he again appeared before the public. </p>
				<p> After <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> had
					published two works, in each of which the principal character is a female, he
					determined to give the world an example of <hi rendition="#italics">a perfect
						man</hi>. His laudable design was to unite every thing that is graceful and
					engaging in the man of spirit and the fine gentleman, with every moral virtue,
					and with the observance <pb n="cxiv"/> of the strict rules of
					Christianity&#8212;an arduous undertaking!</p>
				<p> He was partly stimulated to this design by the attacks of his female disciples,
					who, in answer to the reproaches he made them of liking <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> too well, observed to him, that
					he had given them nobody else to like:&#8212;the virtuous <ref
						target="people.html#MrHickman">Hickman</ref> was too tame and too formal to
					do justice to his good principles; and, in short, that he had not presented them
					with one male character, on which the imagination might rest with complacence.
					If he did not wish they should regard men of pleasure with too favourable an
					eye, it was his duty to provide some one whom they might like upon principle.
					Upon this idea he determined to give them <hi rendition="#italics"><title>A Good
							Man</title></hi>, the title by which he always speaks of the work while
					he is writing it, though he afterwards changed it to that of <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>Sir Charles Grandison</title></hi>. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> is a man of
					birth and for- <pb n="cxv"/> tune, endowed with every personal advantage, and
					master of every fashionable accomplishment. He is placed in a variety of
					situations, calculated to draw forth the virtues and energies of his character,
					as a son, a brother, a guardian, a friend, and a lover; and his conduct is every
					where exemplary. He is a man of address, of knowledge of the world, and makes
					himself to be respected in different countries, and by all sorts of people, bad
					as well as good. He is generous without profusion; religious without
					superstition; complaisant without weakness, firm in his purposes, rapid in the
					execution of them; jealous of his honour, yet always open to a generous
					reconciliation, feeling (at least as the author would have us believe) the
					passions of human nature, yet always possessing a perfect command over them. </p>
				<p> The conduct of this piece differs from that of <title>Pamela</title> and
						<title>Clarissa</title> in this respect; that it does not depend upon one
					great <pb n="cxvi"/> event, but is intended to open and display this character
					in a variety of lights. The unity of the work, therefore, consists in the
					reference which every person, and every incident, bears to him who is the hero
					of it. Of him the author never loses sight after his first appearance, which he
					makes as soon as the reader has been prepared by the play of some inferior
					characters, (who, to use a military phrase, <hi rendition="#italics">keep the
						ground</hi> for him) in a brilliant action, the rescuing the lady, he is
					finally to marry, from the hands of a lawless ravisher. </p>
				<p> It was necessary for the execution of the plan, and it is so contrived, in fact,
					that this work should be diversified with a greater variety of characters than
					his former ones. It has, particularly, many more of the pleasing cast. The
					author shews in it, that he had improved in the knowledge of life and the
					genteel world; and there are none of those warm descriptions in it which were
					justly blamed in its two elder <pb n="cxvii"/> sisters. He has an <hi
						rendition="#italics">enl&#233;vement</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot">Abduction. </note></hi> a [<hi rendition="#italics"
						>sic</hi>] incident he seems to have been fond of, since it occurs in all
					the three works; but the object is only marriage, and it is managed with perfect
					decorum, at the same time that it presents a truly affecting scene. The early
					part of the novel presents a rich display of incidents and personages. The
					history of Sir Thomas and Lady Grandison is admirably executed, and highly
					moral. The behaviour of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> to his father&apos;s mistress, to his sisters, to his uncle
					Lord W., to the <ref target="people.html#Danbys">Danbys</ref>, is all excellent,
					and opens his character to the greatest advantage. But the chief intrigue of the
					piece arises from the double love of <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> to <ref
						target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> and <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>. A double love, say the
					critics in that passion, is no love at all; and they will insist upon it, that
						<ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> is all along
					actuated by compassion solely for both the ladies. </p>
				<p> The character of <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> is
					meant by the author as a model of true female <pb n="cxviii"/> excellence; but
					it is judiciously kept down, not only with relation to <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, but to the
					high-wrought portrait of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">the Italian
						lady</ref>. <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> is
					gentle, timid, and somewhat passive; her character has no very prominent
					feature, except her love for <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref>. As she was destined to reward the hero, the author has shewn
					great address in previously interesting his readers in her favour, before we
					become acquainted with <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>; so
					that, notwithstanding our admiration for the latter, and the strong feelings she
					has called out, we all along consider the Italian family as intruders, and are
					glad, upon the whole, when <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is disengaged from them. We adore <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, but we come <hi
						rendition="#italics">home</hi> to <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron"
						>Miss Byron</ref>. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had been accused of
					giving a coldness to his female characters in the article of love. The
					accusation was ill-founded; for the circumstances of the story in his two former
					pieces forbade the <pb n="cxix"/> display of a very tender sensibility; but he
					has made ample amends for the imputed omission in his <title>Grandison</title>,
					where he has entered into the passion with all the minuteness, and delicacy, and
					warmth, that could be desired, and shewn the female heart to be open to him in
					all its folds and recesses. In his Olivia, his <ref
						target="people.html#HarrietByron">Harriet</ref>, his <ref
						target="people.html#EmilyJervois">Emily</ref>, his <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, he has well exemplified

				</p>
				<p> But, as the character of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is the most instructive, that of <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> is the highest effort of
					genius in this piece. In her, he has drawn a young creature involved in a
					passion expressed with the utmost innocence and delicacy, yet so strong as to
					overturn her reason; and af- <pb n="cxx"/> terwards, on the recovery of her
					reason, after a severe struggle, voluntarily sacrificing that very passion at
					the shrine of religious principle. <ref target="people.html#Clementina"
						>Clementina</ref> is indeed a heroine, and her conduct is truly noble,
					because, with her articles of faith, the obstacle was, in reality,
					insurmountable to a well principled mind. Her faith might be erroneous; but her
					conduct, grounded on that faith, was just and rational. This sentiment is
					insisted on, because some good protestants have called <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> a poor narrow-minded bigot.
					A bigot she certainly was; but it had been strange if she had not believed the
					religion in which she had been carefully educated, and she only acted
					consistently with that belief. It were superfluous to any one who has perused
					this work, to remark the masterly manner in which the madness of <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> is painted. <ref
						target="people.html#WartonJoseph">Dr. Warton</ref> speaks thus of it:
						<quote><p>I know not whether even the madness <pb n="cxxi"/> of Lear is wrought
						up and expressed by so many little strokes of nature and passion. It is

					and innocence in her wanderings, such affecting starts of passion, such a
					significant woe in her looks and attitudes, such a sanctity of mind, with so
					much passion, that he who is not moved with it, must resign the pretension of
					being accessible to fictitious sorrow. </p>
				<p> It is the fault of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
					that he never knew when to have done with a character: that of <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> would have been dismissed
					with dignity after her refusal of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison"
						>Sir Charles</ref>; instead of which, he resumes her story in the last
					volumes, brings her to England, a step little consistent with the delicacy of
					her character, nor necessary to any event; and, finally, leaves the reader to
					conclude that she will be brought to accept the hand of the <ref

					and na- <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol.

					he have disposed of her in a convent, there to complete the sacrifice she had
					made of her love to her religion. He probably would have done so, if a desire of
					making his piece instructive had not, in this instance, warped his judgment, and
					restrained his genius. He was in the habit of inveighing to his young friends
					against romantic ideas of love, and particularly the notion that a first passion
					could not be conquered, and he feared it would have a bad effect if he
					represented the contrary in his works.<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">I

				</p>
				<p> But though, in real life, a passion, however strong, will generally give way to
					time, at least so far as to permit the disappointed party to fill her proper
					station in social life, and fulfil the relative duties of it with calm
					complacence, if not with delight, we cannot easily figure to ourselves that <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, with such a high-toned
					mind, <pb n="cxxiii"/> and a passion so exalted, a passion that had shaken the
					very seat of reason in her soul, could, or with so shattered an intellect ought,
					to turn her thoughts to a second lover. Novels will always be different from
					real life, and therefore always, perhaps, in some degree, dangerous to the young
					mind; but they must be consistent with themselves; and if the author chose to
					describe a passion which unhinged the reason of one lady, and was sinking the
					other to the grave, a catastrophe which we are led to suppose would have been
					the effect of <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>&apos;s
					final disappointment, he should not then have been scrupulous of allowing it to
					have its full effect. </p>
				<p> Great debates took place in the author&apos;s female senate concerning the point
					we have been discussing. Some voted for killing <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, and very few were
					satisfied with the termination, as it stands; which, however, is only distantly
					implied, as, at the conclusion of <title>Le Cid</title> of <ref
						target="people.html#CorneillePierre">Corneille</ref>, we are led to suppose
					that Chimene <milestone n="f 2" unit="signature"/><pb n="cxxiv"/> will, in due
					time, give her hand to Don Rodrigue. </p>
				<p> The correspondence, in these volumes, is carried on, for the most part, between
						<ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> and her friends and
					Lady G. <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>&apos;s
					sister, on the one side, and <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> and Dr. Bartlett, (a respectable clergyman) on the other. Lady
					G.&apos;s character is sprightly and petulant, and her letters have a good deal
					of wit, though sometimes it degenerates into flippancy. She resembles <ref
						target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref>, but with less of fire and
					ardour, and more of levity. She behaves to her husband still more provokingly
					than that lady to <ref target="people.html#MrHickman">Mr. Hickman</ref>.
					Notwithstanding, however, the general resemblance just suggested, and a few
					others that might be pointed out, there is no man, perhaps, who has written so
					much, and who has less repeated himself, than <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>. If we may judge by
					the variety of characters in this, his last publication, the fertility of his
					fancy was by no means <pb n="cxxv"/> exhausted. Of all the under characters,
					none is more delightful than <ref target="people.html#EmilyJervois">Emily
						Jervois</ref>, the young ward of <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, in the beautiful
					and touching simplicity with which he has invested her. Her unconscious love for
					her guardian, arising so naturally, as she advances towards womanhood, from her
					grateful affection and unbounded esteem for him, her ingenuous shame at the bad
					conduct of her dissolute mother, and her generosity to that mother on the first
					symptoms of reformation, together with the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>naivet&#233;</hi> which is so happily hit off both in her ideas and her
					language, render her uncommonly interesting. Mrs. Shirley is a graceful portrait
					of mild and venerable age. Lady Beauchamp&apos;s character gives <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> an opportunity to
					shew the address and dexterous management of a man of the world; Olivia, his
					virtuous forbearance; the proud Porretta family, his manly spirit, tempered with
					presence of mind and a guarded prudence; <milestone n="f 3" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="cxxvi"/> the behaviour of Mr. Lowther, and the French surgeons,
					shew a knowledge of professional character; and various parts of the work attest
					the author&apos;s improvement in general information, and more enlarged views of
					life. </p>
				<p> There is not, in any of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref>&apos;s works, one of those detached episodes, thrown in
					like make-weights, to increase the bulk of the volume, which are so common in
					other works: such is the story of <hi rendition="#italics">The Man of the
						Hill</hi>, in <title>Tom Jones</title>. If his works are laboured into
					length, at least his prolixity is all bestowed upon the subject, and increases
					the effect of the story. Flashes of humour, and transient touches of
					sensibility, shew, indeed, genius; but patient and persevering labour alone can
					finish a plan, and make every part bear properly upon the main subject. </p>
				<p>
					<title>Sir Charles Grandison</title>, however, lies open, as what work does not?
					to criticism. Besides the double love, which has been mentioned, there was
					another point which <pb n="cxxvii"/> perplexed the author much: <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, as a Christian,
					was not to fight a duel, yet he was to be recognised as the finished gentleman,
					and could not be allowed to want that most essential part of the character, the
					deportment of a man of honour, courage, and spirit. And, in order to exhibit his
					spirit and courage, it was necessary to bring them into action by adventures and
					rencounters. His first appearance is in the rescue of <ref
						target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>, a meritorious action,
					but one which must necessarily expose him to a challenge. How must the author
					untie this knot? He makes him so very good a swordsman, that he is always
					capable of disarming his adversary without endangering either of their lives.
					But are a man&apos;s principles to depend on the science of his fencing-master?
					Every one cannot have the skill of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison"
						>Sir Charles</ref>; every one cannot be the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>best</hi> swordsman; and the man whose study it is to avoid fighting, is
					not quite so likely <milestone n="f 4" unit="signature"/><pb n="cxxviii"/> as
					another to be the best. <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>,
					indeed, complimented the author upon his success in this nice point, in a
					flourishing epigram, which is thus expressed: <quote><lg type="stanza">
							<l>What hast thou done? I&apos;m ravished at the scene; </l>
							<l>A sword undrawn, makes mighty Caesars mean.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
										place="foot">Unidentified except by secondary
										anecdote.</note></hi></l>
						</lg></quote>But, in fact, it was not undrawn. In the affair with Sir
					Hargrave, he may be said to have really fought a duel; for, though he refuses
					the challenge in words, he virtually accepts it, by going into the garden with
					him, knowing his purpose. In like manner he with Greville retires to a private
					spot, and there, on his adversary&apos;s drawing, which he might be sure he
					would do, draws, disarms, and gives him his life. But Greville might not have
					given him his, nor could everyone turn a duel into such harmless play. Can,
					then, a better expedient be suggested? If not, must we not fairly confess that,
					in certain cases, the code of the gospel and the code of worldly honour <pb
						n="cxxix"/> are irreconcileable [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>], and
					that a man has only to make his choice which he will give up. </p>
				<p> Another fault is, a certain stiffness which, it can hardly be denied, is spread
					over this admirable character. This results partly from the author&apos;s stile,
					which, where it aims to be elegant, wants ease; partly from the manner in which
					the hero is <hi rendition="#italics">pron&#233;</hi>, as the French say, by all
					the other characters, and from the abundance of compliments which are paid on
					all sides; for certainly <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is <hi rendition="#italics">de la vieille cour</hi>.<hi
						rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">&quot;of the old court&quot;; a
							gentleman in the old-fashioned, courtly style. In context, the adjective
							pron&#233; (above), appears to indicate that the hero is held in high
							esteem by others, the model of what is best; he is revered as the
							ultimate reference. </note></hi> In part, too, it arises from the very
					circumstance of his being so perfect and so successful. Perfection of character,
					joined to distress, will interest; but prosperous perfection does not greatly
					engage our sympathy. We are apt to conceive of <ref
						target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> as having, in
					reality, no passions; and we do not greatly pity him for the loss of <ref
						target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, when a most amiable lady,
					who had the other half <milestone n="f 5" unit="signature"/><pb n="cxxx"/> of
					his heart, was waiting his acceptance on the other side of the water. We are not
					quite satisfied with the dutiful resignation with which he gives up
					corresponding with two amiable and beloved sisters, in compliance with the
					injunctions of a tyrannical father. We are the less surprised, however, as we
					recognize in it the high notions entertained by the author of parental
					authority; but we can give no answer to the question, How came so dutiful a son
					to enter into a treaty of marriage without consulting his father? except, what
					perhaps is sufficient, that it would have embarrassed the story. </p>
				<p> There is one important particular in which this highly-wrought character does
					not present an example for imitation, and that is his going so far into a
					matrimonial treaty with a bigotted catholic; with a woman, whose very love for
					him must expose him to continual distressing importunities to change his
					religion. Italian ser- <pb n="cxxxi"/> vants, an Italian confessor, a stipulated
					residence half the year out of his native country, and, above all, the giving up
					half his children (it might happen to be all) to the errors of a faith which he
					believed to be erroneous&#8212;these are among the sacrifices which a
					conscientious man will scruple, and a wise man will refuse to make. Horrible
					must be a union, where the most tender affection can only serve to lacerate the
					heart, as must be the case, when the object of it is supposed to be under the
					wrath of God, and doomed to everlasting perdition. This must be the consequence
					of marrying a bigot to any mode of faith, where the other party is of a
					different one. Add to this, that the very proposal, made so often by the proud
					Porretta family to <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref>, to change his religion for a wife, and bind himself to live
					half the year out of his native county, was a high insult to him, considered
					only as an English gentleman. The author, however, valued himself upon his
					management of this nice <milestone n="f 6" unit="signature"/><pb n="cxxxii"/>
					negociation; and, in a letter to one of his French translators; dexterously
					brings it forward, as a proof of his candour and liberality towards the catholic
						religion.<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">It is said, that an Italian
							translation of the bible appeared some years since at Naples, in the
							preface to which the translator warned his readers against English
							publications; but excepted one, the <title>Clarissa</title> of <ref

				</p>
				<p> The author of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>
					often mentions in his letters, that he was importuned by many of his friends, to
					give them another volume, and the Gottenburg translators sent for the rest of
					the work, supposing it incomplete: he ought to have received it as a proof that
					it was too long, and not too short. He had already continued it a whole volume
					beyond the proper termination, the marriage of his hero, and having done so, he
					might, without more impropriety, have gone on to the next point of view, and the
					next, till he had given the history of two or three generations.
						<title>Clarissa</title>, perhaps, runs out into <pb n="cxxxiii"/> too great
					a length, but bold were the hand that should attempt to shorten it. <title>Sir
						Charles</title>, on the contrary, would be improved by merely striking out
					the last volume, and, indeed, a good part of the sixth, where descriptions of
					dress, and parade, and furniture, after the interest is completely over, like
					the gaudy colouring of a western sky, gives symptoms of a setting sun. But it is
					ungrateful to dwell on the faults of genius. </p>
				<p> Besides his three great works, <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> gave to the world a volume of <hi rendition="#italics"
							><title>Familiar Letters</title>; A paper in the <title>Rambler</title>;
						An edition of <title>Æsop&apos;s Fables, with Reflections</title>;</hi> and
					he was concerned in a few booksellers publications. The <title>Familiar
						Letters</title> is the book he laid by to write <title>Pamela</title>, and
					which he finished as soon as he had done with that work. He did not give his
					name to it. It is seldom found any where but in the servant&apos;s drawer, where
					it is a favourite book, but when so found, it has not unfrequently detained the
					eye of the <pb n="cxxxiv"/> mistress, wondering all the while by what secret
					charm she was induced to turn over a book, apparently too low for her perusal;
					and that charm was&#8212;<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref>. This book shews him intent, as he always was, to
					inculcate the duties of life, and it shews how accurately he had attended to the
					various circumstances and relations of it. The <title>Rambler</title> he wrote
					was the ninety-fifth number:<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><hi
								rendition="#italics"><title>Rambler</title></hi> No. 95 (Tuesday,
							February 12, 1751). The essay is signed &quot;Pertinax.&quot;
						</note></hi> it describes the progress of a virtuous courtship, and pleased
					the public so much, that it is said to be the only paper which experienced a
					great demand, while the work was publishing in numbers. <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was a sincere friend
					of Dr. <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Johnson</ref>&apos;s, and
					interested himself much for the success of the <title>Rambler</title>, which,
					before the papers were collected in volumes, went off but heavily. He also
					published a large single sheet of the <title>Duties of Wives to
					Husbands</title>, and a <title>Selection of Maxims and Moral Sentiments</title>,
					extracted from his three novels, for he always valued himself upon the morality
					of <pb n="cxxxv"/> his pieces, much more than upon his invention, and had partly
					persuaded himself, and partly been flattered by others, into the idea, that he
					was the great reformer of the age. An excellent moral writer he certainly was,
					because his pathetic powers interested the feelings in the cause of virtue; but
					as he did not possess that kind of style, either of terseness or dignity, which
					is necessary to give brilliancy to moral maxims and observations taken
					separately, it was a vain expectation that his should attract attention, when
					they were abstracted from all that had rendered them impressive. Yet he
					certainly did seem to expect, that this little volume would be used by his
					admirers as a kind of manual of morality. </p>
				<p> The style of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, which
					it remains to take notice of, was not in proportion to his other excellencies of
					composition. He wrote with facility; expressions, as well as thoughts, flowing
					readily to his pen; but we do not find in his writ- <pb n="cxxxvi"/> ings,
					either the ease and elegance of good company, or the polished period of a
					finished author. They are not only overloaded with a redundance of complimentary
					expression, which gives a stiffness to the dialogue, particularly in his
						<title>Grandison</title>, where he has most attempted to give a picture of
					genteel life, but they are blemished with little flippancies of expression, new
					coined words, and sentences involved and ill-constructed. One of his
					correspondents, a <ref target="people.html#ReadJohn">Mr. Read</ref>, after
					giving him high and just praise, thus expresses himself: &quot;But is there not
					here and there a nursery phrase, an ill-invented uncouth compound; a
					parenthesis, which interrupts, not assists, the sense? If I am wrong, impute it
					to the rudeness of a college-man, who has had too little commerce with the
					world, to be a judge of its language.&quot; If this was considered to be the
					case when <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> wrote, it
					is a still greater impediment to his fame at <pb n="cxxxvii"/> present, when we
					are become more fastidious with regard to style, in proportion as good writing
					is become more common; that degree, I mean, of good writing, which a habit of
					the pen will always give. The style of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, however, has the
					property of setting before the reader, in the most lively manner, every
					circumstance of what he means to describe. He has the accuracy and finish of a
					Dutch painter, with the fine ideas of an Italian one. He is content to produce
					effects by the patient labour of minuteness. Had he turned his thoughts to an
					observation of rural nature, instead of human manners, he would have been as
					accurate a describer as <ref target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>:
					how circumstantial is the following description of a bird new caught!
					<quote><p rendition="#pnoindent">Hast thou not observed how, at first, refusing all sustenance, it

						fly about, and overspread its well secured cage. Now it gets out its head,
							<pb n="cxxxviii"/> sticking only at its beautiful shoulders; then, with
						difficulty, drawing back its head, it gasps for breath, and erectly perched,

						it gets breath, with renewed rage, it beats and bruises again its pretty
						head and sides, bites the wires, and pecks at the fingers of its delighted

						breathless, it lays itself down, and pants at the bottom of the cage,
						seeming to bemoan its cruel fate, and forfeited liberty. And, after a few
						days, its struggles to escape still diminishing, as it finds it to no

				<p> An idea prevailed at the time, and has gained credit with many, that <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
					<pb n="cxxxix"/> was assisted in his works, particularly his
						<title>Grandison</title>, by some of his lady correspondents. It is true
					that he often complimented them, by asking their advice and assistance, and was
					so far at least in earnest in the request, that, being very sensible of his
					deficiencies in his knowledge of fashionable life, he hoped to be benefited by
					their hints and criticisms. How should he draw a fine gentleman, he often asks,
					except they would condescend to tell him what sort of a man he must be to
					please. <ref target="people.html#LadyG">Lady G.</ref>&apos;s letters, in
					particular, were said to he written by <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref>; but the
					author&apos;s own words, in a letter to that lady, are a sufficient confutation
					of the report, at the same time that they mention a trifling insertion from
					another lady; but, it should be observed, a mere insertion, and not at all
					connected with the story of the novel. <quote><p rendition="#pnoindent">Your ladyship has been forced to

				<p> The works of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> bear
					all the internal marks of having been written by one person. The same
					sentiments, the same phraseology, the same plan sedulously followed from
					beginning to end, <pb n="cxli"/> proclaim the hand of a single author. It is
					true, indeed, that when his female friends pressed him to give them another
					volume of <title>Sir Charles</title>, he told them, that in that case they must
					each contribute. Whether he had really any serious design in what he said,
					cannot now be known, but <ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady
						Bradshaigh</ref> seems to have been the only one who complied. She wrote one
					letter, in the character of <ref target="people.html#LadyG">Lady G.</ref> It is
					executed with a degree of liveliness and spirit, and not unsuitable to the
					character she had engaged to support, but it is evident from <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&apos;s answer, that
					he did not like it well enough to have made use of it, had the intended volume
					taken place. But where could <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> have found a pen able to supply his own, except in some

									><title>Poems on Several Occasions</title></hi>
						(1762).</note></hi> made its first appearance in <title>Clarissa</title>,
					but indeed, without the author&apos;s permission. There is a fragment among <pb
						n="cxlii"/> the unprinted correspondence, by the famous <ref
						target="people.html#Psalmanazar">Psalmanazer</ref>, written for the purpose
					of being inserted in <title>Pamela</title>, in the second part. It is an account
					of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>&apos;s charities to a
					poor family: but it is coarsely written; attempting to move the heart by a mere
					representation of squalid misery, (a representation easy to execute) without a
					spark of the grace and delicacy which is necessary to touch the finer feelings:
					it was very properly laid aside. The fragment, entitled, the <hi
						rendition="#italics"><title>History of Mrs. Beaumont</title></hi>, printed
					at the end of volume the fifth of this publication, was possibly meant for this
					additional volume; or, it may be, thrown out of the former ones, as what might
					be spared without injuring the general effect, for <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> shortened
					considerably all his works, voluminous as they are. <title>Clarissa</title> was
					reduced by two whole volumes after the first draught of it. He had never
					occasion to solicit his invention, his only care was to rein it in: a strong
					characte- <pb n="cxliii"/> ristic of true genius. <title>Clarissa</title>
					underwent the criticism of <ref target="people.html#CibberColley">Colley
						Cibber</ref>, <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>, and
						<ref target="people.html#HillAaron">Aaron Hill</ref>. The latter undertook
					to go through it, and write the whole again more briefly: he wrote over again
					the first seven letters, but he soon found he should take a great deal of pains
					only to spoil it, and the author found it still sooner than he did. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>, sensible of the arduous
					task his friend would have, to support the reputation he had gained by this
					work, had advised him to repose upon his laurels: but, when his
						<title>Grandison</title> was published, he retracted, in the following
					couplet: <quote><lg type="stanza">
							<l>I now applaud, what I presum&apos;d to blame, </l>
							<l><hi rendition="#italics">After</hi>&#160;<title>Clarissa</title> you

						</lg></quote></p>
				<p> That he rose in fame by it, is very true; not, however, in the general opinion,
					by the last surpassing the former, but by the accession it brought to what he
					had already performed. He himself used to say, <pb n="cxliv"/> that he looked
					upon himself as the father of three daughters, all of whom he loved with so much
					tenderness, that he enjoyed the praises of all equally, and it was indifferent
					to him, whether the elder or the younger were thought the handsomest. A lady,
					indeed, told him, that they put her in mind of a story she had heard from her
					nurse, of a man who had three daughters, the first was the handsomest that ever
					was, the second was handsomer than she, and the third was the handsomest of all. </p>
				<p> His <title>Grandison</title> was published in 1753. While it was in the press,
					an affair happened which gave him great disgust and vexation, and considerably
					injured his well-earned property. This was the piracy of the Dublin booksellers.
					The printing Irish editions from published books, however it might prejudice an
					author, was not forbid by any law, though it was illegal to vend them in
					England. But, at least, the author&apos;s edition had so much the start <pb
						n="cxlv"/> of any other, as made it worth-while for a Dublin bookseller to
					purchase his concurrence. But these men bribed the servants of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> to steal the sheets
					while they were under the press. They broke open the place where they were kept,
					as he says, under lock and key; sent over what was prepared for publication,
					which was about half the work, and came out with a cheap edition of several of
					the volumes, before the author&apos;s English one; and almost all the Dublin
					booksellers concurred in this atrocious act of robbery. <ref
						target="people.html#FaulknerGeorge">Faulkner</ref>, who was the
					author&apos;s agent for his own edition, seems to have acted like the dog in the
					story, who, being set to defend a basket of meat, his master&apos;s property,
					which was attacked by a number of other dogs, kept them off for some time with
					great vigilance, but finding that one snatched a piece, and another snatched a
					piece, abandoned the defence; and, since he could not keep off the depredators,
					resolved to come in for <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"><hi
							rendition="#smcaps">vol. i.</hi></fw><milestone n="g" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="cxlvi"/> his share. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> sent his own edition to be sold there at a reduced price,
					but they were resolved to undersell him, and for what he did sell he could not
					get the money. His friends in Dublin expressed great indignation at the
					behaviour of their countrymen, and endeavoured to serve him in the matter. Many
					letters passed, but to little purpose. This affair seems to have vexed <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> to the heart. His
					reputation was at the highest, the sale of his works sure, and he reasonably
					expected to reap the profit of it. Notwithstanding, however, those
					disappointments which people in business are liable to meet with, <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>&apos;s assiduity
					and success was gradually encreasing his fortune. In the year 1755 he was
					engaged in building, both in town and in the country. In the country he removed
					from North End to Parsons Green, where he fitted up a house. In town, he took a
						<pb n="cxlvii"/> range of old houses, eight in number, which he pulled down,
					and built an extensive and commodious range of warehouses and printing-offices.
					It was still in Salisbury-court, in the north-west corner, and it is at present
					concealed by other houses from common observation. The dwelling-house, it seems,
					was neither so large nor so airy as the one he quitted; and, therefore, the
					reader will not be so ready, probably, as <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> seems to have
					been, in accusing his wife of perverseness, in not liking the new habitation so
					well as the old. &quot;Every body (he says) is more pleased with what I have
					done, than my wife.&quot; Two years after, he married his daughter <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonMarydaughter">Mary</ref> (the only one married
					in his life-time) to Mr. Ditcher, a respectable surgeon at Bath. He now allowed
					himself some relaxation from business; and only attended from time to time, his
					printing-offices in London. He often regretted, <milestone n="g 2"
						unit="signature"/><pb n="cxlviii"/> that he had only females to whom to
					transfer his business; however, he had taken in to assist him a nephew, who
					relieved him from the more burdensome cares of it, and who eventually succeeded
					him. He now had leisure, had he had health, to enjoy his reputation, his
					prosperous circumstances, his children, and his friends; but, alas! leisure
					purchased by severe application, often comes too late to be enjoyed; and, in a
					worldly, as well as in a religious sense, <quote><lg type="stanza">
							<l>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;When we find</l>
							<l>The key of life, it opens to the grave. </l>
						</lg></quote></p>
				<p> His nervous disorders increased upon him, and his valuable life was at length
					terminated by a stroke of an apoplexy, on the 4th of July, 1761, at the age of
					seventy-two. He was buried, by his own direction, near <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonMarthawife">his first wife</ref>, in the
					middle aisle, near the pulpit of St. Bride&apos;s church. </p>
				<p> The moral character of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
						Richardson</ref> may be partly gathered from the preceding <pb n="cxlix"/>
					sketch of his life. It was most respectable and worthy of his genius. He was
					sober and temperate, regular and assiduous in business, of high integrity, and
					undoubted honour. It is no small praise, that in his unfriended youth, and in
					the midst of those miscellaneous connections which a man who acts in the world
					unavoidably forms, (and of intercourse with the gay and the dissolute, the <ref
						target="people.html#CibberColley">Cibber</ref>s and <ref
						target="people.html#WhartonPhilip">Wharton</ref>s of the time, he had his
					share) that, so circumstanced, he should have firmness of mind to resist the
					temptations which offer themselves in a licentious metropolis, and should be
					able to say thus of himself, &quot;I never was in a bad house, nor, to my
					knowledge, in company with a licentious woman in my life.&quot; This assertion
					was drawn from him by his friend <ref target="people.html#StinstraJohannes">Mr.
						Stinstra</ref>, who had insinuated, that in order to draw a <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, it was necessary he should
					have been something of a libertine at one period or other of his life. His
					admirers, however, are <milestone n="g 3" unit="signature"/><pb n="cl"/>
					constrained to acknowledge, that his imagination was not quite so pure as his
					conduct. He seems, by some means or other, to have acquired a most formidable
					idea of the snares to which young women are exposed, and of their incapacity (in
					general) to resist them. He seemed to think women had a great deal to hide, and
					though his chief intimacies were with ladies, he sometimes betrays a mean
					opinion of the sex in general. Perhaps we might find the origin of some of these
					ideas, if we were in possession of the love letters he wrote for his female
					companions, in the early period of his life, with their dangers and escapes;
					but, it is certain his writings rather tend to inspire a certain bashful
					consciousness, and shrinking reserve, than the noble simplicity of truth and
					nature, in the intercourse between the sexes. <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was a careful, kind
					father, and a good husband in essentials; but, it must be confessed, there
					appears to have been a certain for- <pb n="cli"/> mality and stiffness of
					manner, but ill calculated to invite his children to that familiarity and
					confidence, which is so lovely when it does take place, but which frequently
					fails to do so, even where there is real affection, between such relations. Of
					this he was himself sufficiently sensible, and often laments it. &quot;My
					girls,&quot; says he, &quot;are shy little fools.&quot; But manner does not
					depend on the will. The manner of a bashful, reserved man, is seldom encouraging
					to others; especially if he stands in a superior relation to them. Besides, he
					not only had high notions of filial as well as conjugal obedience, but expected
					all those reverential demonstrations of it in the outward behaviour, which are
					now, whether wisely or not I will not pretend to determine, so generally laid
					aside. <ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> writes
					him a very sensible letter on this subject. She finds fault with the stile of
					his daughter&apos;s letters, as too stiff, with the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>Honoured Sir</hi>, and the <hi rendition="#italics">ever dutiful</hi>,
					constantly occurring, which, she tells him, <milestone n="g 4" unit="signature"
						/><pb n="clii"/> was not likely to produce the familiarity he wished to
					invite; and objects, that in his writings, filial awe is too much inculcated. In
					his answer he acknowledges the too great distance of his own children; but as to
					the general maxim observes, &quot;I had rather (as too much reverence is not the
					vice of the age) lay down rules that should stiffen into apparent duty, than
					make the pert rogues too familiar with characters so reverend;&quot; and adds,
					&quot;I could wish, from the respectful manner (avoiding formality and stiffness
					as much as possible) in letters to a parent, let my eye fall on what part of the
					letter it would, to be able to distinguish it from one directed to a
					playmate.&quot; To young children <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> was familiarly kind, and they were very fond of him; he
					generally carried sugar-plumbs in his pocket to make his court to them. It must
					also be observed, that one lady who knew him personally, imputes the formality
					of the fa- <pb n="cliii"/> mily rather to <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">Mrs. Richardson</ref> than to
					him. She was, by all accounts, a formal woman, but with a very kind heart.
					&quot;My worthy-hearted wife,&quot; her husband generally calls her, and, no

					complain of being governed by his meek wife. &quot;What meek woman,&quot; says
					he, &quot;ever gave up a point that she had fixed her heart upon? O the sweet
					Parthians!&quot; And, in another letter, <quote>My wife, a very good woman, in
						the main, as I have often said, governs me thus; She lets me bear my
						testimony against what I dislike. I do it, now-and-then, as I think reason
						calls, with some vehemence: she hears me out. A day or two after, (if it be
						a point she has her heart in, or her will, which to a woman is the same
						thing) with- <milestone n="g 5" unit="signature"/><pb n="cliv"/> out varying
						much either lights or shades, she brings the matter once more on the tapis.
						I have exhausted all my reasonings, cannot bear to repeat what I had said
						before, and she carries her point; and, what is the worst of it, judging by
						her success, thinks me convinced, and that she was right at first, and I was
						wrong; and so prepares to carry the next. </quote>In this kind of half
					captious pleasantry, his conversation, as well as his letters, abounded. He was
					a benevolent and kind-hearted, but I do not feel sure that he was a
					good-humoured, man. For liberality, generosity, and charity, <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> claims unqualified
					praise. His generosity knew no bounds, but the necessary attention to the
					welfare of a growing family. Various incidents in the numerous volumes of his
					letters, both those which appear, and the far greater part which do not appear,
					shew how much he was in the habit of obliging. He assisted <ref
						target="people.html#HillAaron">Aaron Hill</ref> with money; he <pb n="clv"/>
					had the honour to bail <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr.
					Johnson</ref>. He writes to a neighbour, who had suffered from a fire, and with
					whom he does not appear to have been in habits of intimacy, offering the use of
					all his first floor for a week, fortnight, month, or as long as he should be
					unprovided; and the attendance of his servants for himself and family, and an
					occasional bed at his country residence, and all this he presses upon him with
					the most generous earnestness. In all these kindnesses his wife concurred with
					affectionate readiness. <ref target="people.html#CollierJane">Miss
					Collier</ref>, it is evident, was in the habit of receiving pecuniary assistance
					from him. The unhappy <ref target="people.html#PilkingtonLaetitia">Mrs.
						Pilkington</ref> found a friend in him. When <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> mentioned the
					case of the poor penitent girl, for whom she wanted a situation: &quot;Let her
					come to us,&quot; he said, &quot;she shall do just what she can, and stay till
					she is otherwise provided for.&quot; He was a great promoter, if not the first
					mover, of the Magdalen charity. In short, his purse <milestone n="g 6"
						unit="signature"/><pb n="clvi"/> was ever open to any proper call upon it,
					not to mention the many opportunities a man in business has, of doing essential
					favours without any actual donation. Besides all this, he had a brother&apos;s
					family thrown, in a great measure, upon his hands. He thus writes of the event
					in 1750: &quot;It is a brother&apos;s death I mourn for; an honest, a
					good-natured, but a careless man; of late years careless, so that his affairs
					were embarrassed, and he has left six children, five of them small and
					helpless.&quot; In the affairs of a family difference, in which he was the
					mediator, his advice seems to have been prudent, conciliating, and judicious.
					His advice and opinion was greatly valued by all his friends, both literary and
					others, and his trouble, as a printer, was enhanced by the criticisms and
					remarks they engaged him to make, on the pieces they entrusted him with. </p>
				<p> In the qualities of courtesy and hospitality, <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was excelled by no
					man. <pb n="clvii"/> &quot;I think I see you,&quot; says one of his
					correspondents, &quot;sitting at your door like an old patriarch, and inviting
					all who pass by to come in.&quot; Whether sick or well; whether they could
					entertain him with vivacity and chearfulness, or wanted themselves the soothing
					and attentions of himself and family, they were always welcome. Two of his
					friends were nursed at his house in their last illness. In all the intercourses
					of civility he loved to be the obliger, especially if his friends were of rank
					and fortune superior to his own. His letters, particularly to <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref>, are full of
					contests about little presents, which he loved better to give than to receive.
					In this there was, no doubt, a jealous fear of being treated otherwise than as
					an equal, and somewhat of a painful consciousness of inferiority of station
					prompting that fear; for he possessed the dignity of an independent mind. When
						<ref target="people.html#EchlinElizabeth">Lady Echlin</ref> expressed her
					wishes that he might be ac-<pb n="clviii"/>quainted with her daughter, <ref
						target="people.html#PalmerElizabeth">Mrs. Palmer</ref>, a lady of fashion;
					&quot;the advances, then,&quot; said he, &quot;must come from her. She was the
					superior in rank, but he knew ladies of the west-end of the town did not wish to
					pass Temple-bar;&quot; and, sometimes, perhaps, this consciousness made him a
					little captious with regard to the attentions he expected from ladies of
					fashion; who, coming to town for a short period, could not devote so much time
					to him, as, perhaps, the warm affection expressed in their correspondence, might
					have led him to expect. </p>
				<p> It will not be supposed that a man who knew so well how to paint the passion of
					love, should be inaccessible to its influence. His matrimonial connections were,
					most probably, those of convenience and calm affection; but he intimates that he
					once loved with ardour. The passage referred to is in a letter to <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref>, who had been
					desiring him to write, for his <pb n="clix"/> next publication, the history of
					his own life. </p>
				<quote>

					<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> was a friend to
					mental improvement in women, though under all those restrictions which modesty
					and decorum have imposed upon the sex. Indeed, his sentiments seem to have been
					more favourable to female literature, before than after his intercourse with the
					fashionable world; for <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>
					has been taught Latin, but <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss
						Byron</ref> is made to say, that she does not even know which are meant by
					the learned languages, and to declare, that a woman who knows them is an owl
					among the birds. The prejudice against any appearance of extraordinary
					cultivation in women, was, at that period, very strong. It will scarcely be
					believed, <pb n="clxiv"/> by this generation, that <ref
						target="people.html#DelanyMrs">Mrs. Delany</ref>, the accomplished <ref
						target="people.html#DelanyMrs">Mrs. Delany</ref>, objects to the words <hi
						rendition="#italics">intellect</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics"
					>ethics</hi>, in one of the conversation pieces, in <title>Grandison</title>, as
					too scholastic to proceed from the mouth of a female. What would some of these
					critics have said, could they have heard young ladies talking of gases, and
					nitrous oxyd, and stimuli, and excitability, and all the terms of modern
					science. The restraint of former times was painful and humiliating; what can be
					more humiliating than the necessity of affecting ignorance? and yet, perhaps, it
					is not undesirable that female genius should have something to overcome; so
					much, as to render it probable, before a woman steps out of the common walks of
					life, that her acquirements are solid, and her love for literature decided and
					irresistible. These obstacles did not prevent the <title>Epictetus</title> of
						<ref target="people.html#CarterElizabeth">Mrs. Carter</ref>, nor the volumes
					of <ref target="people.html#ChaponeMrs">Mrs. Chapone</ref>, from being written
					and given to the world.<pb n="clxv"/></p>
				<p> The moral qualities of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> were crowned with a serious and warm regard for religion;
					it is conspicuous in all his works; and we shall, probably, not find any
					writings, of the class of novels, in which virtue and piety are so strongly and
					uniformly recommended, without any party spirit, or view to recommend a
					particular system, and it would be doing injustice to the taste of the world not
					to say that they were highly valued on that account. The house of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was a school of
					virtuous sentiment and good morals. The following letter, from <ref
						target="people.html#ReichErasmus">Mr. Reich</ref>, of Leipsic, shews the
					pleasing impression a visit to him made on the lively feelings of a foreigner. </p>
				<quote>
					<p> You know, Sir, I set out for England purely with a view of cultivating a
						personal acquaintance with so great a man as <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Samuel Richardson</ref>, who
						had so long endeared himself to me by his works, and who, afterwards, by the
						corres- <pb n="clxvi"/> pondence established between us, granted me his
						friendship. I arrived at London the eighth of August, and had not much
						difficulty in finding <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
							Richardson</ref> in this great city. He gave me a reception worthy of
						the author of <title>Pamela</title>, <title>Clarissa</title>, and
							<title>Grandison</title>; that is, with the same heart which appears
						throughout his works. His person, his family, and even his domestics, all
						answer this character. He carried me into his library, and his
						printing-house, (for he is a printer), in both which I never saw things so
						well disposed. Sunday following, I was with him at his country-house,
						(Selby-house) where his family was, with some ladies, acquaintances of his
						four daughters, who, with his lady, compose his family. It was there I saw
						beauties without affectation; wit without vanity; and thought myself
						transported to an inchanted land. After chocolate, <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> brought <pb
							n="clxvii"/> us into the garden, adjoining to the house. He invited me
						to partake of its fruits, of which the trees afforded the finest of their
						kind; and, perceiving that I hesitated, gathered some himself, which he
						presented to me. Every thing I saw, every thing I tasted, recalled to me the
						idea of the golden age. Here are to be seen no counterfeits, such as are the
						offspring of vanity, and the delight of fools. A noble simplicity reigns
						throughout, and elevates the soul. The harmony of this charming family
						furnished me with many reflections on the common ill-judged methods of
						education, whence springs the source either of our happiness or misery. The
						ladies affected not that stiff preciseness peculiar to coquettes. Trained up
						by a parent who instructs them, still more by his example than by his works,
						they strive to imitate him; and, if you feel a tenderness for objects so
						lovely, you will <pb n="clxviii"/> surely be sensible of a still greater
						respect for them. </p>
					<p> In the middle of the garden, over against the house, we came to a kind of
						grotto, where we rested ourselves. It was on this seat, <ref
							target="people.html#LeFevreJohn">Mr. Le Fevre</ref>, (<ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>&apos;s
						friend) told me, that <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>,
							<ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, and <ref
							target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Grandison</ref>, received their
						birth; I kissed the ink-horn on the side of it. We afterwards proceeded to
						table, (dinner,) where an opportunity was offered me of reading the letters
						written to me by <ref target="people.html#SackAntoinette">Malle. Sack</ref>,
						from Berlin, concerning my voyage, and Mr. <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>. One might in
						them discern that wit which is the peculiar characteristic of that lady;
						and, every one listened with the closest attention to whatever truth obliged
						me to say concerning her. Whereupon <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> observed to
						me, that the ladies in company were all his adopted daughters: that he
						should be very proud <pb n="clxix"/> to give to them, as well as to his own,
						so charming a sister; and desired to signify as much to her, and to send her
						his picture, which he gave me for that purpose. The rest of our discourse
						turned on the merits of <ref target="people.html#GellertChristian">Mr.
							Gellert</ref>, and of some other Germans of distinction. I told him, we
						had the same reason to glory in our relationship, as countrymen of these
						worthy gentlemen, as the English had in regard to him. <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>&apos;s usual
						modesty dictated his answer. Towards evening he brought me to London, where
						he made me promise to come and see him as often as I could. On the Sunday
						following I was with him again at his pleasant country seat. We found there
						a large company, all people of merit; <ref target="people.html#MillerPhilip"
							>Mr. Miller</ref>, author of the <title>Gardener&apos;s
							Dictionary</title>, (which has been translated at Nurnburg, with such
						success), and <ref target="people.html#HighmoreJoseph">Mr. Highmore</ref>,
						the famous painter, <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"><hi
								rendition="#smcaps">vol. i.</hi></fw><milestone n="h"
							unit="signature"/><pb n="clxx"/> were there. This last, two days
						afterwards, conferred on me a genteel piece of civility, which I shall never
						forget: he must, indeed, be the accomplished gentleman he appears to be, by
						obliging with so good a grace. I was extremely concerned on not seeing his
						only daughter, who was in the country. I have read some of her letters,
						which excite in me the highest esteem both for her understanding and her
						heart. In the evening I took my leave of the family, and returned with <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>. I saw him
						several times since, during the eight days I staid in England; but it was
						necessary, at last, to quit that divine man. I gave him the letter entitled
						No. I. he embraced me, and a mutual tenderness deprived us of speech. He
						accompanied me with his eyes as far as he could: I shed tears. </p>

				<p> It may be observed upon this, that the ladies he associated with were well able
					to appreciate his works. They were both his critics and his models, and from
					their sprightly conversation, and the disquisitions on love and sentiment, which
					took place, he gathered what was more to his purpose than graver topics would
					have produced. He was not writing a dictionary, like <ref
						target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Johnson</ref>, or a history, like <ref
						target="people.html#GibbonEdward">Gibbon</ref>. He was a novel writer; his
					business was not only with the human heart, but with the female heart. <pb

				</p>
				<p>No man sought criticism with more diligence, or received it with more candour,
					than <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>; he asks it
					even from some who had little title to give it. The fault of his mind was,
					rather that he was too much occupied with himself, than that he had too high an
					opinion of his talents. Praise, however, he certainly loved, and all that
					remains to be said on this head is, that when a man of genius is humane,
					benevolent, temperate, and pious, we may allow in him a little shade of vanity,
					as a tribute to human weakness. As to the vails, it was a disgraceful
					circumstance, not to <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
					>Richardson</ref>, but to the customs of our country, and to <ref
						target="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr. Onslow</ref>, if he could not make his
					servants pay respect to his guests without it. But it were as candid to account
					for <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&apos;s giving
					more than others, from his known generosity as from his desire of distinction. I
					cannot pass by in silence, though it is unpleasant to advert to, the
					contemptuous manner in which <milestone n="h 3" unit="signature"/><pb n="clxxiv"/>
					<ref target="people.html#MontaguMaryWortley">Lady Wortley Montagu</ref> has

					and character, as to the merit and respectable situation in life of the person
					she speaks of. &quot;The doors of the great,&quot; she says, &quot;were never
					opened to him.&quot; If the doors of the great were never opened to a genius
					whom every Englishman ought to have been proud of, if they were either tasteless
					of his merit, or so selfishly appreciated it as to be content to be entertained
					and instructed by his writings in their closet, and to suffer the man to want
					that notice and regard which is the proper and deserved reward of distinguished
					talent,&#8212;upon them let the disgrace rest, and not upon <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>. And, I believe it is
					true, that in England genius and learning obtain less personal notice than in
					most other parts of Europe, and that men are classed here more by similiarity of
					fortune than by any other circumstance. Still, how- <pb n="clxxv"/> ever, they
					do attract notice; and the reader must be amply convinced, by the list of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>&apos;s friends and
					correspondents, that <ref target="people.html#MontaguMaryWortley">Lady
						Wortley</ref>&apos;s assertions are as untrue as illiberal. It is strange
					that she, whose talents, not her rank, have transmitted her name to posterity,
					should not have experienced a more kindly fellow-feeling towards talent: but the
					public will judge which was most estimable, she whose conduct banished her from
					those with whom her birth entitled her to associate, or he who, by his merit,
					raised himself above the class whence he drew his humble origin. </p>
				<p> I omitted to mention, in its proper place, that <ref

					below the middle stature, and inclined to corpulency; of a round, rather than
					oval, face, with a fair ruddy complexion. His features, says one, who speaks
					from recollection, bore the stamp of good nature, and were characteristic of his
					placid and amiable disposition. He was slow in speech, and, to strangers at
					least, spoke with reserve and deliberation; but, in his manners, was affable,
					courteous, and engaging, and when surrounded with the social circle he loved to
					draw around him, his eye sparkled with pleasure, and often expressed that
					particular spirit of archness which we see in some of his characters, and which
					gave, at times, a vivacity to his conversation, not expected from his general
					taciturnity and quiet manners. He has left us a characteristic portrait of
					himself, in a letter to <ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady
						Bradshaigh</ref>, written when he was in his sixtieth year, before they had
					seen one <pb n="clxxvii"/> another. She was to find him out by it (as she
					actually did,) as he walked in the Park. &quot;Short, rather plump, about five
					feet five inches, fair wig, one hand generally in his bosom, the other a cane in
					it, which he leans upon under the skirts of his coat, that it may imperceptibly
					serve him as a support, when attacked by sudden tremors or dizziness, of a light
					brown complexion, teeth not yet failing him.&quot; What follows is very
					descriptive of the struggle in his character between innate bashfulness and a
					turn for observation. &quot;Looking directly foreright, as passengers would
					imagine, but observing all that stirs on either hand of him, without moving his
					short neck; a regular even pace, stealing away ground rather than seeming to rid
					it; a grey eye, too often overclouded by mistiness from the head, by chance
					lively, very lively if he sees any he loves; if he approaches a lady, his eye is
					never fixed <milestone n="h 5" unit="signature"/><pb n="clxxviii"/> first on her
					face, but on her feet, and rears it up by degrees, seeming to set her down as so
					or so.&quot;</p>
				<p> The health of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was
					grievously affected by those disorders which pass under the denomination of
					nervous, and are the usual consequence of bad air, confinement, sedentary
					employment, and the wear and tear of the mental faculties. It is astonishing how
					a man who had to raise his fortune by the slow process of his own industry, to
					take care of an extensive business, to educate his own family, and to be a
					father to many of his relations, could find time in the breaks and pauses of his
					other avocations, for works so considerable in size as well as in merit,
					&quot;nineteen close printed volumes,&quot; as he often mentions, when insisting
					upon it, in answer to the instances of his correspondents, that he would write
					more, that he had already written more than enough. Where there exists strong
					ge- <milestone n="3" unit="signature"/><pb n="clxxix"/> nius, the bent of the
					mind is imperious, and will be obeyed: but the body too often sinks under it.
					&quot;I had originally,&quot; (says he) &quot;a good constitution; I hurt it by
					no intemperance, but that of application.&quot;</p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> scarcely writes a
					letter without mentioning those nervous or paralytic tremors, which indeed are
					very observable in those letters written with his own hand, and which obliged
					him often to employ the hand of another. Yet his writing, to the last, was
					small, even, and very legible. Though a strong advocate for public worship, he
					had discontinued, for many years, going to church, on account, as he tells <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady B.</ref> of his not being able
					to bear a crowd. It is probable, however, that he also wanted the relaxation of
					a Sunday spent in the country. He took tar-water, then very much in vogue, and
					lived for seven years upon a vegetable diet; but his best remedy was <milestone
						n="h 6" unit="signature"/><pb n="clxxx"/> probably his country house, and
					the amusement of Tunbridge, which he was accustomed to frequent in the season.
					He never could ride, being, as he declares, quite a cockney, but used a chamber
					horse, one of which he kept at each of his houses. His nervous maladies
					notwithstanding increased, and for years before his death he could not lift the
					quantity of a small glass of wine to his mouth, though put into a tumbler,
					without assistance. He loved to complain, but who that suffers from disorders
					that affect the very springs of life and happiness, does not? Who does not wish
					for the friendly soothings of sympathy, under maladies from which more material
					relief is not to be expected? That sympathy was feelingly expressed by <ref

				<p> In the latter part of his life, he was rarely seen among his workmen, some times
					not twice in a year, and, even when he was in town, gave his directions by
					little notes. His principal workman was hard of hearing; and <ref

				<p> His will shews the same equitable, friendly, and beneficent disposition, which
					was apparent in his life; legacies to a tribe of relations, to whom, it appears,

					possessed &quot;an excellent and cultivated understanding, true piety,
					sensibility, resignation, and strength of mind.&quot; </p>
				<p> His daughter <ref target="people.html#RichardsonMarthadaughter">Martha</ref> was

				<quote>
					<p> I am willing to give you every aid in my power, and contribute my mite of
						praise to my venerated friend.<pb n="clxxxiii"/></p>
					<p>My first recollection of him is in his house in the centre of
						Salisbury-square, or Salisbury-court, as it was then called; and of being
						admitted, as a playful child, into his study, where I have often seen <ref
							target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>, and others; and where
						I was generally caressed, and rewarded with biscuits or <hi
							rendition="#italics">bonbons</hi> of some kind or other, and sometimes
						with books, for which he, and some more of my friends, kindly encouraged a
						taste, even at that early age, which has adhered to me all my life long, and
						continues to be the solace of many a painful hour. I recollect that he used
						to drop in at my father&apos;s, for we lived nearly opposite, late in the
						evening, to supper; when, as he would say, he had worked as long as his eyes
						and nerves would let him, and was come to relax, with a little friendly and
						domestic chat. I even then used to creep to his knee, and hang upon his
						words, for my whole family <pb n="clxxxiv"/> doated on him; and once, I
						recollect, that, at one of these evening visits, probably about the year
						1753, I was standing by his knee, when my mother&apos;s maid came to summon
						me to bed; upon which, being unwilling to part from him, and manifesting
						some reluctance, he begged I might be permitted to stay a little longer;
						and, on my mother&apos;s objecting that the servant would be wanted to wait
						at supper, for, in those days of friendly intercourse and <hi
							rendition="#italics">real</hi> hospitality, a decent maid-servant was
						the only attendant at <hi rendition="#italics">his own</hi>, and many
						creditable tables, where, nevertheless, much company was received, <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> said, &apos;I
						am sure Miss P. is now so much a woman, that she does not want any one to
						attend her to bed, but will conduct herself with so much propriety, and put
						out her own candle so carefully, that she may henceforward be indulged with
						remaining with us till <pb n="clxxxv"/> supper is served.&apos; This hint,
						and the confidence it implied, had such a good effect upon me, that, I
						believe, I never required the attendance of a servant afterwards, while my
						mother lived; and, by such sort of ingenious and gentle devices, did he use
						to encourage and draw in young people to do what was right.&#8212;I also
						well remember the happy days I passed at his house at North End; sometimes
						with my mother, but often, for weeks, without her, domesticated as one of
						his own children. He used to pass the greatest part of the week in town;
						but, when he came down, he used to like to have his family flock around him,
						when we all first asked and received his blessing, together with some small
						boon from his paternal kindness and attention; for, he seldom met us
						empty-handed, and was by nature most generous and liberal. </p>
					<p> The piety, order, decorum, and strict <pb n="clxxxvi"/> regularity, that
						prevailed in his family, were of infinite use to train the mind to good
						habits, and to depend upon its own resources. It has been one of the means
						which, under the blessing of God, has enabled me to dispense with the
						enjoyment of what the world calls pleasures, such as are found in crowds;
						and actually to relish and prefer the calm delights of retirement and books.
						As soon as <ref target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">Mrs.
							Richardson</ref> arose, the beautiful Psalms in <ref
							target="people.html#SmithLawrence">Smith</ref>&apos;s Devotions were
						read responsively in the nursery, by herself, and daughters, standing in a
						circle: only the two eldest were allowed to breakfast with her, and whatever
						company happened to be in the house, for they were seldom without. After
						breakfast we younger ones read to her in turns the Psalms, and lessons for
						the day. We were then permitted to pursue our childish sports, or to walk in
						the garden, which I was allowed <pb n="clxxxvii"/> to do at pleasure; for,
						when my mother hesitated upon granting that privilege, for fear I should
						help myself to the fruit, <ref target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife"
							>Mrs. Richardson</ref> said, &apos;No! I have so much confidence in her,
						that, if she is put upon honour, I am certain that she will not touch so
						much as a gooseberry.&apos; A confidence, I dare safely aver, that I never
						forfeited, and which has given me the power of walking in any garden ever
						since, without the smallest desire to touch any fruit, and taught me a
						lesson upon the restraint of appetite, which has been useful to me all my
						life. We all dined at one table, and generally drank tea and spent the
						evening in <ref target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">Mrs.
							Richardson</ref>&apos;s parlour, where the practice was for one of the
						young ladies to read, while the rest sat with mute attention, round a large
						table, and employed themselves in some kind of needle-work. <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> generally
						retired to his study, unless there was particular company. <pb n="clxxxviii"
						/></p>
					<p>These are childish and trifling anecdotes, and savour, perhaps you may think,
						too much of egotism. They certainly can be of no further use to you, than as
						they mark the extreme benevolence, condescension, and kindness, of this
						exalted genius, towards young people; for, in general society, I know he has
						been accused of being of few words, and of a particularly reserved turn. He
						was, however, all his life-time, the patron and protector of the female sex.
						Miss M. (afterwards <ref target="people.html#GoslingLady">Lady G</ref>.)
						passed many years in his family. She was the bosom friend, and contemporary
						of my mother; and was so much considered as <hi rendition="#italics">enfant
							de famille</hi> in <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
							Richardson</ref>&apos;s house, that her portrait is introduced into a
						family-piece.</p>
					<p> He had many <hi rendition="#italics">proteg&#233;es:</hi>&#8212;A Miss
						Rosine, from Portugal, was consigned to his care; but of her, being then at
						school, I never saw much. Most of the ladies <pb n="clxxxix"/> that resided
						much at his house, acquired a certain degree of fastidiousness and delicate
						refinement, which, though amiable in itself, rather disqualified them from
						appearing in general society, to the advantage that might have been
						expected, and rendered an intercourse with the world uneasy to themselves,
						giving a peculiar air of shiness and reserve to their whole address, of
						which habits his own daughters partook, in a degree that has been thought by
						some, a little to obscure those really valuable qualifications and talents
						they undoubtedly possessed. Yet, this was supposed to be owing more to <ref
							target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">Mrs. Richardson</ref> than
						to him; who, though a truly good woman, had high and Harlowean notions of
						parental authority, and kept the ladies in such order, and at such a
						distance, that he often lamented, as I have been told by my mother, that
						they were not more open and conversable with him. <pb n="cxc"/></p>
					<p>Besides those I have already named, I well remember a <ref
							target="people.html#DonnellanAnne">Mrs. Donellan</ref>, a venerable old
						lady, with sharp-piercing eyes; <ref target="people.html#ChaponeMrs">Miss
							Mulso</ref>, &amp;c. &amp;c. <ref target="people.html#SeckerThomas"
							>Secker</ref>, Archbishop of Canterbury; <ref
							target="people.html#GranthamThomas">Sir Thomas Robinson (Lord
							Grantham)</ref>, &amp;c. &amp;c. who were frequent visitors at his house
						in town and country. The ladies I have named, were often staying at North
						End, at the period of his highest glory and reputation; and, in their
						company and conversation, his genius was matured. His benevolence was
						unbounded, as his manner of diffusing it was delicate and refined. </p>

					<hi rendition="#smcaps">The</hi> correspondence of <ref

					before his first publications, and extends through the remainder of his life.
					Before the appearance of <title>Pamela</title>, he does not seem to have
					transcribed <pb n="cxci"/> his own letters. After his celebrity was acquired,
					they probably assumed an importance in his eyes, which they did not possess
					before. In the decline of life, letter-writing was his favourite employment; It
					is one which men are apt to have either a fondness for, or an aversion to. He
					wrote more than he read. &quot;I cannot tell why,&quot; he says, &quot;but my
					nervous disorders will permit me to write with more impunity than to read;&quot;
					and he often laments, that, through want of time, and ill-health, he was not
					better acquainted with books. He usually wrote upon a little board, which he
					held in his hand. </p>
				<p> The correspondents of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> were either those connected with him by business, by
					personal friendship, or those attracted by his fame as an author. A large
					proportion of them are ladies. It has been observed how fond he was of female
					society. In this he resembled another amiable genius, the <ref
						target="people.html#CowperWilliam">author of the Task</ref>; both <pb
						n="cxcii"/> felt the depressing influence of a bashful sensibility, and both
					felt their hearts opened by the caressing manners and delicate attentions of
					female friendship. There was, indeed, this great difference: <ref
						target="people.html#CowperWilliam">Cowper</ref>&apos;s reserve was
					constitutional. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
					>Richardson</ref>&apos;s, probably, was owing to the want of an early
					familiarity with genteel life. </p>
				<p> The earliest correspondent upon this list is <ref target="people.html#HillAaron"
							><hi rendition="#smcaps">Aaron Hill</hi></ref>, a man of some real
					genius, a warm heart, and a generous disposition. He wrote several plays, was at
					one time manager of the theatre, several poems, one in praise of Czar Peter,
					called the <title>Northern Star</title>, yet is better known to most readers of
					the present day, by the lines <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>
					bestowed upon him in the <title>Dunciad</title>, than by his own works.
					Conscious of originality of thought, which he really had, he affected to despise
					the public taste; and fondly prophesied, that posterity would read his works
					when <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>&apos;s were fallen into
					oblivion. He did <pb n="cxciii"/> not so far trust to Posterity, however, as not
					to retaliate on his satirist in some finished lines, which may bear a comparison
					with <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>&apos;s on <ref

				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#HillAaron">Hill</ref> was a schemer, an unsuccessful
					one all his life. During the greatest part of this correspondence, he lived
					retired at Plaistow, an aguish situation, from which the health of himself and
					his family seem to have suffered much. In this retirement he wrote several
					poems; the following lines, in which he speaks of himself, are very touching:

					<ref target="people.html#SkeltonPhilip">Mr. <hi rendition="#smcaps"
						>Skelton</hi></ref> was a singular character; most singular, perhaps, in his
					uncommon benevolence. Placed in the wildest part of Ireland, amongst a people
					who differed more from the brutes around them in the evils to which human wants
					exposed them, than in any improvements or advantages with which human intellect
					had supplied them, he devoted his life, (the life of a scholar) and, in a year
					of scarcity, sacrificed his books, (the treasure of a scholar) for their relief.
					He was of an athletic make, and had often occasion to exercise his personal
					courage, as well as his pastoral care, amongst his flock. He used to go out
					attended by a <milestone n="i 4" unit="signature"/><pb n="cc"/> great dog, and a
					stout labourer, armed, as well as himself, with a huge club, when he made his
					pastoral visits in the neighbourhood. His connection with <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> bore upon two
					points: his good offices exerted towards his friend in the affair of the piracy,
					and in getting in his Irish debts (no easy matter to perform) and on the
					publications he sent to <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
						Richardson</ref>&apos;s press. He was esteemed a writer of strength and
					acumen in the controversial line. His letters are frank and hearty; they shew
					him occasionally subject to the pettishness of low spirits, and it is pleasing
					to observe with what tenderness, forbearance, and calm reasoning, his friend
					smooths away the roughness of his disposition. There is a life of <ref
						target="people.html#SkeltonPhilip">Skelton</ref> published in Ireland, which
					is worth reading, as it gives many particulars of an original and eccentric
					character. He was, at length, transplanted to Dublin; but too late to change his
					manners from the rustic to the urbane.</p>

						>Richardson</ref>&apos;s translators. </p>
				<p> But the largest contributor to this correspondence was <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady <hi rendition="#smcaps"
							>Bradshaigh</hi></ref>, of whose family and connections some account may
					be acceptable. </p>
				<p> She married (after a persevering court- <pb n="cciii"/> ship, on his part, of
					ten years, as she herself informs us) Sir Roger Bradshaigh, of Haigh, near
					Wigan, in Lancashire, at which place they lived in what was called the true
					English stile of country gentry, before the villa of the manufacturer had
					eclipsed, by its ephemeral splendour, the paternal seat of the hereditary
					landholder. </p>
				<p> Haigh is a large old-built mansion; the grounds and gardens are laid out in that
					style which modern refinement has discarded for one which is generally admitted
					to be more agreeable to true taste, though, perhaps it may not be calculated to
					give more pleasure. Sir Roger&apos;s estate was in the midst of the mines of
					that most elegant species of coal called the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>cannel</hi>, or <hi rendition="#italics">candle</hi> coal, which, it is
					well known, takes a high and beautiful polish. Of this material <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> built a
					summer-house. From its colour, like black marble, and its combustible nature, it
					may be considered as a kind of contrast to the brilliant ice-palace of the
					Empress of Russia. </p>
				<pb n="cciv"/>
				<p><ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> bore the
					character of a most worthy, pious, and charitable woman. Sir Roger and herself
					were a very happy couple, as, indeed, sufficiently appears from the letters. She
					was active and managing, and her large houshold was so regulated as to be a
					pattern of order and decorum. They had no children. <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> lived many
					years at Haigh, as a widow, keeping up the same stile of chearful hospitality as
					in her husband&apos;s life-time. She died at an advanced age, above eighty, with
					all the sentiments of a piety which had been habitually wrought into the
					constitution of her mind. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref>&apos;s mental
					qualifications seem to have been a good deal of sound native sense, and strong
					feeling, with a lively impressible imagination. She wrote with ease, and was
					fond of writing. She had a chearful and generous disposition, as well as great
					natural vivacity, and in her letters exhibits a flow of expression, which, if
					the critic will not admit to be wit, must at <pb n="ccv"/> least be allowed to
					rise to an agreeable sprightliness. </p>
				<p> Ladies, at that period, were far from enjoying those advantages of education
					which offer themselves to the present rising generation; at a distance from the
					metropolis, especially, a reading female was a sort of phenomenon, and the
					county in which <ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady
						Bradshaigh</ref> lived was, by no means, the first to free itself from these
					symptoms of rusticity. Accordingly, we observe in the correspondence, that <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> was much
					disturbed by the fear of being known by her neighbours to correspond with an
					author, and to escape the imputation, very ingeniously, after <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had sent her his
					portrait, changed his name into <hi rendition="#italics">Dick</hi>enson, that
					the questions asked her about her distant friend, might not betray her secret.
					She, indeed, was by no means a literary woman, and <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> combats the
					narrowness of her notions on the subject of <pb n="ccvi"/> female learning; yet
					she read a great variety of English books, and her remarks upon them are, in
					general, judicious. In the subjects of controversy between herself and her
					correspondent, she would oftener have the better of the argument, if <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had not laid hold on
					strong and unguarded expressions to teaze and perplex her, and many topics he
					insists on evidently for the sake of argument. An excellent heart is shewn by
					this lady throughout the whole; she seems to have been rather a hearty friend
					and a clever active woman, than a polished one. She had the highest veneration
					for <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, and for his
					productions. The eager and passionate interest she took in the story of <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>, though carried to
					almost a whimsical excess, does honour to the powers of the author, and the
					feelings of the lady. She seems to have considered <ref
						target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> and <ref
						target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> as real beings, whose <pb
						n="ccvii"/> fate the writer held in his hands.&#8212;&quot;Pray, Sir, make
					her happy, you can so easily do it! Pray reform him! Will you not save a soul,
					Sir?&quot; The circumstances in which the correspondence begun and was carried
					on, under a feigned name, for above a year, bear a romantic cast, and the
					gradual steps of the discovery cannot fail of amusing the reader. No lover ever
					expected his mistress with greater ardour than the grave <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> seems to have felt
					for his <hi rendition="#italics">incognita</hi>, when he paced so fruitlessly up
					and down the Mall, gazing with expectation at every lady he met. Indeed, they
					were very near teasing one another into serious ill-humour on the
					occasion.&#8212;Though <ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady
						Bradshaigh</ref> did not give the kind of assistance many imagined to <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, he often made use of
					her remarks and criticisms. To mention a trivial instance, he altered the month
					of July, in which he had originally made <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron"
						>Miss Byron</ref>
					<pb n="ccviii"/> come up to London, to January, on her representation that July
					was not the season which would be chosen for a young lady to see the town. Her
					letters extend from the year 1750 to the death of <ref
						target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, a period of eleven
					years. They, together with <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref>&apos;s answers, would alone make several volumes, I
					believe as many as the whole of this publication, a proof, by the way, that the
					bookseller and the editor have had some mercy on the public. </p>
				<p>
					<ref target="people.html#EchlinElizabeth">Lady <hi rendition="#smcaps"
							>Echlin</hi></ref> was the sister of <ref
						target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref>, and wife to
					Sir Robert Echlin, nephew, by marriage, to <ref
						target="people.html#TickellThomas">Mr. Tickell</ref>, the friend of <ref
						target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>. With the <ref
						target="people.html#TickellThomas">Tickell</ref>s, with <ref
						target="people.html#LambardLady">Lady Lambard</ref>, and other worthy
					people, she was very respectably connected, as also with the good Bishop <ref
						target="people.html#HildesleyMark">Hildesley</ref>, whose preferment to the
					Isle of Man she compares to the banishment of <ref
						target="people.html#SaintJohn">St. John</ref> to the Island of Patmos. Her
					country seat, at Villa Rusa, was on the <pb n="ccix"/> sea-coast, directly
					opposite to his residence. <ref target="people.html#EchlinElizabeth">Lady
						Echlin</ref> had not the parts and vivacity of her sister; she seems to have
					been rather a good and pious, than a brilliant woman: but piety and goodness it
					is always pleasing to contemplate. She appears, indeed, from her favourable
					mention of the <ref target="people.html#HuntingdonSelina">Countess of
						Huntingdon</ref>, and other circumstances, to have been of that class who
					make piety not only the regulator of their conduct, but the business of their
					lives. One might suppose novels would form a small part of the reading of such a
					woman, but the novels of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
						>Richardson</ref> were received by his admirers as manuals of instruction,
					and <ref target="people.html#EchlinElizabeth">Lady Echlin</ref>, in particular,
					considered the morality of them, not only as the indispensible, but as the only
					material point. She too was seized with the desire of altering
						<title>Clarissa</title>, and making up the story to her own mind, which she
					accordingly executed, and after some hesitation and reluctance communicated to
						<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>.&#8212; <pb
						n="ccx"/> She had reformed <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>
					by means of a Dr. Christian, and made him die after a lingering illness,
					occasioned by remorse, though the last outrage is not supposed to be committed.
					Though <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, after he had
					read her alterations, let her off very gently, one cannot but suspect he must
					secretly smile at the presumption which had induced so inferior a hand to lay
					colours upon his canvas. <ref target="people.html#EchlinElizabeth">Lady
						Echlin</ref> lived chiefly in England, after she became a widow. </p>
				<p> Nothing tends so strongly to place us in the midst of the generations that are
					past, as a perusal of their correspondence. To have their very letters, their
					very handwriting before our eyes, gives a more intimate feeling of their
					existence, than any other memorial of them. To see the heart that is now chilled
					with age, or cold in the dust, pouring forth its first youthful feelings; to see
					the hopes and fears, the friendships and animosities, the pains and cares of
					life, as it passes on, inspires the soul <pb n="ccxi"/> with a tender
					melancholy. We see some, now established in fame, who at first advanced timid
					and doubting of their own powers; others sunk into oblivion, who had the highest
					confidence in them; we see secret kindnesses brought to light; and where there
					has been affectation of any kind, we see it did not avail, but that the man is
					known, and the real motives of his actions, through all the glosses he puts on.
					We compare the tar-water of one age with the medicated airs of another, and the
					waters of Tunbridge with the sea-bathing places, and we find both equally
					inefficacious against the long-rooted malady, and touched with a deep feeling of
					the vanity of life, we cry out with <ref target="people.html#ThomsonJames"
