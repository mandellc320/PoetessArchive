               </hi>, was
                    born in the year 1731, at Pallas in the county of Longford in Ireland, according
                    to his epitaph in Westminster Abbey; but another account mentions Elphin as his
                    birth-place. His character was eccentric; his pursuits were desultory. His
                    father, who was a clergyman, gave him a classical education, and sent him from
                    school to Dublin college. Like <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, he is said to have exhibited no peculiar marks of quickness in
                    this period of his life, and he did not take his bachelor's degree till two
                    years after the usual time.</p>
            <p>As he was intended for the study of physic, he removed to the university of
                    Edinburgh in 1751, where he staid three years; but he seems not to have brought
                    with him to this seminary much steadiness of application or ardour for
                    professional studies, and he was obliged to quit it clandestinely on account of
                    a debt he had contracted;—it is said, for a fellow-student, but probably
                    the consequence of that mutual accommodation which often subsists between young

                    was released through the friendship of two fellow-students. The world was now

                    embarked immediately for Holland; and poor as he was, and struggling with
                    difficulties of every kind, performed a tour, mostly on foot, through that
                    country, Flanders, and part of Germany. He passed some time at the universities
                    of Paris and Louvain, and took a bachelor's degree of physic at the latter
                    of these seminaries. He thence accompanied an English gentlemen to Geneva and
                    was there recommended as a travelling tutor to a man of fortune.</p>

                    the youth, who had just succeeded to a large fortune, was as impatient of being
                    guided, as his tutor was unused to guide. Be that as it may, their connexion was
                    soon dissolved by a disagreement, and poor <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> was left alone in the
                    south of France, friendless and destitute in a foreign country, to find his way
                    home, or pursue his tour as he could. Uncomfortable as many circumstances in
                    this excursion must have been, it was here that the young poet laid in those
                    images which afterwards produced his beautiful poem of <title>

                    great metropolis, with his pressing wants, and only his talents to provide for
                    them. Without introduction, and of no promising appearance as to externals, he
                    offered himself as journeyman to several apothecaries without success, and was
                    at length obliged to accept of employment in the laboratory of a chemist near

               <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> did not remain long in
                    a situation so little adapted to his education and talents: he was recommended

                    portion of men eminent for literature; but it cannot be said that their
                    gratitude has led them to any partiality for that mode of life; as, on the
                    contrary, they have generally taken care to show the disgust they had conceived
                    against the employment, by painting in pretty strong colours, as <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> has done in his

            <p>He soon quitted this situation; and having become acquainted with the
                    booksellers, and being employed by them, he took lodgings in London, and became
                    author by profession. He was at first employed in the <ref target="people.html#ReviewMonthly">

                    which were afterwards collected in his works under the title of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Citizen of the World</hi>
               </title>. He also
                    published a weekly paper called <title>

                        Bee</hi>
               </title>, and other pieces. But he was still amongst the drudges of
                    literature, working in obscurity, and his name was unknown to the public, till
                    he suddenly emerged into light by the publication of his <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Traveller</hi>
               </title>, in 1765, which at once
                    lifted him to an eminent station amongst the English poets. Both the character
                    and scenery of different countries are touched in this poem with a rapid but
                    masterly hand. Those of Holland and Switzerland are particularly striking. The
                    moral and <pb n="v"/>political reflections that are introduced seem rather
                    suggested by the necessity of finding a cement to bind the separate parts
                    together, than by any spirit of philosophical research. The charming
                    descriptions dwell upon the mind, but the moral is forgotten; or, if remembered,
                    it is only to awaken the mind to the fallacy of the maxim, that <hi rendition="#italics">every form of civil society is equal in its influence

                    vulgar resort where he used to laugh and amuse himself. He went on, however,
                    with his literary schemes; and in the next year <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Vicar of Wakefield</hi>
               </title> made its appearance. This
                    delightful little novel had indeed been written some time before, and by the
                    intervention of <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref> sold
                    for sixty pounds, which went to discharge the author's rent. But
                    booksellers are not always judges of their own goods, and the manuscript was
                    kept back through diffidence of its success, till the author had acquired a name
                    by his poem. Thus he had the ill-luck to dispose of both works as the first
                    productions of an unknown author.</p>
            <p>His fame as a writer was now established, and from this time he was employed in a

                    supplied in him the deficiencies of science: his style was easy and flowing, and

               </title>, which he published in 1770, and of which
                    he seems hardly to have been sen-<pb n="vii"/>sible of the merit; for he refused
                    at first to take the hundred pounds which the bookseller offered for it, saying,
                    it was five shillings a couplet—more than the sale of a poem could ever
                    repay. It may be thought, perhaps, that authors and booksellers understand one
                    another better at this period.</p>
            <p>There is scarcely any poem in the English language, in which harmony, beautiful
                    description, and pathos are united with greater effect than in this piece. The
                    plan of it is an expansion of the concluding lines of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Traveller</hi>
               </title>, and displays the same
                    prejudice, if it be prejudice, against commercial opulence. Many inquiries were
                    made at the time, where the village of "sweet Auburn" had been
                    situated. It is to be found in the county of Roscommon: its population or
                    depopulation existed probably only in the poet's fancy, as it does not
                    appear that he ever visited Ireland after he had left it, but the images cannot
                    be contemplated without the most lively emotion. The character of the good
                    pastor does not suffer by a comparison with <ref target="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</ref>'s. It was probably meant for his brother, whom he
                    describes in his address to him as "having retired to happiness and
                    obscurity on an income of 40<hi rendition="#italics">l</hi>. a year;" and
                    for whom he seems to have entertained an ardent affection and esteem. The
                    schoolmaster, and the village alehouse, are streaked with that humour which
                    characterizes his <title>

               </title>. It is difficult to say which of his two poems has
                    most poetical merit: but this was certainly the most popular. It interested the
                    feelings. The four <pb n="viii"/> last lines, as well as the ten concluding ones
                    of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Traveller</hi>
               </title>, were given him by

            <p>Two years after this he hazarded another attempt to make the public laugh, and
                    this time succeeded. His comedy <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">She Stoops to
                            Conquer</hi>
               </title> is full of absurdities, and the humour of it hardly
                    rises above farce. His friends had great apprehensions for its fate. <ref target="people.html#CumberlandRichard">Mr. Cumberland</ref>, in his
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Memoirs</hi>
               </title>, gives a very
                    entertaining account of the manœuvres practised by his friends, by posting
                    people in different parts of the house to laugh and clap at the appointed
                    places, in order to secure its success. The author himself came into the house
                    when they were beginning a hiss at some passage. "What noise is that?"
                    said he, in much alarm. "Oh doctor," said <ref target="people.html#ColmanGeorgeElder">Colman</ref>, "do not be afraid
                    of squibs, when we have been sitting these two hours upon a barrel of
                    gunpowder." He did not forgive this sally.</p>
            <p>The last work <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> was
                    employed in was his <title>

                    was now established, and the profits of his labours were such as ought to have
                    made his circumstances perfectly easy: but he was a man of no regularity or
                    worldly prudence, and, besides a propensity to show and expense, he had
                    contracted an unfortunate habit of gaming, which involved him in pecuniary
                    distress: his constitution too began to <pb n="ix"/>give way, and he fell into a
                    state of dejection, in which he expressed almost a weariness of life. In this
                    state he was seized with a fever, which, assisted by a large dose of medicine
                    which he took contrary to the advice of his physician, carried him off in March,
                    1774, at the early age of five-and-forty. A monument was erected for him in
                    Westminster Abbey, with an elegant epitaph by his steady friend <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> was awkward and uncouth
                    in his person and manners. He did not shine in company, and seems to have had
                    more than common propensity to blundering and confusion of ideas which is
                    generally attributed to his countrymen. He had no powers of conversation, and
                    seems to have been in some measure the butt of the wits with whom he associated.
                    This consciousness of inferiority, which is never perhaps felt so much as in
                    what regards personal intercourse, probably occasioned the feeling of envy to
                    which it is acknowledged he was unfortunately subject. He was generous; and a
                    great part of his expenses, as well as the most laudable, consisted in
                    benefactions to poor authors and other objects of his beneficence. He had known
                    distress, and was never tardy in relieving it. In other respects he was a man of
                    rather fine feelings than of pure morals. Unfortunately they do not always go
                    together.</p>
            <p>The last piece that came from his pen was a little poem, entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Retaliation</hi>
               </title>, which was written by way
                    of retort to the raillery of his friends at the literary club, who had been
                    amusing themselves with writing humorous <pb n="x"/> epitaphs upon him. The
                    characters which, in the form of epitaphs, he has given in return, are drawn
                    with spirit, and upon the whole cannot be called severe; but the sport of this
                    kind always carries a sting in it. In the character of <ref target="people.html#agarrickDavid">Garrick</ref>, the inordinate appetite for
                    praise of that accomplished actor was too truly touched not to irritate the
                    jealousy of his self-love, and he retaliated by an epigrammatic fable of much
                    more severity. </p>
            <p>Of all the walks in which <ref target="people.html#agoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> exercised his genius, that of poetry is the one in which it
                    shone the brightest. Of his compositions in this line the bulk is small; but for
                    beautiful discription, touching sentiment, and a harmony of versification that
                    operates like a charm upon any one who has an ear for poetry, they are scarcely
                    exceeded by any in the language. His <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Vicar of
                            Wakefield</hi>
               </title> is the only Novel he ever wrote, and it is one of
                    the most pleasing we have. It is in this work that the author's talent for
                    humour most successfully displays itself. Many of the incidents are irresistibly
                    comic. Such are the gravity and self-importance of Moses, when he produces his
                    bargain of spectacles with silver rims; the expedition to church upon Blackberry
                    and Dobbin; the family picture, which was too large to enter the doors; the
                    slyness of the vicar in overturning the cosmetic, while he pretended to stir the
                    fire; and the schemes and plottings of good notable Mrs. Primrose with her
                    gooseberry wine. We are at once touched and diverted with the harmless vanities
                    of the whole group, joined with innocence and benevolence. The character of the
                    vicar somewhat resembles Par-<pb n="xi"/>son Adams,<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot">The protagonist's companion in <title>

                    and perhaps still more the author's own village pastor, "a man to all

               </hi> He is distinguished from the former by an admirable vein of
                    dry humour, and resembles him in the honest simplicity of a man without guile:
                    to this is joined a touch of professional vanity. In the serious parts of the
                    story his behaviour is highly dignified; and it is hoped there are few who can
                    read his discourse in the prison, when the good man is stripped of his all and
                    overwhelmed with calamities, without feeling those emotions at once salutary and
                    gratifying, which goodness and piety bearing up against misfortune are
                    calculated to inspire. The benevolence and piety of Adams have always something
                    ludicrous in them: the Vicar of Wakefield is a higher character. His kind
                    feelings towards his family, the affecting tenderness with which he receives
                    again his repentant daughter, his hospitality and flowing benevolence, with his
                    behaviour in every scene of distress, make him a pleasing and venerable
                    character, and are evidently painted by a man who, whatever were his faults,
                    strongly felt the enthusiasm of virtue and piety.</p>
            <p>The plot of this piece is full of improbabilities and absurdities. All that
                    relates to the two kept-mistresses is coarse and low; the character of Burchell,
                    alias Sir William, is too romantic for a representation of real life, and even
                    in his love there is a great want of delicacy, or he would not have insulted his
                    mistress with pretending to make a match between her and the fellow
                    Jenkinson:—but whatever be its faults, we easily <pb n="xii"/>forgive the
                    author, who has made us laugh, and has made us cry. In the adventures of the
                    eldest son the author has related some of the vicissitudes of his own life. It
                    must not be forgotten that this novel is enriched with two specimens of the
                    author's poetical powers. The first, "When lovely woman stoops to
                        folly,"<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot">The short poem is sung

                    wonderfully pathetic. It is sweet as music, and polished like a gem. <title>
