                    distinguished novel-writer in the walk of humour, was born in 1707, at

                    rising in the world; and, with the parts which nature had given him, of filling
                    a distinguished station in some one of the more honourable professions. <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Henry</ref> was first put under the care

                    professor of civil law, for two years, and distinguished himself as much by his
                    application, as by the strength of his parts and his love for literature. At
                    that interesting period of his education, his progress was cut short by
                    pecuniary difficulties. His father had married a second time, and the pressure
                    of an increasing family (no less than six sons being born to him in addition to
                    four children of the first bed) rendered it impossible for the general to
                    continue his eldest son’s remittances at the university. He was therefore
                    obliged to return to England; and found himself at the age of twenty in the
                    metropolis, pretty much his own master, and exposed to every allurement to
                    pleasure and dissipation.</p>
            <p> There is scarcely any profession from which there are so many deserters as from
                    the law. A sprightly young man, who has imbibed in his preliminary education a
                    strong taste for the more elegant parts of literature, is very apt to disrelish
                        <pb n="iii"/> the dry and severe studies to which he is devoted; and the
                    temptations to pleasure, to which by living so much at large he is peculiarly
                    exposed, and which he has seldom the force to resist, sap the vigour of his
                    mind, and induce him to turn away from a pursuit which requires the unbroken
                    powers of the whole man. Young <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> was peculiarly susceptible of these impressions: still, had
                    he continued where he had so well begun, at Leyden, in a comparatively sober
                    town, among grave professors, and students occupied in preparing for their
                    future destination, it is probably we might have possessed another eminent
                    barrister or judge, and that we should not have had <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Joseph Andrews</hi>
               </title> and <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom Jones</hi>
               </title>.—Be that as it may,
                    his coming to London at so critical a period was decisive of his character and
                    fortunes. He had a good person, a quick relish of pleasure, a constitution
                    remarkably strong, and a decided turn for social enjoyment; so that no doubt his
                    disposition met half way the temptations his situation exposed him to. His
                    allowance from his father was nominally two hundred a year; which, he was used
                    to say, any body might pay that would. To supply the deficiencies of his income,
                    and support a gay life in London, he began to write for the stage, and in the
                    succeeding ten years produced three-and-twenty dramatic compositions, farces
                    included, a number many times greater than <ref target="people.html#CongreveWilliam">Congreve</ref> had given to the public
                    during the course of a long life. The greater part of these pieces met with but
                    indifferent <milestone unit="signature" n="a 2" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="iv"/> success at the time, and few of them have stood their ground to the present
                    day. </p>
            <p> It has been matter of surprise to those who contemplated <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> in the quality of a
                    novelist, that an author, whose characteristics are genuine humour and
                    delineation of character, should have succeeded so ill in comedy; for what is a
                    comedy but a short story, or novel put into dialogue? and the more of dialogue
                    there is in the novel, the more spirit it possesses; so that they seem to be
                    very kindred modes of writing.</p>
            <p> But it must be considered, in the first place, that a dramatic writer, being
                    confined by time and other circumstances belonging to representation on the
                    stage, is obliged to concentrate his powers, and give the effect by a spirited
                    outline, which the novel-writer has leisure to produce by the slow and patient
                    touches of a more leisurely pencil. Comedy also requires much more delicate
                    management. Coarse incidents and language may pass in relation, which would
                    disgust upon the stage; where, every thing being in action, an indelicacy or
                    awkwardness becomes much more prominent than when it meets the eye of the
                    solitary reader in the pages of a book; and the least circumstance that provokes
                    a laugh at the piece is sufficient to ruin it for ever. A quicker sense of
                    propriety is exercised on the benches of a theatre than at the desk of the
                    reader. In the drama, moreover, the <hi rendition="#italics">author</hi> is not
                    allowed to show himself; by which the wit of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> would lose much of its
                    poignancy. He does not dramatize his novel so much as <pb n="v"/> many others
                    have done. The <hi rendition="#italics">author's</hi> learning, the <hi rendition="#italics">author's</hi> wit appear continually, not only in
                    his digressive chapters, but in the representations of the characters and secret
                    views of his personages; and the humour is continually heightened by the
                    contrast between the author's style and his views of things, and the
                    characters he is holding up to ridicule. </p>
            <p> But the want of merit in <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s comedies may be ascribed to other causes. They were his
                    first productions; and, like most of the productions of youth, rather drawn from
                    what he had read than what he had seen. He could not be supposed, at the age of
                    twenty, to have attained that knowledge of life and character which he exhibited
                    when, in a maturer age, he wrote his <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom
                            Jones</hi>
               </title>. The English stage has few models of elegant comedy,
                    and he seems to have taken his from <ref target="people.html#CongreveWilliam">Congreve</ref> and <ref target="people.html#WycherleyWilliam">Wycherley</ref>, and to have imitated their loose and vicious morals
                    without their humour and brilliancy. Most of his pieces also were written in the
                    intervals of pleasures and dissipation, with great rapidity, and upon the spur
                    of the occasion, that is, the occasion for a present supply of money. He himself
                    entertained a pretty great contempt for the judgement of the town, and hardened
                    himself against censure by despising his censurers. He has printed one of his
                    farces "as it was damned at the theatre royal, Drury Lane."<hi rendition="#sup">

               </title>, is the only
                    one of his pieces which at present maintains its ground at the theatre. Yet,
                    though there is nothing in the humour of the character which does not seem very
                    capable of being transferred, it by no means holds the same rank of the English
                    stage which <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">L'Avare</hi>
               </title> does on
                    the French.—It is worthy of remark, that the liberties taken with some
                    political characters, in one or two of our author’s pieces, are said to have
                    been the immediate occasion of passing the act for limiting the number of
                    theatres, and subjecting dramatic compositions to the inspection of the lord
                    chamberlain. A restraint perhaps necessary, and no doubt permanent.</p>
            <p> The farces of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> were
                    generally the production of two or three mornings. When he had contracted for a
                    play or farce, he has often been known to go home late from a tavern, and <pb n="vii"/> send a scene or two the next morning written on the papers that
                    had wrapped up his tobacco, of which he was immoderately fond. Notwithstanding
                    the number of his pieces, they do not seem to have been very productive to him
                    in a pecuniary light. For one, which was acted six nights, he received only
                    sixty pounds.</p>
            <p> In the midst of this career of dissipation, <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> fell in love with and
                    married <ref target="people.html#CradockCharlotte">Miss Craddock</ref> of
                    Salisbury, a celebrated beauty with a fortune of 1500<hi rendition="#italics">l</hi>. About the same time, by his mother's death, he succeeded to an
                    estate of something more than two hundred a year. Upon these events he formed
                    the wise resolution to retire with his wife, whom he passionately loved, into
                    the country, and to forsake the gaieties and vices of a town life. He went
                    accordingly to Stower in Dorsetshire, where his little estate lay. And here he
                    might have purified his mind and corrected his taste. No longer obliged to write
                    for a dinner, he might have felt only the gentle and salutary stimulus of
                    bettering his fortune and increasing his enjoyments by the productions of his
                    pen. But unfortunately he took it into his head to vie in expense with the
                    country gentlemen his neighbours. The sound of a family estate has a wonderful
                    effect upon some men. It was probably an idea of this kind, added to a
                    thoughtlessness now become habitual, that made him launch out in the absurd
                    manner he did. He had a carriage, a large establishment of servants in gaudy
                    liveries; he gave dinners, kept hounds and horses, and found means, in less than
                    three years, entirely to dis- <pb n="viii"/> sipate his little patrimony. Some
                    of these follies he has pourtrayed, softened no doubt, in the character of Booth
                    in his <title>

            <p> He was now again obliged to draw subsistence from his own resources; and it is
                    some praise to the vigour of his mind, and shows it was able to recover its
                    spring, that he formed the resolution of seriously applying to the law, his
                    original destination. He was about thirty when he entered himself at the Temple,
                    and it is agreed that his application was laudable. He was one of those
                    characters to whom mental exertion is more easy than abstinence from pleasure;
                    and the good foundation he had laid in early life enabled him to recover a great
                    deal of his lost ground.</p>
            <p> After he was called to the bar, he attended the courts and went the circuits,
                    but never had any great flow of business, though he is said to have acquired a
                    very respectable share of legal knowledge, and even to have gone deep into some
                    particular branches of it, as he left behind him two volumes folio upon crown
                    law. The gout also, which he had by this time earned, began to make depredations
                    upon his constitution. He was therefore obliged to recur again to his pen to
                    supply the wants of a growing family; and essays, plays, and political pamphlets
                    were the product of his leisure. He wrote in a periodical paper called

                    been sinking under ill health. This stroke he felt with an acuteness of
                    sensibility which perhaps would scarcely have been expected in a man of
                    pleasure; his grief was so strong that his friends were even afraid his reason

                    from the failure of his hopes of rising in the more brilliant career of the bar.
                    In this laborious and at that time not very respectable office, he was active
                    and diligent; and he published several tracts with the laudable design of
                    checking the vices of the populace. An active magistrate was extremely wanted at
                    that time. Robberies were frequent, and atrocious murders had been committed

               </title>. He was about
                    four-and-forty when he wrote it; a period of life when judgement, invention, and
                    observation go hand in hand, and man possesses all his powers together. After
                    the publication of this celebrated novel, we may regard the author as in the
                    meridian of his fame, and possessed, through his various labours, of the means
                    of living with ease and comfort: but his constitution, naturally strong, and his
                    frame, originally athletic, undermined by irregularity and broken by fatigue,
                    were now sinking apace; notwithstanding which he published, four years
                    afterwards, his <title>

                    original; and, like the second rainbow, though the same colours are seen, they
                    shine with fainter radiance. It has more of sentiment than humour, more of
                    narrative than of scenes passing before the eye.</p>

                    at the head of the London police, though he had the misfortune to be blind from
                    his birth. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Henry Fielding</ref> was in his person
                    tall, and of a robust make with an originally strong constitution, qualities
                    which, perhaps for that reason, he seems fond of attributing to his heroes. He
                    was social, hospitable, fond of pleasure, and apt to be impatient under
                    disappointment or ill usage. Though he might not be a very faithful, he was a
                    very affectionate husband, as well as a very fond father; all the sympathies of
                    a feeling heart were alive in him. By seeing much of the vicious part of
                    mankind, professionally in his latter years and by choice in his earlier, his
                    mind received a taint which spread itself in his works, but was powerfully
                    counteracted by the better sensibilities of his nature. Notwithstanding his
                    irregularities, he was not without a sense of religion, and had collected
                    materials for an An- <pb n="xiii"/> swer to <ref target="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Lord Bolingbroke</ref>'s
                    posthumous works, in which he would probably have been much out of his depth. No
                    portrait was taken of him during his life. <ref target="people.html#HogarthWilliam">Hogarth</ref>, with whom he had an
                    intimate friendship, executed one after his death, partly from recollection and

                    is prefixed to the edition of his works in ten volumes, with his Life, published

            <p> J<hi rendition="#smcaps">oseph</hi> A<hi rendition="#smcaps">ndrews</hi>, the

                    performance to those who have a taste for genuine humour. There is little or
                    nothing in it of story, compared with the elaborate plan of his subsequent work;
                    nor so great a variety of characters: on which account the performance is
                    inferior, but it possesses, in quite an equal degree, the comic spirit of the
                    author. He professes to have written it in the manner of <ref target="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</ref>; and accordingly the style,
                    where the author himself speaks, is in a kind of mock heroic, particularly in
                    the introductory flourishes, where he ushers in the incidents of a foot-race, or
                    a boxing-match between two rustics, in the pompous and lofty phrase which might
                    be used to describe one of <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref>'s
                    battles. This manner he has preserved in his other novels: in all of them the
                        <hi rendition="#italics">author</hi> is constantly kept in sight, and the
                    grave humour of the piece is heightened by <hi rendition="#italics">his</hi>
                    remarks. The plan of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, on the contrary, which was to make his characters tell their

               <pb n="xiv"/> author:—each
                    mode has its advantages, that of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> is perhaps the most difficult. The most striking figure in
                    this piece is that of Parson Adams, an original and most diverting character, in
                    which the lights and shades are so admirably blended, and estimable qualities so
                    mixed with foibles and eccentricities, that we love and laugh at him at the same
                    time. </p>
            <p> Adams is a country curate of great learning and integrity, very benevolent, and
                    of such simplicity of heart that, to use the author’s expression, "he never
                    sees further into men than they choose to let him." In common with many
                    deep scholars, he is subject to great absence of mind, which brings him into
                    many ludicrous difficulties; and he has a tincture of harmless vanity which
                    leads him sometimes to assume more self-importance than belongs to his humble
                    station. </p>
            <p> The author has shown great skill in making us laugh so heartily at a character,
                    and yet keeping it above contempt. This could not have been done in the
                    degrading scenes of low life to which he is exposed, if he had not, in addition
                    to his higher qualities, given him great personal courage and an athletic
                    constitution; so that in the scenes in which his poverty exposes him to insult,
                    his Herculean strength and intrepidity make us feel that, though he may be
                    played upon, he is not to be trampled on; and the reader is well pleased to see
                    that he generally gets the better in the rough contests in which he is engaged.
                    It has been sometimes objected to <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> that so good a man as Adams, a clergyman, and a scholar,
                    should be held up to ridicule; but <pb n="xv"/> it should be considered that
                    comic characters were what he sought, and what his genius led him to exhibit;
                    that such mixed characters do exist, and that our feelings are properly excited
                    in due proportion to the excellencies and eccentricities of this amusing
                    personage. His learning redeems his ignorance of the world; his simplicity does
                    not proceed from want of sense, but want of penetration, which arises in great
                    measure from his candour and singleness of heart: his absence of mind harmonizes
                    with his erudition. A man of his stamp is not unlikely to forget his horse at an
                    inn, to wade through a brook instead of crossing a stile to find a dry path, and
                    to leave the sermons behind him which he came to London to print. It is asserted

                    him that, while he was chaplain to a regiment in Flanders, he took a solitary
                    ramble one fine summer's evening, and, falling into a deep reverie, walked
                    on till he came to the enemy's camp, where he was with difficulty brought
                    to his recollection by the <hi rendition="#italics">Qui va là?</hi>

            <p> Two other characters of clergymen appear in this work, those of Barnabas and
                    Trulliber. Trulliber feeding his hogs and tyrannizing over his <pb n="xvi"/>
                    wife is a truly Dutch piece, and worthy the pencil of a <ref target="people.html#Teniers">Teniers</ref>. It is possible a Trulliber might
                    be found in a remote part of the country when the author wrote, but it is to be
                    presumed the race is now extinct. Barnabas is a character of hypocrisy and
                    selfishness, of which the world will always afford specimens. Joseph and Fanny
                    are sufficiently interesting: the latter is drawn with ease and simplicity.
                    Joseph is a hero in virtue, more so perhaps than might naturally have been
                    expected from the free pen of the author, who seems to have been induced to give
                    him this purity of character from a whimsical competition with the author of
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Pamela</hi>
               </title>, against which work
                    there are many sly strokes of satire. It is certain, however, that <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Joseph Andrews</hi>
               </title> is the most
                    unexceptional in point of morals of any of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s novels. So far as a
                    free exhibition of vicious characters may be objected to on the score of
                    delicacy, perhaps it is not free from blame, but in this it is far less
                    exceptionable than those of <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>; and there is between them this essential difference, that in
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Joseph Andrews</hi>
               </title> the interest
                    is constantly and uniformly thrown on the side of virtue. When our affections
                    are drawn forth, it is in favour of the innocent and the good; when we laugh, it
                    is at folly, affectation, or absurdity; when we feel detestation, it is at
                    hardness of heart, as in the behavior of the passengers in the stage-coach to
                    the wounded Joseph; or it is at brutality, hypocrisy, and deceit; so that, if
                        <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> had written only this
                    work, there could have been no doubt of his being ranked among the friends of
                    virtue. <pb n="xvii"/> In this panegyric must not however be included a very
                    dull history of a Mr. Wilson, inserted apparently, as well as another story of
                    Leonora, for the sake of filling up, though the work only consists of two
                    volumes. The story has the worse effect, as, after having passed through every
                    scene of vice and debauchery, Wilson is rewarded with a virtuous wife: and by
                    way of connecting this episodical story with the body of the work, the author
                    has made him the father of the virtuous and deserving Joseph. </p>
            <p> A number of other characters are touched with great truth and spirit. Mrs.
                    Slipslop has become proverbial for her phraseology, which has been imitated by
                    several novel-writers. Lady Booby is the prototype of Lady Bellaston.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> The discerning reader cannot
                    overlook Peter Pounce the steward, nor the simplicity of Adams, who believes him
                    in earnest when he pretends "not to be near so rich as people thought
                    him," and the <hi rendition="#italics">naïveté</hi> with which
                    the latter tells him, "that he always said it was impossible he could have
                    honestly massed so much, particularly as he inherited no fortune," with the
                    consequent anger of Pounce, all which conveys a satire as just as it is lively.
                    We are never better pleased than when, either in fiction or in real life, a
                    proud man receives a stroke of unintentional satire from one who has too much
                    simplicity to feel that he has given it. But to particularize the strokes of
                    nature and humour in this novel would be almost to transcribe the work; suffice
                    it to mention one or two. </p>
            <p> When Joseph, having rescued his Fanny from <milestone unit="signature" n="b 3" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="xviii"/> the hands of her ravisher, expresses
                    his impatience to have her made indissolubly his own; Adams rebukes him for his
                    impetuosity, telling him that "the passions are to be greatly subdued if
                    not totally eradicated, and that he ought not so to set his mind upon any person
                    or thing in this world, as that he cannot resign it quietly and contentedly,
                    when taken from him in any manner by divine Providence." At this moment
                    somebody comes in and tells him that his youngest son is drowned; and when
                    Joseph attempts to comfort him from some of the topics he had just insisted on,
                    the good man rejects them in the bitterness of his heart, and cries out,
                    "Child, child, do not attempt impossibilities, the loss of a child is one
                    of those great trials in which our grief is allowed to be immoderate." Yet
                    the exhortations of Adams are not common-place and hypocritical, like those of
                    Barnabas when he prayed by Joseph; his inconsistency is only the weakness of
                    human nature. The passage finely shows how difficult it is to put ourselves in
                    the place of others. It was impossible for Adams, with all his benevolence, to
                    enter into the impatient feelings of the young lovers. He was ready to serve,
                    but he could not sympathize with them. A younger man would have sympathized,
                    and, if he wanted benevolence, might not have served them. </p>
            <p> The winding up of this novel is the only part in which there is any aim at
                    intricacy; and it may perhaps be thought some disparagement to the invention of
                    the author, that the plot of two of his novels turns upon the discovery of
                    foundling <pb n="xix"/> children. As Joseph Andrews is made the brother of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela Andrews</ref>, and as both are

                    complained heavily of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>
                    that he had followed up the mode of writing which he had opened for him, and
                    made it a vehicle for abusing him; for, in fact, a good deal of ridicule is
                    thrown upon <hi rendition="#italics">Pamela</hi>, and <hi rendition="#italics">of that</hi> its author might complain. But his manner and that of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> are so totally different,
                    that each may be admired as an original writer without interference with the
                    other, and different tastes will be attracted by different talents. <hi rendition="#italics">Joseph Andrews</hi> may with more propriety be compared

                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom Jones</hi>
               </title>, a novel produced when the
                    author was in the meridian of his faculties, and after he had joined to his
                    natural talents experience of the world, mature judgement, and practice in the
                    art of writing. From these advantages a finished work may be expected; and such,
                    considered as a composition, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom
                        Jones</hi>
               </title> undoubtedly is. There is perhaps no novel in the English
                    language so artfully conducted, or so rich in humour and character. Nor is it
                    without scenes that interest the heart. The story of the highwayman, the
                    distress of Mrs. Miller and her daughter in the affair with Nightingale, and
                    many little incidents relating to Jones in his childhood, are highly affecting,
                    and calculated to awaken our best feelings. Touches of the pathetic thus
                    starting out in a work of humour, do not lose, they rather <pb n="xx"/> gain,
                    from the contrast of sensations, and have a greater air of nature from being
                    mixed with adventures drawn from common life. The conduct of the piece is as
                    masterly as the details are interesting. It contains a story involving a number
                    of adventures, and a variety of characters, all of which are strictly connected
                    with the main design, and tend to the development of the plot; which yet is so
                    artfully concealed, that it may be doubted whether it was ever anticipated by
                    the most practised and suspicious reader. The story contains all that we require
                    in a regular epopea<hi rendition="#sup">

                    unity of design, a change of fortune, a discovery, punishment and reward
                    distributed according to poetical or rather moral justice. The clearing up the
                    character of Jones to Alworthy, the discovery of his relationship to him, and
                    his union with Sophia, are all brought about at the end of the piece, and all
                    obscurities satisfactorily cleared up; so that the reader can never doubt, as in
                    some novels he may, whether the work should have ended a volume before, or have
                    been carried on a volume after, the author's conclusion. The peculiar
                    beauty of the plot consists in this; that though the author's secret is
                    impenetrable, the discovery is artfully prepared by a number of circumstances,
                    not attended to at the time, and by obscure hints thrown out, which, when the
                    reader looks back upon them, are found to agree exactly with the concealed
                    event. Of this nature is the cool unabashed behaviour of Jenny, the supposed
                    delinquent, when she acknow- <pb n="xxi"/> ledges herself the mother of the
                    child; the flitting appearance from time to time of the attorney Dowling; and
                    especially the behavior of Mrs. Blifil to her son, which is wonderfully well
                    managed in this respect. She appears at first to notice him only in compliance,
                    and an ungracious compliance too, with her brother's request; yet many
                    touches of the mother are recollected when the secret is known; and the more
                    open affection she shows him afterwards, when a youth of eighteen, has a turn
                    given it which effectually misleads the reader. If he is very sagacious, he may
                    perhaps suspect some mystery from the frequent appearance of Dowling; but he has
                    no clue to find out what the mystery is, nor can he anticipate the very moment
                    of discovery. </p>
            <p> But intricacy of plot, admirable as this is, is still of secondary merit
                    compared with the exhibition of character, of which there is in this work a rich
                    variety. Of the humorous ones Squire Western and his sister are the most
                    prominent. They are admirably contrasted. He, rough, blunt, and boorish; a
                    country squire of the last century; fond of his dogs and horses; a bitter
                    Jacobite, as almost all the country squires at that time were; and from both
                    causes averse to lords, and London, and every circumstance belonging to a court.
                    She, a staunch whig, a politician in petticoats, valuing herself upon court
                    breeding, finesse, and management, and not disposed, as <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Young</ref> says in one of his satires,
                    "to take her tea without a stratagem."<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> Their opposite though both wrong modes of managing Sophia, <pb n="xxii"/> their mutual quarrels, and the cordial contempt shown for female
                    pretensions on the one side, and country ignorance on the other, are highly
                    amusing. The character of Western is particularly well drawn: he is quite a
                    worldly man, and strongly attached to money, notwithstanding an appearance of
                    jollity and heartiness, which might seem to indicate a propensity to the social
                    feelings. His extreme fondness for Jones, and his total blindness to the passion
                    between him and his daughter, though he had thrown them continually in each
                    other's way, are very natural, and what we see every day exemplified in
                    real life, as well as the astonishment he expresses that a young lady of fortune
                    should think of falling in love with a young fellow without any. Many parents
                    seem by their conduct to think this as impossible as if the two parties were
                    beings of a different species, and they deservedly suffer the consequences of
                    their incautious folly. His fondness for Sophia too, like that of many parents,
                    is very consistent with the most tyrannical behavior to her in points essential
                    to her happiness. His leaving the pursuit of his daughter when he hears the cry
                    of the hounds, in order to join a fox-chase, is very characteristic and
                    diverting. </p>
            <p> It must be admitted that the language and manners of Western have a coarseness
                    which in the present day may be thought exaggerated; and it is to be hoped it
                    would be difficult now to find a breed of country squires quite so unpolished.
                    Perhaps the improvement may be partly owing to their not being so independent
                        <pb n="xxiii"/> as formerly. When they lived insulated, each in his own

                    hypocrite, possessing a mind of thorough baseness and depravity. In characters
                    so contrasted, it is not doubtful to which of them the reader will, or ought to
                    give the preference. To the faults of Blifil the reader has no inclination to be
                    partial. They revolt the mind, particularly the minds of youth. The case is not
                    the same with those more pardonable deviations from morals which are incident to
                    youths of a warm temperament and an impressible heart: these are contagious in
                    their very nature, and therefore the objections which have been made to the
                    moral tendency of this novel are no doubt in some measure just. It is said to
                    have been forbidden in France on its first publication. The faults of Jones are
                    less than those of almost every other person who is brought upon the stage; yet
                    they are of more dangerous example, because they are mixed with so many
                    qualities which excite our affections. Still, his character is of a totally
                    different stamp from the heroes of <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>'s novels. He has an excellent heart and a refined
                    sensibility, though he has also passions of a lower order. In every instance
                    where he transgresses the rules of virtue, he is the seduced, and not the
                    seducer; his youth, his constitution, his unprotected situation after he left
                    Alworthy's, palliate his faults, and in honourable love he is tender and
                    constant. His refusal <pb n="xxv"/> of the young widow who makes him an offer of
                    her hand does him honour. In one instance only is he <hi rendition="#italics">degraded</hi>,—his affair with Lady Bellaston. </p>
            <p> The character of Sophia was probably formed according to the author's ideas
                    of female perfection: she is very beautiful, very sweet-tempered, very fond and
                    constant to her lover; but her behaviour will scarcely satisfy one who has
                    conceived high ideas of the delicacy of the female character. A young woman just

                    the incidents at Upton are highly indelicate. It is observable that <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> uniformly keeps down the
                    characters of his women, as much as <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> elevates his. A yielding easiness of disposition is what
                    he seems to lay the greatest stress upon. Alworthy is made to tell Sophia, that
                    what had chiefly charmed him in her behaviour was the great deference he had
                    observed in her for the opinions of men. Yet Sophia, methinks, had not been
                    extraordinarily well situated for imbibing such reverence. Any portion of
                    learning in women is constantly united in this author with something
                    disagreeable. It is given to Jenny, the supposed mother of Jones. It is given in

               <pb n="xxvi"/>Lady Bellaston displays the ease, good-breeding, and impudence of
                    a town-bred lady of fashion, who has laid aside her virtue. The scene where
                    Jones meets Sophia at her house unexpectedly, the confusion of the lovers, and
                    the civil, sly teasings of Lady Bellaston, are very diverting. Mrs. Miller is a
                    specimen of a natural character given without any exaggeration. She is
                    warm-hearted, overflowing with gratitude, sanguine, and very loquacious. The
                    behavior of Jones in the affair between Nightingale and her daughter does him
                    honour, and he manages the uncle and the father with much finesse. All the
                    characters concerned are well drawn. The family of Black George exhibits natural
                    but coarse painting; they would not be undeserving of a place in <ref target="people.html#CrabbeGeorge">Mr. Crabb</ref>'s parish register.
                    The character of Alworthy is not a shining one; he is imposed upon by every
                    body: this may be consistent with goodness, but it is not consistent with that
                    dignity in which an eminently virtuous character, meant to be exhibited as a
                    pattern of excellence, ought to appear. But <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> could not draw such a
                    character. Traits of humanity and kindness he is able to give in all their
                    beauty; but a religious and strictly moral character was probably connected in
                    his mind with a want of sagacity, which those who have been conversant with the
                    vicious part of the world are very apt to imagine must be the consequence of
                    keeping aloof from it. Besides, it was necessary for the plot that Alworthy
                    should be imposed upon. The character of Alworthy, <pb n="xxvii"/> it is said,

            <p> The discovery of Jones's birth, and his restoration to the favour of
                    Alworthy, wind up the whole, and give an animation to the concluding part, which
                    is apt to become flat in the works of common authors. It is some drawback,
                    however, upon the satisfaction of the reader, that poetic justice cannot be done
                    without giving the good Alworthy the pain of being acquainted with the shame of
                    his sister. It is not natural, when he does know it, that he should needlessly
                    publish a circumstance of that kind, or consider Jones as having the same claims
                    upon him as a legitimate child of his sister's; yet this is what he is made
                    to do. </p>
            <p> Upon the whole, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom Jones</hi>
               </title> is
                    certainly for humour, wit, character, and plot, one of the most entertaining and
                    perfect novels we possess. With regard to its moral tendency we must content
                    ourselves with more qualified praise. A young man may imbibe from it sentiments
                    of humanity, generosity, and all the more amiable virtues; a detestation of
                    meanness, hypocrisy, and treachery: but he is not likely to gain from it
                    firmness to resist temptation, or to have his ideas of moral purity heightened
                    or refined by the perusal. More men would be apt to imitate Jones than would
                    copy <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>; and it is to be feared

                    greater refinement also and delicacy of the present age, a sure test of national
                    civilization, though a very equivocal one of national virtue, has almost
                    proscribed much of that broad humour which appears in the works of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s times, and we
                    should scarcely bear, in a new novel, the indelicate pictures which are
                    occasionally presented to the imagination. The scenes at inns also are coarse,
                    and too often repeated. The introductory chapters ought not to be passed over;
                    they have much wit and grave <ref target="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantic</ref>
                    humour, and occasionally display the author's familiarity with the
                    classics. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s vein was not yet
                    exhausted; he produced a third novel called <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Amelia</hi>
               </title> . If this has less of the author's
                    characteristic humour, it has more scenes of domestic tenderness. Contrary to
                    the usual practice of novel-writers, the story begins after the marriage of the
                    principal personages. The hero, Mr. Booth, is introduced to us in a prison; the
                    distresses of the piece arise from the vicious indulgencies of the husband,
                    combined with unfortunate circumstances; and in the character of Booth, <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> is generally supposed to
                    have delineated his own. Amelia is such a wife as most men of that stamp would
                    deem the model of female perfection, such a one as a man, conscious of a good
                    many frailties and vices, usually wishes for. Faithful, fond, and indulgent, the
                    prospect of immediate ruin cannot draw from her one murmur against her husband,
                    and she willingly sacrifices to him her jewels and every article in her
                    possession. <pb n="xxix"/> Booth is represented as good-natured, thoughtless,
                    and extravagant; passionately fond of his wife, notwithstanding occasional
                    breaches of fidelity to her; and very ready to receive the sacrifices she makes,
                    even to the pawning of her clothes and moveables, for the discharge of his
                    gaming debts. Amelia, indeed, is a heroine of affection and obedience, and the
                    impression upon the reader is certainly that of her being a very amiable and
                    interesting woman; but her character exhibits a great degree of weakness,
                    particularly in her behavior to the nobleman who is endeavouring to seduce her.
                    What woman of any sense could suppose, that a gay nobleman would frequent her
                    house for the sake of amusing himself with her little ones? Her softness and
                    tenderness form a happy contrast with the boldness and daring guilt of Miss
                    Matthews, a character conceived with great strength and spirit. She is a woman
                    handsome and genteelly educated, but leading a life of profligacy, given up to
                    her passions, dangerous; not frail only but wicked. She keeps Booth in unwilling
                    bondage by her threats of disclosing his infidelity to his wife. The history she
                    is made to give of herself is, however, a very dull one. </p>
            <p> The prison scenes are strongly drawn. <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> was well acquainted with rogues and rascals in his judicial,
                    and probably not unfrequently in his private capacity. There is much merit in
                    the delineation of Captain James and his wife, a fashionable couple who are very
                    complaisant without caring for each other. It is an excellent stroke in the
                    character of the lady, that, in the <pb n="xxx"/> midst of her anxiety for her
                    husband, who is supposed to be killed in a duel, she <hi rendition="#italics">recollects</hi> to countermand a rich brocade making up for her at the
                    mantua-maker's. In touches of satire like these <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> excelled. There is
                    something very touching in the humble love of Atkins, which is only revealed
                    when he thinks himself on his death-bed; but the author has not used him very
                    kindly in matching him with so disagreeable a personage as Mrs. Bennet, whose
                    character throughout is thoroughly disgusting, and seems introduced purely to
                    show the author's dislike to learned women. Learning in women may be
                    inimical to some parts of the feminine character, but certainly does not lead to
                    the vices he has given Mrs. Bennet. Probably the coterie of literary and
                    accomplished ladies that generally assembled at his rival's house had its
                    share in fostering this aversion. </p>
            <p> Another character in this work is Colonel Bath, who hides great tenderness of
                    heart under an appearance of fierceness and bluster. He warms his sister's
                    gruel, and is ready to run any man through the body who catches him at the
                    employment. His portrait approaches the caricature. </p>
            <p> A more important personage in the story is the good Dr. Harris; a clergyman,
                    active, friendly and benevolent, with a dash of the humourist. By his means the
                    discovery is brought about that Amelia is entitled to a large estate, which
                    extricates Booth from his difficulties, and brings the story to a happy
                    conclusion. Though <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> in his
                    former works has introduced <pb n="xxxi"/> many clergymen who are held up to
                    ridicule, it is not as clerical but as individual characters, for he was no
                    enemy either to the church or to religion. We certainly cannot conceive of him
                    as a religious man; but he was not from system irreligious. In his characters of
                    Thwackum and Square he has given pretty equal measure to the divine and the
                    philosopher.—There are many good moral maxims in <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Amelia</hi>
               </title>, and much of grave
                    dissertation, but less of humour than in the author’s former works. There are
                    also many tender touches of conjugal affection and domestic feeling. There is no
                    great merit, it is true, on Booth's side in receiving graciously the
                    endearments of a beautiful woman who is always in good humour with him, even
                    when he is most faulty. He is pleased with her; he could not well be otherwise;
                    but he denies himself nothing for her sake or his children's. Yet, faulty
                    as he is, the reader is glad when he is extricated from his distresses. That
                    this should be done by the discovery of a forged will, betrays some poverty of
                    invention, as nearly the same incident is made use of in the <hi rendition="#italics">denouement</hi> of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Tom
                            Jones</hi>
               </title>. </p>
            <p> Upon the whole, though <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Amelia</hi>
               </title> must
                    be acknowledged inferior to the author's other two works, it would
                    establish the reputation of a common writer; and the three together present an
                    exhibition of wit, humour, and character, not easy to be paralleled before or
                    since the time when they were published. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s works are not
                    greatly relished by foreigners; his personages are so truly and
                    characteristically English, that it requires the know- <pb n="xxxii"/> ledge and
                    early associations of a native fully to comprehend them. A Somersetshire esquire
                    is a being as unknown to a Frenchman as a Limosin gentleman is to us. Humour,
                    like some fruits of delicate taste, should be enjoyed on the spot where it is
                    produced. It loses its flavour by being carried abroad. Indeed a foreigner often
                    forms wrong ideas of the manners of a country when he takes them from works of
                    wit and humour, where peculiarities are necessarily dwelt upon and exaggerated;
                    and an Englishman, solicitous for the honour of his country, would not wish that
                    the ideas of its manners should be taken from the works of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>. To himself they are
                    valuable in the same light as the paintings of <ref target="people.html#HogarthWilliam">Hogarth</ref>, which are become curious
                    from exhibiting the modes and dresses of the last century, along with the
                    characteristic manners of the country, and the varied play of those passions and
                    feelings, to delineate which, with spirit and effect, belongs to the observer of
                    human nature in general. </p>
