               subject we treated of works of the imagination that had a moral and useful aim, but
               were not marked by a spirit of fervent patriotism. We now approach a more
               distinctively national class of fictions—romances dictated by hatred of the
               oppressor, and an ardent desire to awaken a love of freedom among the Italians. </p>

               by enlightened Europe. He struggles with the bonds which foreign potenates have

               monuments of the freedom of his country — a stormy liberty it is true, but, even
               thus, being, as liberty ever is, the parent of high virtues, memorable deeds, and
               immortal works of art. He feels that the soil of Tuscany might again be prolific of

            <p>Perhaps no epoch of the history of Florence is more remarkable than that which this
               author has chosen. The <ref target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref>, who had risen
               to the rank almost of princes in the republic, through the joint operation of virtue,
               riches, and sagacity, became, when in the enjoyment of power, a degenerate race.
               During the struggles of the French and Spanish in the Peninsula, they had encountered
               various changes of fortune. When under <ref target="people.html#CharlesV">Charles
                  V.</ref> Rome was sacked, the Florentines took the opportunity to expel the <ref
                  target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref>, and peace was soon patched up between
               the pope <ref target="people.html#ClementVII">Clement</ref> and the emperor, chiefly
               for the purpose, on the part of the former, (who, before he ascended the papal chair,
               was Cardinal <ref target="people.html#ClementVII">Julius de' Medici</ref>,) of
               inducing the latter to turn his arms against the republic, and oblige it, through
               fear or force, to receive back the exiled family as rulers and princes. The heads of
               the family he wished thus to exalt, were indeed such as freemen might disdain. The
               last of the race who deserved respect or love, <ref
                  target="people.html#MediciGiovanni">Giovanni de' Medici</ref>, had died in the
               field of battle. There remained, as chief, <ref target="people.html#MediciAlessandro"
                  >Alessandro</ref>, the natural son of <ref target="people.html#ClementVII"
                  >Julius</ref> himself, by a negro woman; a man bearing the stamp of a base origin
               and brutish race, frightful in person, and depraved in soul. The Florentines detested
               him, and, in truth, hated the whole race of <ref target="people.html#Medici"
                  >Medici</ref>. When summoned by the emperor and pope to yield to receive them as
               rulers, they answered by fortifying their city, gathering what armed force they could
               about them, and resolving to suffer every extremity rather than <pb n="548"/>submit.
               The emperor gave the <ref target="people.html#ChalonPhilibert">Prince of Orange</ref>
               the command over the army sent against them. The siege lasted many months; and in the
               end Florence was lost through the treachery of the Condottiere<note>Mercenaries hired
                  to fight in Italian wars of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries.</note>
               entrusted with its defense.</p>
            <p>Such a period was marked by stirring events, and characterised by men conspicuous for
               virtue or for crime; and it afforded the author of "<title>The Siege of
                  Florence</title>" an ample field for the employment of his genius. His work does
               not consist of a continuous artfully enwoven tale, but of a succession of episodes
               and detached scenes, all bearing upon the same subject, and tending to the same end,
               but distinct from each other in their individual interest. Interspersed with these
               scenes are outbreaks of declamation in the author's own person. He is eloquent and
               energetic, but sometimes bombastic, often obscure, always exaggerated, but never
               affected. He writes with his whole heart; and his words are of fire, though often
               they may strike as being incendiary flames to destroy, rather than regulated heat to
               foster. It requires as much enthusiasm as the author feels in the great cause, not to
               find him at times tedious; but with all this, it is a work of great and lasting
               merit. It is animated by an heroic spirit, and breathes a genuine love of virtue and
               of country. </p>

                  VII.</ref>, and describes him giving audience to a variety of personages, the
               interest awakens. Among these are the ambassadors from Florence, who endeavour to
               mollify his purpose towards his native city. At first the ambassadors speak in
               humility and prayer, till excited by the arrogant assumptions of the pope, one among
               them, Jacopo Guicciardini, brother to the <ref

               eloquent oration, full of spirit and power, denouncing the ambition of <ref
                  target="people.html#ClementVII">Clement</ref>, and declaring the unalterable
               resolution of the republic to maintain its freedom. It is too long to extract, but
               the termination of the scene is characteristic of the style of the author: —</p>
            <quote>
               <p>"Silence!" said the pope, rising from his chair. "A truce to words—too many have
                  already been spoken. Jacopo, your tongue runs on like the waters of a torrent. You
                  place your cause in the hands of God: I also place it there. Let him discern and
                  judge. From the moment we draw the sword, the sword decides the struggle." "You
                  have gathered together all the winds from the north," replied Guicciardini, "to
                  tear the withered foliage from the boughs. Like Pharaoh, you are proud in your
                  horses and soldiery — beware of the Red Sea! God can make the withered leaf as
                  tenacious as the oak of the Alps. The virtuous may appeal to the Almighty under
                  the blows of fortune — the damned exult in the victory of the bad. If any
                  unsearchable decree sometimes exalts the criminal, it is done that he may feel the
                  reverse more bitterly. Tranquil, if not joyous, we confide in the event: for if we
                  conquer, we acquire the fame due to the bold and honourable; and if we fail in our
                  enterprise, the world may call us unfortunate, but still honourable. Do you gaze
                  on the future? — dare to contemplate coming time with open eyes — and say, what
                  thing do you see? We depart free men from the palace, lest, heavy as it is with
                  the wrath of God, it fall upon us. Until now, prayers and entreaties were kindness
                  to our country; now they become slavish and base. The David of <ref

                  to depart—"Stay, Jacopo," cried the pope, "and hear my last words. Let the <ref

                     distinguish themselves through the construction of a tower "with its top in the
                     heavens." God sabotaged the project by creating a confusion in the language of

            <p>The second volume commences with the opening of the Siege of Florence. The country
               around has been ravaged, and various deeds of horror and barbarity are brought before
               the reader. The council of government is held, and an animated scene takes place, in
               which a poor woman makes forcible entry before the Gonfaloniere and the
                  Signoria,<note>The governmental position in charge of maintenance of public order
                  and justice, and the government of the Renaissance Republic of Florence,

               in the cause of the republic. The return of the ambassadors from the pope, and the
               assembly then held, is finely described; and Carduccio, the Gonfaloniere, makes an
               harangue of singular power and eloquence, and the carrying on of war with energy is
               determined upon. The tale then breaks off, so to speak, into various groups of
               episodes. One of the most important is that of <ref target="people.html#MalatestaIV"
                  >Malatesta Baglioni</ref>, the Condottiere to whom the Florentine republic
               entrusted the conduct of the siege and its armies. <ref
                  target="people.html#MalatestaIV">Baglioni</ref> was a traitor, bought by the pope;
               and his endeavours were constantly exerted to prevent any combat of importance, and
               to protract the siege till the treasures of the government, and the patience of the
               citizens, should be exhausted, and the city fall an easy prey to the enemy. The
               author exerts his whole energy to paint in colours sufficiently abhorrent and
               despicable the soul and conduct of the traitor. <ref target="people.html#MalatestaIV"
                  >Baglioni</ref> was the victim of disease; and this physical weakness, joined to
               an unforgotten sense of honour and right, which inspires frequent fits of remorse and
               irresolution in the path of crime, adds to the force of the picture. The author
               places beside him a sort of vulgar <ref target="people.html#Mephistopheles"
                  >Mephistopheles</ref>, who accompanies him throughout, at once exciting his fears,
               and ridiculing and degrading <pb n="550"/>him. A short scene may be given as a
               specimen of his mode of representing these characters. It is night—<ref
                  target="people.html#MalatestaIV">Baglioni</ref> is awake, waiting the return of
               Cencio, whom he had sent to make his bargain with the <ref
                  target="people.html#ClementVII">pope</ref>. His mind presents a thousand images of
               terror and despair: —</p>

                  is close, the horseman alights, enters the Serristori palace, and hurries up the
                  stairs. "That is Cencio—I know his step—he knows too much—he can betray me—he is
                  full to the lips—I must be rid of him—three inches of steel or three drops of
                  poison will send him so far that he will never return. Cencio—O Cencio, my
                  friend!—welcome. I was waiting for you." "Really," said Cencio, throwing himself
                  on a seat, and stretching out his arms and legs with a plebian familiarity, "I am

                  skilful to deceive, he changed that curl into a smile, and, filling a cup of wine,
                  gave it to the other, saying, "Drink, Cencio, and be strengthened—your life is as
                  dear to me as my own." "Alas! Poor wretch that I am, shall I be in time to-morrow
                  to make my will?" "What do you mean, Cencio?" "During the many years, <ref

            <p>There are two love stories in the work, but the author does not excel in depicting
               the tender passion. Generally in reading modern Italian novels, nothing appears so
               dissimilar to our own sentiments and ideas as the portion that treats of love. The
               poets of the old time knew how to describe it, and, as we do, to dress the passion in
               ideality — to deify the object, and invest in glorious and imaginary hues the
               powerful emotions of love. But the modern Italians do not understand this, which must
               partly be attributed to the fact that the system of chivalry never flourished in
               Italy. Women, therefore, were at no time exalted to that height of reverence and
               devotion, which was at once the great use and effect of chivalry. Love, with the
               Italians, is divested of those complicated sentiments with which we associate it.
               Love, with them, is a vehement, engrossing passion, for their natures are vehement.
               It is <pb n="551"/>often true and faithful; but there is always paramount in an
               Italian's mind a sense of the inferiority of women, arising from their physical
               weakness. In the utmost fervour of attachment they still look down on them, and the
               woman or the girl who is described to be in love, is always mentioned with a sort of
               condescending pity, startling to our notions and habits. We find less of this in <ref
                  target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref>. Religon here idealises as
               chivalry does with us. The purity of Lucia, and her superiority over her rustic
               betrothed, exalts her, and the absence of passion in her character gives her dignity;
               but these observations apply to all the novels we have examined above. Ginevra and
               Giacinta, fond and gentle, virtuous, and even noble, as they are, are still pictured
               in a sort of dependant and inferior grade to their lovers. The love stories in the
               present work are contrasted with one another. There is Bandino and Maria Benintendi—a
               tale of misery and treason. They had loved in youth. Bandino was betrayed; Maria,
               persuaded that he was dead, was induced to marry another; even thus married, she
               passes her days in tears, in regret, and lamentation. Bandino — imprisoned as a
               madman, deprived of his birthright, injured in the most grievous manner — is goaded
               by revenge and misery to betray his country, and to join the army against Florence.
               He introduces himself in the disguise of a priest to Maria, and acquaints her that he
               lives. There is a singular instance here of Italian manners. Maria is married, but
               her husband's attachment is not brought forward. There is a youth devotedly in love
               with her, and his tenderness and sufferings are contrasted with the vehement ravings
               of Bandino. While Maria struggles between her duties as a wife, her unchanged and
               passionate attachment for Bandino, and her compassion for her younger and gentler
               lover, Ludovico discovers the treason of Bandino to his native city, and a solemn
               challenge ensues, and at the same period Maria's husband dies. Her terror and grief
               at the anticipation of the duel overcome every other feeling. She visits Ludovico;
               she implores him to abandon his design; and, asserting her past innocence, declares
               her resolution of becoming a nun. She only succeeds in causing her young lover to
               determine to sacrifice himself for her, and to fall that Bandino may be preserved.
               The description of Maria's struggles at this crisis is one of the best written
               passages in the book. Ludovico and his friend are passing out of Florence for the
               purpose of the duel; and, as testimony of its deadly nature, they carry a bier<note>A
                  movable stand on which a corpse or coffin is placed to be carried to its burial
                  site.</note> with them. The unfortunate Maria mixes among the spectators to see
               him pass; Ludovico perceives her, and points with a gesture of despair to the bier.
               Maria, <quote rendition="#noindent">unable to endure that token of desperation,
                  fainted, and fell upon the pavement; recovering, she prostrated herself before the
                  altar of her religion, but altars no longer inspired peace. She knew not for whom
                  to pray—she hesitated to confess to herself which of the two combatants she
                  desired to see victorious. She began an ardent prayer to the Madonna and the
                  saints that the duel might be prevented, but feeling that it would not avail, she
                  broke off: then she began another that Bandino might conquer, and ended it with a
                  supplication for the victory of Ludovico. Mortal heart never before endured so
                  fierce a struggle; yet she felt that peace arose from the depths of her misery —
                  the peace of the tomb perhaps — but still peace. From the incessant comparison she
                  was obliged to make between Ludovico and Bandino, she became convinced of the
                  noble nature of the former and the baseness of the latter. The one, knowing that
                  she loved another, sacrificed his own life to his country and to her; the other,
                  suspecting her fidelity, preserved himself for the purposes of vengeance, and
                  detroyed [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>] her and betrayed his country. The
                  one, having great cause for reproach, never used one word to degrade her, or, did
                  he utter one, it escaped <pb n="552"/>unwittingly from a heart full to the brim.
                  The other, on the contrary, flung infamy by handfuls over her. Other thoughts
                  occurred, and at length her soul appeared to cast off its dark clouds, and to
                  distinguish the moral deformity of Bandino. Through a contradiction peculiar to
                  our nature, the discovery pained her; she wished to replace the bandage which had
                  blinded her, but in vain. The soul, as a bird escaped its cage, shrunk from
                  resuming the bonds of passion. No human mechanist, nor, perhaps, divine one,
                  avails to place again the spiritual yoke, once cast off; neither nature nor art
                  possess a balsam that can cicatrize the wounds of the soul:—Maria did not love
                  Ludovico, but she felt that she abhorred Bandino.</quote>

            <p>There is another love story, meant to be depicted in the simple English style. Vico,
               a son of <ref target="people.html#MachiavelliNiccolo">Machiavelli</ref>, is the hero;
               and a fair Tuscan girl, Annalena, the heroine. This is the weakest part of the book —
               imitative and unreal, the lovers are mere idealities, and take no real hold on the
               imagination. It is in the stronger and nobler passions that the author shines, and in
               which he puts all his soul. Patriotism is the idol on which he exhausts his powers to
               paint it glorious and beautiful. One of his heroes in the earlier portion of the book
               is <ref target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo</ref>, to whose
               simple, but great and fearless character, he renders that justice which has been
               denied by many, who have been led away by the representations of the contemporary
               authors in the pay of the <ref target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref>.<note>The
                  character of <ref target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo</ref>
                  has been traduced; and with an ardour in the cause of virtue worthy of the
                  subject, the author of this work has spared no pains to vindicate him. <ref
                     target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo</ref> was entrusted
                  with the construction of the fortifications of Florence. <ref
                     target="people.html#SismondiJean">Sismondi</ref> says of him, "He seems to have
                  been the more ready to be struck by terror, inasmuch as his imagination was more
                  intensely lively. On the first disasters of Florence he fled to venice — shame
                  caused him to return. When the city fell into the hands of the <ref
                     target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref> he was again assailed by fear, and hid
                  himself." The last act was one of common prudence — he withdrew and concealed
                  himself — while the <ref target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref>, in the first
                  heat of triumph, were taking sanguinary vengeance on their enemies. But the first
                  accusation is a heavy one, though even on the face of it absurd — he fled to
                  Venice for safety; but, ashamed, he returned to share the danger. This accusation
                  rests on the fact that <ref target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo"
                     >Buonarotti</ref> did leave the city at the height of the siege, and did
                  return. The cause of his expedition was unknown even to contemporary authors. It
                  was easy to stigmatise his act as the result of cowardice; and, one author copying
                  from another, <ref target="people.html#SismondiJean">Sismondi</ref> at last added
                  his authority. But fortunately public documents entirely exonerate this great man
                  from every shadow of such baseness. The author of "<title>The Siege of
                     Florence</title>" found contradictions in the old historians, and traces of his
                  being sent from Florence, commissioned by government. At length he found, in an
                  obscure work, allusions to a letter that existed in the Tuscan archives, addressed
                  to Galeotto Giugni, Florentine ambassador at Ferrara, which testified that <ref
                     target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo</ref> had been sent
                  by the Signoria of Florence on a secret commission to Ferrara. The author on this
                  was eager to consult the archives; but the government, jealous of all knowledge
                  and enlightenment, refused him admission to them. Mortified, but not discouraged,
                  he sought for the letter among other collections of papers. "At length," he says,
                  "God had mercy on me; and I will not say how, but I procured a copy of this
                  letter. It runs thus: 'Letter to Galeotto Giugni, ambassador to Ferrara, 28 Feb.
                  1529. <ref target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo
                     Buonarotti</ref> will bear this letter, who is sent by the Nine of the militia
                  to examine those modes of fortifying which his excellency the duke has adopted;
                  and you will do him all possible service with the duke, as his merits deserve, and
                  the interests of the city, for whose benefit he makes this journey.'" The words —
                  those modes of fortifying — are underlined in the original. It is evident from
                  this document that <ref target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo"
                     >Buonarotti</ref> went on a secret mission to the Duke of Ferrara; but, in the
                  subsequent disasters and overthrow of his country, this mission was forgotten, and
                  the cause of the journey being buried in obscurity, an unworthy motive was
                  assigned. In the same way the author defends the great artist from the accusation
                  of flattering the <ref target="people.html#Medici">Medici</ref> in the figures
                  which he sculpted for the tombs of <ref target="people.html#MediciLorenzo"
                     >Lorenzo</ref>, Duke of Urbino, and <ref target="people.html#MediciGiuliano"
                     >Giuliano</ref>, Duke de Nemours — members of that family. He adopts the
                  explanation of Niccolini, who says that <ref target="people.html#MediciLorenzo"
                     >Lorenzo</ref> is made to look sad — because the thoughts of a tyrant, as he
                  approaches death, are full of remorse — and placed the figures of twilight upon
                  the tomb to symbolize the dark shadows slavery cast over life by the tyrants. This
                  view is supported by the answer which <ref
                     target="people.html#BuonarrotiMichelangelo">Michael Angelo</ref> wrote to the
                  verses of <ref target="people.html#Strozzi">Strozzi</ref>, who, speaking of the

                  of simple and high-hearted disdain for vulgar honours. We thank the writer of
                     "<title>The Siege of Florence</title>" for the pains he has taken to illustrate
                  the conduct of this great man. There is no labour at once so meritorious in, and
                  delightful to, an author, as the vindication of the wise and good from calumny and
                  misrepresentation. [Shelley's note]</note> Another favourite personage is Dante
                  <pb n="553"/>Castiglione, whom he draws in forcible colours, as an upright,
               valiant, and noble-hearted soldier. But the real hero of the book is <ref
                  target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Francesco Ferruccio</ref>. In his
                  <title>History of the Italian Republics</title>, <ref
                  target="people.html#SismondiJean">Sismondi</ref> represents this great man as the
               safeguard and hope of Florence. "<ref target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco"
                  >Francesco Ferruccio</ref>," he says, "distinguished himself by his intrepidity
               and his knowledge of war, and gained the confidence of his fellow-citizens, as well
               as the esteem of his enemies. Although the family of Ferrucci was ancient, it was
               poor, and had not produced any distinguished magistrate for many generations. <ref
                  target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Francesco</ref> had served under <ref
                  target="people.html#MediciGiovanni">Giovanni de' Medici</ref>. He was sent by the
               Signoria as commissary-general, first to Prato, and afterwards to Empoli, and after
               having put these towns in a state of defense, he guarded the open country with so
               much success, he so often cut off parties of the enemy, and carried away convoys, and
               maintained such good discipline in his little army, that the soldiers, who loved as
               much as they feared him, believed themselves invincible under his command." This
               great man is successfully delineated in the work before us. A simple-minded
               republican and a brave soldier, his soul is set on saving his country; and danger is
               a plaything in his hands. With a frame of iron he encounters hardship, and with a
               soul equally tempered to endurance, he despises peril. The best passages in the book
               are those which describe his exploits. In his mouth the author puts his own favourite
               theories for Italy. We extract one scene as a specimen of the more imaginative style
               of the author, and of his fervent patriotism. <ref

               troops and preparing for war; one moment of leisure for thought is afforded him:—</p>
            <quote>
               <p>With a countenance cast down, and revolving melancholy thoughts, <ref
                     target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref> walked on the shore of
                  the sea. He turned his steps towards the west, now and then he raised his eyes and
                  sighed, for he found no object that did not renew miserable recollections. To the
                  right he discerned the eminence where the ancient city of Torrita once stood.
                  Noble spirits had once life in her, holy affections had breathed, and beloved
                  memories clung round, exalted by wisdom and greatness; now all lay buried, a thick
                  strata of earth covered them, and a yet denser one of oblivion; even the ruins
                  were vanishing, and time has not left one stone as a monument of the dead city.
                  This disappearance of towns and kingdoms, without one sign being left for
                  posterity; this death of all things, and the absence of all distinction between
                  the annihilation of a people and the withering of the grass under the scythe of
                  the mower, filled the soul of our hero with bitterness. Nor did the view to the
                  left comfort him; there, at a short distance in the sea, existed the monuments
                  which recalled the destruction of one Italian nation by another Italian nation,
                  the terrible battle of Meloria. There Pisa was vanquished by Genoa — O inquitous

                  the vast waters—magnificent elements! At first it recurred to him as if, like
                  rival warriors, they contended as they pursued the pathway of eternity on two
                  infinite parallel lines, and then, afar off, they grow weary of their solitary
                  course, they unite and become confounded, and mingling together, pursue the way
                  still before them, til they reach their bourne. The sea calms its waves, that the
                  sky may behold its own beauty in them; and heaven, returning the fraternal

                  has flamed in its sphere, does it not seem strange as if it deposited it on the
                  bosom of the ocean, to warm it in its turn? Strange thoughts rise up on the shore
                  of the sea, wild perhaps, but ever grand; nor let any one presume to nurse high
                  imaginations, unless they have first beheld this glorious creation of God. If ever

                  through such ideas. Sublime conceptions crowded like inspirations at the thought
                  of Him whom he wished to image so that speech could express, and other minds
                  comprehend, him. Dawn almost beyond himself, he struck his brow, and with eyes
                  fixed on high, exclaimed, "Expand, O Creator! my understanding; my heart feels
                  thee!" Vico Machiavelli approached <ref target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco"

                  he found him lost in thought, and fixing an anxious gaze upon the ocean, as a

                  was to bring him back to her arms. When he touched him, as well as spoke, <ref
                     target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref> looked at him, and
                  spoke: —"Who art thou? Why disturb me in my glorious meditations? Vico—thou here!"
                  and without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Come and be witness for me, that
                  God has revealed to me the means not only of attaining the liberty of my country,
                  but of changing the face of Italy, perhaps of the world. Look beyond there," and
                  he pointed before him; "there is Africa; and turning to the east, almost opposite
                  to Rome, Carthage stood. When the success of <ref target="people.html#Hannibal"
                     >Hannibal</ref> prostrated the Roman power in Italy, our fathers dared
                  undertake the stupendous diversion of carrying the war into Africa. <ref
                     target="people.html#AfricanusScipio">Scipio</ref> changed the destinies of the
                  world; <ref target="people.html#Hannibal">Hannibal</ref> hurried to the succour of
                  his country; courage returned to the Roman eagle, and he soared again to his fatal
                  pitch. Their houses and possessions are dearer to the Signoria of Florence than
                  the freedom of Italy. Fortune rarely favours paltry designs, often bold ones. They
                  have conferred powers that seem ample on me, but burthened with the condition to
                  hasten with all speed to the guard of Florence. Advance, they say, but within the
                  circle that we trace out. Ah! if they had given me liberty to direct my own
                  movements; now, imitating the example of <ref target="people.html#AfricanusScipio"
                     >Scipio</ref>, proceeding with the utmost speed day and night, I would hurry to
                  Rome, and falling on the pope and the cardinals, I would support the doctrines of
                     <ref target="people.html#LutherMartin">Luther</ref>, which now breathe not
                  among the people, but in the palaces of princes. I would ally my cause to that of
                  the German reformers; I would shake the throne of <ref
                     target="people.html#CharlesV">Charles</ref>; I would liberate Italy at once
                  from her spiritual and temporal yoke; I would rebuild the Capitol, and resucitate
                  the Roman people. Alas, this thought kills me! I must forget it. Let us shut
                  ourselves up in Florence, and keep alive the lamp, since its extinction is
                  threatened. Danger is there, and there also glory."</p>

            <p>It is historically true, that <ref target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco"
                  >Ferruccio</ref> had contemplated carrying the war to Rome, and it is true in all

               triumphed in Italy, that country had, at the crisis it had reached, been raised to

               his troops toward Florence; and, during the march, fell on the field of battle, a
               victim of the treachery of <ref target="people.html#MalatestaIV">Baglioni</ref>. The
               plan of the Signoria was prudent and well contrived, con-<pb n="555"/>sisting in a

               from without on the camp of the <ref target="people.html#ChalonPhilibert">Prince of
                  Orange</ref>, and a sally from the city. Had this plan been executed, the republic
               had been saved, but <ref target="people.html#MalatestaIV">Baglioni</ref> betrayed the
               councils of his employers; he informed the <ref target="people.html#ChalonPhilibert"
                  >Prince of Orange</ref> of the advance of <ref
                  target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref>, and advised him to go
               with his whole army to meet him, promising that no attack should meanwhile be made on
               his unguarded camp. This last treachery sealed the fate of the republic. The <ref
                  target="people.html#ChalonPhilibert">Prince</ref> came upon <ref
                  target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref> unexpectedly, during his
               march to Pistoia; the battle was for some time dubious; the <ref
                  target="people.html#ChalonPhilibert">Prince of Orange</ref> fell; but succour
               coming up for his troops, the army of the Republic was utterly vanquished and
               dispersed, and <ref target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref> himself
               slain. The facts of this memorable day are so full of grandeur and heroism, that the
               simplest account is the most interesting. The fault of the author of the siege of
               Florence is an incapacity to compress; he never knows when he has done enough; but in
               the pages that recount the death struggles of Italian liberty, there is much
               eloquence, much power, much deep and genuine feeling. With the fall of <ref
                  target="people.html#FerruccioFrancesco">Ferruccio</ref>, Florence fell; the
               treason of <ref target="people.html#MalatestaIV">Baglioni</ref> triumphed; and,
               unresisted, the troops of the pope made themselves masters of the city. Certain
               conditions were in appearance agreed upon; all of which were afterwards broken. The
               work ends by a sketch of the result of the fall of Florence, and of the fate of the
               survivors of the struggle. The author heaps infamy and misery on the heads of the
               traitors, and on the patriots adversity and honour. </p>
            <p>It will be gathered from this sketch that the subject of the work is full of
               grandeur, and certain portions of it exhibit considerable talent. Many of the scenes
               are replete with interest, and sustained with energy. His eloquence is great,
               elevated by a fervent enthusiasm; but his style is exaggerated, diffuse, and even
               obscure; his various episodes are not sufficiently interwoven, several of them being
               superfluous, and the whole too long drawn out. </p>
            <p>"<title>The Battle of Benevento</title>," a romance, by <ref
                  target="people.html#GuerrazziFD">Doctor Guerazzi</ref>, a Livornese lawyer, bears
               a similarity in its style to "<title>The Siege of Florence</title>." It is not so
               openly inimical to the tyrants of Italy, nor is it the subject of such recent
               interest, being derived from the old times of Naples as far back as the thirteenth
               century. It is conceived, however, in a truly patriotic spirit, and abounds with
               passages that evince the author's desire to instruct and improve his countrymen. The
               great and exact knowledge which the work displays of the history and customs of the
               times in which the story is laid, places it high in the esteem of the Italians. With
               us this produces effects that injure the interest. Many long chapters are purely
               historical, which, though well written, may be called dry to the mere novel reader.
               Besides this drawback, the writer will sacrifice incident and character to the
               development of manners in a scene, or to the enunciation of his peculiar view and
               opinions. He does not hesitate to be long-winded, to introduce episodes that have no
               immediate connection with the story; his hero is thus reduced to a nonentity, and the
               interest flags. But the style is elegant, and the matter good. The battle of
               Benevento was that in which fell <ref target="people.html#Manfred">Manfred</ref>,
               grandson of <ref target="people.html#BarbarossaFrederick">Frederic Barbarossa</ref>,
               and which placed <ref target="people.html#CharlesIAnjou">Charles of Anjou</ref> on
               the throne of Naples. We regret that <ref target="people.html#GuerrazziFD"
                  >Guerazzi</ref> has not done more justice to the character of <ref
                  target="people.html#Manfred">Manfred</ref>. He founds his description of him on
               the accounts given by the writers of the Guelph party, who loaded with infamy a
               sovereign excommunicated by the church; but we are partial to a prince whom <ref
                  target="people.html#Dante">Dante</ref> speaks of with respect and affection, and
               who was acknowledged to be of a noble and magnanimous disposition, while we dislike
               his hard-hearted and bigoted rival. This romance does less credit to its author as
               the inventor of an original story, than as an eloquent writer, a deep <lb/><fw type="sig">

               heart. </p>
            <p>There are other romances, but the above named are of the most note. <ref
                  target="people.html#RosiniGiovanni">Rosini</ref>, who continued, with strange
               rashness, the episode of "Gertrude," in the "<title>Promessi Sposi</title>," and
               wrote "<title>Luisa Strozzi</title>," is not destitute of merit; but it is laborious
               to read him. He is a great admirer of our <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel"
                  >Richardson</ref>, and imitates him in the minuteness of his details, and the
               long-windedness of his narrative; but the deep interest we take in <ref
                  target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>'s novels not only results
               from his admirable fidelity to nature, but from his taking the manners of our own
               country and times as his groundwork. These minutiæ, set down as appertaining to
               historical romances, are inexpressibly tiresome and uninteresting. </p>
            <p>The Italians have no novels — no tales relating to the present day, and detailing
               events and sentiments such as would find counterparts in the histories and minds of
               themselves and their friends. Many reasons may be given for this. The actual state of
               manners could never be detailed: the Italians would be so scandalized if the mirror
               were held up to themselves. <ref target="people.html#GoldoniCarlo">Goldoni</ref>'s
               plays are the nearest approach they could bear to reality; and these, though
               admirable as far as they go, often sink into childishness, from the restrictions the
               author lies under as to faithfulness of portraiture in the darker shades of society.
               The real events of an Italian's life are the last that could be openly avowed.
               Another impediment lies in the impossibility of delineating the influence exercised
               by the priests; which in all cases is very great, and too often pernicious. Yet could
               a clever Italian give us only a <ref target="people.html#AustenJane">Miss
                  Austen</ref> sort of view of domestic life in that country, it would afford great
               amusement and instruction. We recommend this hint to <ref
                  target="people.html#RosiniGiovanni">Signor Rosini</ref>. His love of minutiæ would
               no longer repel us, if he were only bold enough to put down even half the truth. </p>
            <p>To return, however, to the subject of our article — the romances of modern Italy. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#MazziniGuiseppe">Mazzini</ref> tells us that the school of
                  <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> is that of Christianity,
               while the writers who aim at the recognition of Italy incline to free thinking. The
               contradictions which, according to this view, these several classes of thinkers fall
               into is worthy of comment. A devoted patriot cannot be devoid of religion. His
               desires not having their fulfilment in this life, he looks beyond; and when the
               tyrant prospers, he looks to God to balance the unequal scales of right and wrong;
               and, by making virtue the highest happiness, though he may be condemned to poverty or
               exile for political crimes eternally dishonourable to their perpetrator, even when he
               triumphs, he brings a power from beyond the visible creation, to exalt and to debase.
               On the other hand, the spirit that <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro"
                  >Manzoni</ref> and <ref target="people.html#PellicoSilvio">Silvio Pellico</ref>
               would inspire is contrary to that which animated the Saviour in his career. He
               forgave his enemies, but he appealed against them—he suffered on the cross, rather
               than abandon the teaching of the doctrines that were to redeem the world—he enforced
               with the apostles the necessity of going abroad, to increase proselytes and overthrow
               the old systems of tyranny and wrong. When he gave to <ref
                  target="people.html#CaesarJulius">Cæsar</ref> the things that were <ref
                  target="people.html#CaesarJulius">Cæsar</ref>'s, he did not give obedience to the
               authorities that bade him cease to disseminate his doctrines. Let the well-wishers of
               Italy attempt to follow this divine example in all its devotion and sincerity, and
               they will cease to inculcate passive obedience. Could any sincerely religious
               reformer animate the Italians with true piety, and shake the power of the priesthood,
               Italy might be regenerated; as it is, the lower orders are the slaves of the Church,
               while the upper classes are either real or affected un-<pb n="557"/>believers; and
               neither of them consider truth, charity, and integrity, as the beginning and end of
               life.</p>
            <p>The better portion of the people of Italy are eager for instruction; they are a
               quick-witted and sagacious people. Italian authors are called to the sacred task of
               enlightening their fellow-men. No writers of other nations can do this, for they
               cannot sufficiently understand the spirit of the people to address their hearts and
               imaginations. It must be left to Italians to teach Italians, and the good name of the
               writers with posterity will depend on their not betraying nor growing weary in the
               sacred task of enlightening their countrymen, and drawing their minds from the abyss
               of ignorance and slavery in which they are now sunk. Were their souls emancipated
               from vice, the Austrian could not long enslave their bodies.</p>
            <p>The Austrian, indeed, since the death of the "beloved <ref
                  target="people.html#FrancisII">Francis</ref>," has shown a spirit of humanity
               which does honour to the new emperor. It is to be hoped that the scenes of the
               dungeons of Spielburgh<note>Špilberk is a castle in the present-day Czech Republic.
                  Originally used as a prison for protestants, Špilberk became the harshest prison
                  for opponents of the Austrian Empire.</note> are never to be renewed, nor modern
               history blotted by a repetition of crimes, which we almost deemed fabulous when
               recorded of Venice and the Inquisition. Men whose sole crime is a love of country
               will not again be condemned to punishment worse than death, taken in the enjoyment of
               youth and glowing with an ardour for virtue; and rendered, through a long course of
               solitary confinement, bad food, and tedious unnatural labour, cripples in body, while
               their souls, losing their energy and fervour, they become the willing slaves of their
               cruel oppressor, and call the tameness produced by physical suffering
               Christianity.</p>
            <p>Besides the subsiding of the active spirit of persecution which desolated so many
               Italian families, there is another hope for that country. One corner of it is
               emancipated from both Austrian and priest. The citizens of Ancona, having thrown off
               their obedience to the pope, govern themselves. Their state of enmity with the papal
               see may serve to loosen them from an adherence to Catholicism; and it is to be hoped
               that a purer religion will spring up in its stead. When the pope's bull of
               excommunication arrived at Ancona, the citizens fastened it to a fire balloon, with a
               writing appended, "Give to heaven what belongs to heaven," and sent the blasphemous
               curse to float among the storms of air, till it might fall in the sea, and be blotted
               out for ever. The pope is very eager to prevent any communication between the
               Anconese and the rest of his subjects; but when, as is projected for the sake of
               commerce with Greece, a railroad is constructed between Leghorn and Ancona, the
               spirit of liberty in the latter will at once become more diffused and confirmed, and
               its walls will at least afford a refuge to those Italians who love their native soil,
               and yet yearn for the rights of freemen. <lb/><fw type="sig">
