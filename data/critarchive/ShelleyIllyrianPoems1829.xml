            <p rendition="#noindent"><hi rendition="#largest">S</hi>EVERAL years ago, the "Comedies
               de Clara Gazul" appeared in Paris, and excited a great deal of attention. They were
               hardly less known and praised in England. It was<pb n="72"/>soon understood that they
               were imitations of the Spanish drama, the production of a very young Frenchman, (<ref
                  target="people.html#MerimeeProsper">M. Merimée</ref>) and that "Clara Gazul" was
               altogether a fictitious personage. They were, in every way, striking and interesting
               productions, possessing at once the faults and beauties of their models, full of
               spirit, originality, and fire. They were introduced by an account of their feigned
               authoress, which, as well as the dramas themselves, is remarkable for its utter
               freedom from affectation. There are to be found in them none of those defects, too
               generally attributed with justice to French imaginative works: there is no
               circumlocution, no parade, and their very hyperbole, as being common to the Spanish
               drama, is natural and in its place. The first of these comedies is founded on a
               circumstance that occurred during the last war; when a woman, brought up in infamy,
               was bribed to spy and betray, through their officers, a Spanish detachment to the
               French authorities in Finland. The gradual softening and repentance of the girl, when
               she discovers the worth, and learns to love the man she is about to lead to the
               scaffold, contrasted with the obduracy of her mother, is finely drawn; and the scene
               in which she confesses her guilt to her lover is touching from its simplicity and
               truth. Energy is the characteristic of these pieces, mingled with a display of
               knowledge in the lighter touches of humanity; such as the sweet gracefulness of Iñez,
               and the struggles between a Catholic woman's religion and her love in "Le Ciel et
               l'Enfer." This drama is one of the best in the book; it is founded on the stormy
               passion of jealousy, the most terrible and selfish of human emotions, and the most
               interesting, from its being the most universal. As Clara Gazul was a Liberal,
               inquisitors and priests are attacked in her productions, and there reigns through all
               of them the spirit of freedom from political and religious servitude.</p>
            <p>The author's next work was in a very different style, resembling the first in one
               particular only, that it is an imitation. It is entitled the "Guzla," and imports to
               be a translation of a collection of Illyrian national poems. We have in the preface
               some account of the players on the Guzla (a single-stringed guitar) and their mode of
               reciting to music, much in the manner of the Italian <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >improvisatori</hi>. <note>During her travels in Italy, <ref
                     target="people.html#ShelleyMary">Mary Shelley</ref> developed a strong interest
                  in improvisational poets like <ref target="people.html#Sgricci">Tommaso
                     Sgricci</ref>.</note> We are introduced also to an imaginary person, Hyacinth
               Maglanovich, who is supposed to be the author of the greater number of the poems in
               the volume before us. They are warlike, pathetic, and amatory—and, above all,
               whatever is their theme, they are characterized by the utmost simplicity, while a
               vein of sweetness runs throughout, that lends to each a particular charm. By a strong
                  effort<pb n="73"/>of the imagination, the young Parisian writes as if the
               mountains of Illyria had been the home of his childhood; the rustic and barbarous
               manners are not softened, nor the wild energy of the people tamed; and, if we trace
               any vestige of civilization, it merely arises from the absence of all that would
               shock our tastes or prejudices. We are induced to give a few specimens from this
               extraordinary production, glad of an opportunity to introduce it to the lovers of
               poetry in this country.</p>
            <p>We select, in the first place, a love poem, entitled, "The Beloved of Dannisich." To
               render it intelligible, we are informed in a note, that the Illyrian girl is in the
               habit of receiving gifts from her various suitors, and that after she has collected a
               sufficient number, her chosen lover requests permission to carry her off; and she
               consenting, always names the place and hour for flight.</p>

                  thee.' </p></quote>
            <p>Another of the poems is founded on the oaths of friendship which it is usual for the
               Illyrian warriors to take one with the other. Two men thus united are called <hi
                  rendition="#italics">Pobratimi</hi>,<note>Serbo-Croatian: blood brothers.</note>
               or half brothers; they often sacrifice their lives for each other, and any quarrel
               between them is as scandalous as if, among us, a son ill-treated his father. </p>

                  the hand of his brother. Since that day the bey Janco drinks neither spirits nor

                  prayed lying on the pavement with outspread arms, shedding bitter tears. But when
                  the night came, he returned home, he appeared calmer, and he supped, waited on by
                  his wife and children.</p><p rendition="#center">6.</p><p>When he was in bed, he
                  called his wife and said, "Can'st thou see the church of Perrussich from the

                  covered with mist, and I can see nothing beyond it." The bey Janco said, "Good;
                  rest again beside me;" and he prayed in his bed for the soul of Cyril Pervan.

                  "Open the window and look again towards Perrussich." His wife immediately arose
                  and said, "Beyond the Morpolatza, in the midst of the mist, I see a pale and
                  flickering light." Then the bey smiled and said, "Good; lie down again;" and he
                  took his rosary and continued to pray. </p><pb n="75"/><p rendition="#center"

                  light in the middle of the river, which is advancing rapidly hither." Then she
                  heard a deep sigh, and something fell on the floor. The bey Janco was
               dead.</p></quote>
            <p>Another poem is founded on the superstition attached to an evil eye, which,
               whomsoever it looks on, it kills. There are various kinds of evil eyes, one consists
               in having two pupils in each eye. </p>

                  rose on tiptoe, she opens the window, and a tall youth is seated on the ground,

                  he replied:—"We shall be more at our ease to-night at my home; there are satin

            <p>One of the most interesting parts of this book is an account of Vampyrism, and a
               detail of the death of a girl, the victim of a vampire. But the above specimens are
               sufficient to recommend it to the reader; and every lover of nature in its wildness
               and its freedom, will find pleasure in these emanations of a mind, imbued with grand
               and unsophisticated imagery, true as the echo in giving back the voice of the
               imaginative and simple mountaineer.</p>
            <p>The last production of this <ref target="people.html#MerimeeProsper">author</ref>,
               recently published, is now before us. It is ushered in as no imitative attempt. "La
               Jaquerie" consists of a series of dramatic scenes, developing the history of an
               insurrection in France, almost contemporary with those in our own country which
               occurred under Richard II. The author observes in his short preface, that similar
               tumults broke out almost at the same time in France, Flanders, England, and the north
               of Germany. They all arose from the same cause:—the peasantry, long trampled on by
               the iron heel of feudal tyranny, endured such matchless privations and cruelties,
               that in spite of the prejudices that degraded them in their own eyes, beneath the
               rank of their fellow men; in spite of the arms and strongholds of their adversaries,
               they rose against them, and loosened, though they could not break, their feudal
               chains. The plan of the author of "La Jaquerie" is, to give a faithful picture of the
               manners of those times, bringing together under one point of view the many and
               successive scenes and personages that formed the then state of society. A history
               written with this view would develop a new and terrible page of human experience. To
               present this to us in the form of dialogue merely is a difficult undertaking;
               individual character is lost in the infinite variety of persons made to pass before
               us, and we have the ideal instead of the real being presented to us. We are
               introduced to the factious priest, murmuring because, in the choice of an abbot, the
               monks prefer the noble blood of another to his learning. We have the knights of
               France, whose very names awaken all the delusive associations of romance; the English
               captains of adventurers, whose trade was war; the burgess grasping and cowardly; the
               robber driven to outlawry by the cruelty of his superiors, and nourishing vengeance
               as a duty; the peasant first sinking beneath, and then rising to throw off
               oppression; and finally the lord of the castle, the feudal<pb n="79"/>chief, the
               suzerain of the surrounding country, his daughter and her betrothed lover, and the
               baron's men at arms, who though, in the language of the day, a villain, joins the
               gifts of poetry to those of valour. </p>
            <p>These scenes may be divided into three parts. The first consisting of a development
               of the causes that led to rebellion. The picture of arbitrary power, unsoftened by
               any tinge of humanity, is frightful and true; ingratitude, pride, and cruelty
               exercised over the poor and unarmed, produce at last hatred and desire of vengeance:
               the peasantry, incited to open rebellion by a priest, rise in arms: they take a band
               of English adventurers into their pay, they besiege the castle of their lord, march
               to Beauvais, which, admitted by the lower orders, they take and sack, defeat the
               regular forces sent against them, and spread terror and devastation around. The lord
               of Apremont defends himself long, and is willing to endure any extremity, rather than
               submit to his rebellious vassals. Among these is one, late a favourite in the castle,
               Pierre, the minstrel and the man at arms. He had saved the life of the lady Isabel,
               and her father bestowed him on her as her page. Her beauty awakens, her gracious
               kindness fosters, his love, and he dared hope. Called on by her in an hour of ennui,
               to recite a tale for her amusement, he feigns to read one in which a noble girl
               becomes the bride of a serf. She discovers the deceit and guesses the cause—she
               dismisses him from the castle with blighting disdain, while his temerity even
               degrades her in her own eyes. Pierre is seized on by the grand mover of the plot, the
               monk, who gives him hope of triumph, and a chance of winning his lady, if he should
               join the insurgents, and he is now the chief of those who besiege the castle. Poor
               Isabel, her father wounded, every hope lost, asks her betrothed to give her back her
               faith, and then offers herself a sacrifice to Pierre, if he will save her parent. The
               end is tragical—he is too generous to accept the victim, and endeavours to provide
               for the escape of her and her family; but the miseries of civil discord in all its
               most hideous results, envelope the fugitives in one mighty ruin. The peasantry are
               victorious, and now begins the third part of the drama, their downfall—schism among
               themselves, a wish to return to their native fields and humble homes, a confidence in
               the word of their enemies, an incapacity to submit to discipline, joined to the
               treachery of their English allies, bring on the catastrophe. Such is a slight sketch
               of the progress of these scenes. We feel the want of one prominent character to
               concentrate the interest, without which a dramatic composition is never perfect. But
               the author has not aimed at a regular tragedy, and he has succeeded in giving us
                  in<pb n="80"/>a series of interesting scenes, a forcible picture of the manners of
               our ancestors, and of the crimes and misfortunes resulting from the feudal system,
               from which our state of civilization preserves us.</p>
            <p>To the "Jaquerie" is added a drama, entitled the "Family of Carvajal." This is a
               tremendous domestic tragedy, founded on the same story as the Cenci.<note><ref

                     Cenci</ref>, was published in 1819.</note> In this production the author is no
               longer a painter of manners only, but he becomes a depict of passion, an observer and
               a narrator of the secret motives that influence our nature, and the dread events that
               are the result of unlawful indulgence. It is a question whether certain combinations
               of circumstances, though it is allowed that they have existence, should be recalled
               to our memory and represented to our imaginations. But it is difficult for the
               author, whose impulse is a gift of his nature, whose talent is spontaneous, who can
               no more repress the yearning of his mind to trace the boundaries of the unknown
               intellectual world, than he can rule the pulsations of his heart; it is difficult for
               him to submit to rules imposed by those whose tamer thoughts never emerge from the
               narrow bounds of their personal experience; who repose in a windless atmosphere, and
               who fear to have their downy slumbers broken by the war of elements. Columbus,
               anticipating the discovery of the unknown shores that pale our western progress over
               the wild and distant waves of the Atlantic, felt the old world, extended in latitude
               and longitude so far and wide, a narrow prison—and thus the imaginative writer, who
               deems that beyond the usual track he may find a fresh and untried ground,
               courageously launches forth, leaving the dull every-day earth behind him. If his
               discoveries do not interest us, do not let us vituperate his adventurous spirit, and
               thus degrade ourselves to the level of all detractors from the fame attendant on
               intellectual enterprise. Let us remember that the poets of Greece, whose names are as
               a part of our religion, and the highly-gifted dramatists of our own country, have
               been prone to select as subjects for their tragedies, events grounded on the direst
               passions and the worst impulses.</p>
            <p>The Family of Carvajal has given rise to these reflections: they may be received as
               applying to every similar production which seeks to interest by new and strange
               combinations, and which are vivid in their conception and strong in their delineation
               of what they only know through the innate force of the imagination. The author before
               us has shewn no lack of boldness in his treatment of the subject, while he has never
               overstepped those boundaries which must be observed for our tastes not to be shocked,
               instead of our interest excited. He has made the<pb n="81"/>father and daughter
               equally impetuous and resolute, but one is the oppressor, the other the victim. The
               scene is laid in an unpopulated province of New Granada, and the father is
               represented as a despot over his wife, a cruel tyrant to his slaves, a man grown old
               in crime. His hapless daughter was brought up in a rustic semi-barbarous convent, and
               she returns home to find herself an associate of guilt, to which her proud heart
               refuses to yield, while love for another adds to her vehemence and misery. This
               meeting of two fierce natures in unnatural discord presents a new and terrible source
               for dramatic interest. Each scene transcends the one before in its appalling horror;
               and the last, in which the miserable girl poignards her father, completes the dark
               picture, spreading over the canvas the lurid hues of whirlwind and volcano. We turn
               trembling from the contemplation, while we confess the force of the genius that
               presents it to our eyes.</p>
