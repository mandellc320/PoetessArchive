                    point out the beauties of <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs
                        Inchbald</ref>'s novels. <title>The <hi rendition="#italics">Simple
                            Story</hi></title> has obtained the decided approbation of the best
                    judges. There is an originality both in the characters and the situations which
                    is not often found in similar productions. To call it a <hi rendition="#italics">simple story</hi> is perhaps a misnomer, since the first and second parts
                    are in fact two distinct stories, connected indeed by the character of
                    Dorriforth, which they successively serve to illustrate. </p><p> Dorriforth is introduced as a Romish priest of a lofty mind, generous, and
                    endued with strong sensibilities, but having in his disposition much of
                    sternness and inflexibility. His being in priest's orders presents an
                    apparently insurmountable obstacle to his marriage; but it is got over, without
                    violating probability, by his becoming heir to a title and estate, and on that
                    account receiving a dispensation from his vows. Though slow to entertain
                    thoughts of love, as soon as he perceives the partiality of his ward, it enters
                    his breast like a torrent when the flood-gates are opened. The perplexities in
                    which he is involved by Miss Milner's gay unthinking conduct bring them to
                    the very brink of separating for ever; and very few scenes in any novel have a
                    finer effect than the intended parting of the lovers, <lb/><fw type="vol"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. xxviii.</hi></fw><fw type="sig">a</fw><pb n="ii"/>and their sudden,
                    immediate, unexpected marriage. </p><p> It is impossible not to sympathize with the feelings of Miss Milner, when she
                    sees the corded trunks standing in the passage; or again, when after their
                    reconciliation she sees the carriage, which was to take away her lover, drive
                    empty from the door. The character of the ward of Dorriforth is so drawn as to
                    excite an interest such as we seldom feel for more faultless characters. Young,
                    sprightly, full of sensibility, gay and thoughtless, we feel such a tenderness
                    for her as we should for a child who is playing on the brink of a precipice. The
                    break between the first and second parts of the story has a singularly fine
                    effect. We pass over in a moment a large space of years, and find every thing
                    changed: scenes of love and conjugal happiness are vanished; and for the young,
                    gay, thoughtless, youthful beauty, we see a broken-hearted penitent on her
                    death-bed. </p><p> This sudden shifting of the scene has an effect which no continued narrative
                    could produce; an effect which even the scenes of real life could not produce;
                    for the curtain of futurity is lifted up only by degrees, and we must wait the
                    slow succession of months and years to bring about events which are here
                    presented close together. The death-bed letter of Lady Milner is very solemn,
                    and cannot be perused without tears. </p><p> Dorriforth in these latter volumes is become, from the contemplation of his
                    injuries, morose, unrelenting, and tyrannical. How far it was possible for a man
                    to resist the strong impulse of nature, and deny himself the sight of his <pb n="iii"/>child residing in the same house with him, the reader will
                    determine; but the situation is new and striking. </p><p> It is a particular beauty in <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs.
                        Inchbald</ref>'s compositions, that they are thrown so much into the
                    dramatic form. There is little of mere narrative, and in what there is of it,
                    the style is careless; but all the interesting parts are carried on in
                    dialogue:—we see and hear the persons themselves; we are but little led to
                    think of the author, and it is only when we have done feeling that we being to
                    admire. </p><p> The only other novel which Mrs. <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs.
                        Inchbald</ref> has given to the public is <title><hi rendition="#italics">Nature and Art</hi></title>. It is of a slighter texture than the
                    former, and put together without much attention to probability; the
                    author's object being less to give a regular story, than to suggest
                    reflections on the political and moral state of society. For this purpose two
                    youths are introduced, one of whom is educated in all the ideas and usages of
                    civilized life; the other (the child of Nature) without any knowledge of or
                    regard to them. This is the frame which has been used by Mr. Day and others for
                    the same purpose, and naturally tends to introduce remarks more lively than
                    solid, and strictures more epigrammatic than logical, on the differences between
                    rich and poor, the regard paid to rank, and such topics, on which it is easy to
                    dilate with an appearance of reason and humanity; while it requires a much
                    profounder philosophy to suggest any alteration in the social system, which
                    would not be rather Utopian than beneficial. </p><pb n="iv"/><p> There is a beautiful stroke in this part of the work, where Henry, who,
                    according to Rousseau's plan, had not been taught to pray till he was of an
                    age to know what he was doing, kneels down for the first time with great
                    emotion; and on being asked if he was not afraid to speak to God, says, "To
                    be sure I trembled very much when I first knelt, but when I came to the words
                    'Our Father who art in heaven,' they gave me courage, for I know how
                    kind a father is." </p><p> But by far the finest passage in this novel is the meeting between Hannah and
                    her seducer, when he is seated as judge upon the bench, and, without
                    recollecting the former object of his affection, pronounces sentence of death
                    upon her. The shriek she gives, and her exclamation, "Oh, not from
                    you!" electrifies the reader, and cannot but stir the coldest feelings. </p><p> Judgement and observation may sketch characters, and often put together a good
                    story; but strokes of pathos, such as the one just mentioned, or the dying-scene
                    in <ref target="people.html#OpieAmelia">Mrs. Opie</ref>'s <title><hi rendition="#italics">Father and Daughter</hi></title>, can only be
                    attained by those whom nature has endowed with her choicest gifts. </p><p> One cannot help wishing the author had been a little more liberal of happiness
                    to poor Henry, who sits down contented with poverty and his half-withered
                    Rebecca. </p><p> There is another wish the public has often formed, namely, that these two
                    productions were not the <hi rendition="#italics">only</hi> novels of such a
                    writer as <ref target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs. Inchbald</ref>. </p></div></body></text></TEI>
