               </hi>, the
					first English author who has given celebrity to the modern novel, was born in
					the year 1689, at some place in Derbyshire, but in what particular town is not
					known, as he, from some reason or other, always avoided mentioning the place of
					his birth. This reserve could not well spring from a desire of concealing the
					obscurity of his origin, since he has himself freely mentioned it in his letters
					to his friends. His father was a joiner, ingenious in his profession, and
					respectable in his character. He was in flourishing business in London, and much
					noticed, says his son, by the <ref target="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">duke
						of Monmouth</ref>, after whose defeat and death he thought it expedient to
					retire into the country, which was the occasion of his settling in Derbyshire;
					and there our author spent the early years of his life. He was at first intended
					for the church, for which profession he was well suited by his seriousness and
					love of letters; but his father having a numerous family, and being, besides, in
					declining circumstances, was not able to allow him a liberal education. Though
					he did not go to business till sixteen, <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">g 2</fw>
               <pb n="ii"/>it is probable he enjoyed very slender
					advantages of school-learning. Some of his admirers have wished to raise his
					character by affirming that he possessed a knowledge of the classics; but his
					own assertions are frequent in his letters, that he was acquainted with no
					language but his own, not even French. His deficiencies in this respect he often
					lamented, and it is certain his style is as remote as possible from that of a
					scholar. It abounds with colloquial vulgarisms, and has neither that precision
					nor that tincture of classic elegance which is generally the result of an early
					familiarity with the best models. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was however always fond of reading, and still more of
					narrating. Some anecdotes are preserved in his letters which show very strongly
					the early bent of his genius. It appears that he was not fond of the usual
					amusements of boys, but used very early to exercise his invention by gathering
					his schoolfellows round him, and telling them affecting stories; and he then
					wrote "A little history of a servant man who was preferred by a young lady
					to a great lord who was a libertine."<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note>In a popular ballad, a respectable serving man named Thomas
							a Pott is preferred by the daughter of Lord Arrndell over the libertine
							Lord Phenix.</note>
               </hi> All his stories, he tells us, had a good moral;
					they were not stories of genii and fairies, but of life, and probably of low
					life. It was indeed a peculiarity in him, that he was fond of two things which
					boys in general have rather an aversion to; letter-writing, and the company of
					the other sex. At the early age of thirteen he was a favourite with all the
					girls in the neighbourhood who were fond of books. He used to read to them as
					they sat at work with their needles; he also was <pb n="iii"/>the confident of
					their secrets, and wrote or corrected their love-letters for them. Even before
					that age he had written an anonymous letter of grave advice to an elderly widow
					lady. Who does not see that his most admired works are only the expansion of
					those talents which in the germ prompted his earliest efforts? </p>
            <p> Human nature is human nature in every class: the hopes and the fears, the
					perplexities and the struggles, of these low-bred girls, in probably an obscure
					village, supplied the future author with those ideas which, by their gradual
					development, produced the characters of a <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>

               </hi>.âIn the mean time years went on; and it being
					incumbent on him to fix on some business, as his father could not bring him up
					to a profession, he chose that of a printer, chiefly, as he informs us, because
					he thought it would gratify his thirst for reading; and he was bound apprentice
					to <ref target="people.html#WildeJohn">Mr. Wilde</ref> of Stationers' Hall
					in the year 1706. He did not however find it easy to gratify this thirst, though
					the stream ran by his lips. He served a severe master, and was obliged, greatly
					to the injury of his constitution, to steal his reading from the hours of rest
					and relaxation; and so conscientious was he, that on these occasions he always,
					as he informs us, purchased his own candle. He was at the same time so diligent
					in his proper business that his master used to call him the pillar of his house. </p>
            <p> After the expiration of his apprenticeship, our author continued five or six
					years working as a compositor and corrector of the press to a print-<lb/>
               <fw type="sig">g 3</fw>
               <pb n="iv"/>ing-office, and
					part of the time as an overseer; and, at length thus working his way upwards
					into daylight, he took up his freedom, and set up for himself; at first in a
					court in Fleet-street, from whence, as his business grew more extensive, he
					removed into Salisbury-court. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was not one of those
					who make genius an excuse for idleness. He had been diligent and conscientious
					as an apprentice, he was assiduous and liberal as a master. Besides the proper
					work of a printer, he did a good deal of business for the booksellers, in
					writing for them indexes, prefaces, and, as he styles them, honest dedications.
					These humble employments tended to facilitate to him the use and management of
					the pen. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref>'s
					punctuality, and the honour and generosity of his dealings, soon gained him
					friends, and his business greatly flourished. He printed for a while <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The True Briton</title>
               </hi>, a periodical
					paper, published in 1723, under the auspices of the <ref target="people.html#WhartonPhilip">Duke of Wharton</ref>, who, at that time,
					was endeavouring to foment a spirit of opposition in the city; and, to gain
					popularity, became a member of the wax-chandlers' company. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, though his
					principles were very different, was intimate with him, as was also, in early
					life, <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>. Some of the numbers
					of <hi rendition="#italics">The True Briton</hi> were prosecuted; but <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. R.</ref> escaped, as his name did
					not appear. He was engaged some time in printing a newspaper, called <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Daily Journal</title>
               </hi>, and afterwards,
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Daily Gazetteer</title>
               </hi>. Through
					the interest of the speaker, <ref target="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr.
						Onslow</ref>, he had the printing <pb n="v"/>of the <title>Journals of the
						House of Commons</title>, in twenty-six volumes, folio. <ref target="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr. Onslow</ref> had a great regard for
					him, and often received him at his house in Ember-court. Polite regards are
					sometimes more easily obtained than money from the court end of the town. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> did not find this
					branch of his business the one which yielded him the quickest returns. He thus
					writes to his friend <ref target="people.html#HillAaron">Aaron Hill</ref>:
					"As to my silence, I have been at one time exceedingly busy in getting
					ready some volumes of Journals, to entitle myself to a payment which yet I never
					had, no, not to the value of a shilling, though the debt is upwards of three
					thousand pounds, and though I have pressed for it, and been excessively pressed
					for the want of it.''</p>
            <p> He was chosen master of his company, an office which, in the stationers'
					company, is not only honourable but lucrative, in 1754; on which occasion one of
					his friends tells him, that though he did not doubt his going very well through
					every other part of the duty, he feared his habitual abstemiousness would allow
					him to make but a very poor figure at the city feasts. His indulgencies were not
					of the sensual kindâhe had, according to the salutary custom of the London
					citizens, a country residence; first at North-end, near Hammersmith, and
					afterwards at Parson's-green, where he spent the time he could spare from
					business, and seldom without visitors. He loved to encourage diligence and early
					rising amongst his journeymen, and often hid a half-crown amongst the letters,
					so that the first who came to work in a morning <pb n="vi"/>might find it. At
					other times he brought, for the same purpose, fruit from his garden. </p>
            <p> In addition to his other business, <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> purchased, in 1760, a moiety of the patent of law
					printer to his majesty, which department of his business he carried on in
					partnership with Miss <ref target="people.html#LintotCatherine">Catherine
						Lintot</ref>. From all these sources he was enabled to make that comfortable
					provision for a rising family, which patient industry, judiciously directed,
					will, generally, in this country, enable a man to procure. </p>
            <p> But the genius of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
					was not destined to be for ever employed in ushering into the world the
					productions of others. His first work was his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi>. It grew out of the following circumstance.
					The booksellers, for whom it has been mentioned that he had occasionally
					employed his pen, had desired him to give them a volume of familiar letters upon
					various supposed occasions. He began;âbut letter producing letter it grew
					into a story, and was given to the public under the title of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The History of Pamela</title>
               </hi>. It appeared
					first in two volumes; two more were added afterwards. The idea the author set
					out with of writing letters for people of rather the lower class, probably
					determined him to the station of his heroine and the simplicity of her language. </p>
            <p> The author's object in <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi>
					is twofold: to reclaim a libertine by the influence of virtuous affection, and
					to conduct virtue safe and triumphant through the severest trials, to an
					honourable reward. For this purpose <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>, a <pb n="vii"/>young girl, born of poor but pious and worthy
					parents, taken by a lady of fashion to wait upon her person, and brought up by
					her with great tenderness and attention to her improvement, is, after the
					lady's death, at which event the story opens, exposed to the solicitations
					of her youthful master, the only son of her benefactress. The story is carried
					on by letters, chiefly between <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> and her father and mother. Her youth and innocence render her,
					for some time, unsuspecting of the passion she has inspired; and, when she can
					no longer misunderstand the purposes of her master, she prepares to leave his
					house; but he detains her under various pretences, and attempts liberties with
					her person, which she resists with firmness, as well as his pecuniary offers;
					though not disinclined to his person, and though she has no resource, on the
					supposition of leaving him, but to return to hard country labour. Her behaviour
					is all the while full of humility and respect to her master in every instance
					consistent with the defence of her honour. Her master, who, though young, is a
					practised libertine, finding her protected by the watchful advice of her
					parents, and by the care of a virtuous house-keeper, who had belonged to his
					mother, determines to convey her to a place where she shall be entirely in his
					power. Under pretence, therefore, of sending her home to her parents, he has her
					conveyed to another of his seats, where she is absolutely confined, under the
					guardianship of an abandoned woman, whose office it has been to minister to his
					pleasures. The poor <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> forms
					many schemes to get away, and attempts, by means <pb n="viii"/>of a young
					clergyman, to engage some of the families of the neighbourhood in her favour,
					but without effect. She then endeavours to escape alone, and actually gets
					through a barred window into the garden, from whence she hopes to escape into
					the fields, though ignorant of any one who will receive her; but she falls, and
					bruises herself in attempting to get over the high brick wall. Her sufferings in
					this attempt are affectingly described. Finding all her schemes abortive, she is
					greatly tempted to free herself from the danger of dishonour, by throwing
					herself into the pond; but considerations of piety at length prevail, and she
					determines to trust to Providence. Her master, after many ineffectual attempts
					to vanquish her resistance, begins to relent, professes honourable love to her;
					and, after a severe struggle between his passion and his pride of birth and
					fortune, offers her his hand in marriage. <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> acknowledges her love for
					him, and accepts (almost upon her knees, it must be allowed,) his proposal.
					Difficulties remain to be got over with <ref target="people.html#DaversLady">Lady Davers</ref>, a proud and termagant woman of quality, sister to <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref>; but the sweetness and prudence of
						<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> overcome her dislike,
					and the whole concludes with the perfect happiness of the wedded pair. </p>
            <p> Such is the outline of this first work of our author, which was published in
					1740. It was received with a burst of applause from all ranks of people. The
					novelty of the plan, the strokes of nature and pathos with which the work
					abounds, the simplicity of the language, the sentiments of piety and virtue that
					are brought forward, took at once the taste of the public. <pb n="ix"/>Numberless were the compliments <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
						Richardson</ref> received upon it as soon as he was known to be the author.
					It was not only read by all who sought entertainment, but was considered as a
					work of such excellent <hi rendition="#italics">moral</hi> tendency that it
					attracted the notice of grave divines, and was even recommended from the pulpit.
					It is impossible to peruse without astonishment the high eulogiums that were
					given to the work in this particular view. <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Mr. Pope</ref> declared it would do more
					good than many volumes of sermons. <ref target="people.html#LucasRichard">Mr.
						Lucas</ref>, the esteemed author of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The
							Search after Happiness</title>
               </hi>, a much graver character than <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>, and not personally acquainted
					with the author, calls it "the best book ever published, and calculated to
					do most good." The compliments of the author's friends in their
					letters were quite extravagant. It was immediately translated into French and
					Dutch. </p>
            <p> The fame of this once favourite work is now somewhat tarnished by time, as well
					as eclipsed by the author's subsequent publications; but the enthusiasm
					with which it was received, shows incontrovertibly, that a <hi rendition="#italics">novel</hi> written on the side of virtue was considered
					as a new experiment. </p>
            <p> Appretiating it at this distance of time, we must acknowledge that the faults
					are great, but the beauties are genuine. The character of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>, so long as her sole object
					was to resist her master's attempts, is beautifully drawn, with many
					affecting incidents, and little strokes of nature. Her innocent prattle to <ref target="people.html#MrsJervis">Mrs. Jervis</ref>, the rustic dress in which
					she equips herself, <pb n="x"/>when determined to leave her place, her stealing
					down to the kitchen to try if she could scour the pewter, in order to accustom
					herself to coarse household workâ"I see I could do it," says
					she, "it only blistered my hand in two places;" the sudden spring she
					gives on seeing her father, by which she overturns the card-table, and the
					affecting account of her sufferings on attempting to make her escape, are all
					worthy of a masterhand. There are not many under-characters in this work; the
					most pleasing, and perhaps the best sustained, of the whole, are those of <ref target="people.html#AndrewsGoodman">Goodman Andrews</ref> and his wife, <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>'s father and mother. It
					would not be easy to find a prettier picture of low life, and of true English
					low life, in its most respectable garb; made respectable by strict honesty,
					humility, patience of labour, and domestic affection; the whole rendered saintly
					and venerable by a touching air of piety and resignation, which pervades all
					their sentiments. The behaviour of the old man, when he walks to <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref>'s to inquire after his child, and
					his humble grief, are truly pathetic. The language of the good couple is simple,
					without being vulgar. It is not the simplicity of Arcadian shepherds: it is such
					as people in low life, with the delicacy of a virtuous mind, might fall into
					without any other advantages than a Bible education. It is the simplicity of an
					English cottage. </p>
            <p> The character of <ref target="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</ref> himself is drawn
					with less address than that of any one in the piece; he is proud, stern,
					selfish, forbidding, (selfish, that is to say, in his love, for he has <pb n="xi"/>generosity enough in money matters,) and his ideas of the authority
					of a husband are so high, that it is not easy to conceive of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>'s being rewarded by
					marrying him, unless her regard for external circumstances was greater than the
					author would wish to have supposed. The moral of this piece is more dubious
					than, in his lifetime, the author's friends were willing to allow. So long
					as <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> is solely occupied in
					schemes to escape from her persecutor, her virtuous resistance obtains our
					unqualified approbation; but from the moment she begins to entertain hopes of
					marrying him, we admire her guarded prudence, rather than her purity of mind.
					She has an end in view, an interested end; and we can only consider her as the
					conscious possessor of a treasure, which she is wisely resolved not to part with
					but for its just price. In real life we should perhaps consider <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> at this period as an
					interested girl, and it is difficult to imagine how a young woman of so much
					purity of mind should feel her affections engaged to a man during a series of
					the grossest attempts upon her virtue, and who, moreover, used no gentle arts of
					seduction, but sought to awe her as a master and intimidate her with sternness,
					rather than to win upon her as a lover. </p>
            <p> Indeed, the excessive humility and gratitude expressed by herself and her
					parents on her exaltation, show a regard to rank and riches beyond the just
					measure of an independent mind. The pious <ref target="people.html#AndrewsGoodman">Goodman Andrews</ref> should not have
					thought his virtuous daughter so infinitely be-<lb/>

					licentious master, who, after all, married her to gratify his own passions. </p>
            <p> The indelicate scenes in this novel have been justly found fault with, and are,
					indeed, totally indefensible. <ref target="people.html#WattsIsaac">Dr.
						Watts</ref>, to whom he sent the volumes, instead of compliments, writes him
					word, that he understands the ladies complain they cannot read them without
					blushing. </p>
            <p> The third and fourth volumes are much inferior to the first two: they are indeed
					superfluous to the story, which is properly terminated with the marriage of <ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref>; but prolixity was the fault
					of this author. <ref target="people.html#agoldoni">Goldoni</ref> has written two
					plays on the subject of this novel; his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela
							Nubile</title>
               </hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela
							Maritata</title>
               </hi>. It is well known that <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>, who started in his career
					of fame soon after <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>,
					wrote his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Joseph Andrews</title>
               </hi> in
					ridicule of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi>. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was exceedingly hurt
					at this, the more so as they had been upon good terms, and he was very intimate
					with <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>'s two sisters.
					He never appears cordially to have forgiven it: perhaps it was hardly in human
					nature that he should; and he always speaks in his letters with great asperity
					of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Tom Jones</title>
               </hi>, more indeed than was
					quite graceful in a rival author. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> and <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>
					possessed very different excellencies.â<ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref> had all the ease which
						<ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> wanted, a
					genuine flow of humour, and a rich variety of comic character; nor was he
					wanting in strokes of an amiable sensibility: but he could not describe a
					consistently virtuous character, and in deep pathos he was far excelled by his
					rival. <pb n="xiii"/>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi>, captivating as the
					publication had proved to be, showed only the dawn of its author's genius,
					who, encouraged by the applauses and benefited by the criticisms which he had
					received, proceeded to plan a new work, the first two volumes of which were
					published eight years after the preceding. </p>
            <p> The production upon which the fame of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> is principally founded, that which will transmit his name
					to posterity as one of the first geniuses of the age in which he lived, is
					undoubtedly his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi>. Nothing
					can be more simple than the story:âA young lady, pressed by her parents to
					marry a man every way disagreeable to her, and placed under the most cruel
					restraint, leaves her father's house, and throws herself upon the
					protection of her lover, a man of sense and spirit, but a libertine. When he
					finds her in his power, he artfully declines marriage, and conveys her to a
					house kept for the worst of purposes. There, after many fruitless attempts to
					ensnare her virtue, he at length violates her person. She escapes from further
					outrage: he finds her out in her retreat; offers her marriage, which she
					rejects. Her friends are obdurate. She retires to solitary lodgings; grief and
					shame overwhelm her, and she dies broken-hearted. Her friends lament their
					severity when too late. Her violator is transiently stung with remorse, but not
					reformed; he leaves the kingdom in order to dissipate his chagrin, and is killed
					in a duel by a relation of the lady's. </p>
            <p> On this slight foundation, and on a story not very agreeable or promising in its
					rude outline, <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">h 2</fw>
               <pb n="xiv"/>has our author founded a most pathetic tale, and raised a noble
					temple to female virtue. The first volumes are somewhat tedious, from the
					prolixity incident to letter-writing, and require a persevering reader to get
					through them: but the circumstantial manner of writing which <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> practised, has the
					advantage of making the reader thoroughly acquainted with those in whose fate he
					is to be interested. In consequence of this, our feelings are not transient,
					elicited here and there by a pathetic stroke; but we regard his characters as
					real personages, whom we know and converse with, and whose fate remains to be
					decided in the course of events. The characters, much more numerous than in <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi>, are all distinctly drawn
					and well preserved, and there is a proper contrast and variety in the casting of
					the parts. The plot, as we have seen, is simple, and no under-plots interfere
					with the main design. No digressions, no episodes. It is wonderful that without
					these helps of common writers, he could support a work of such length. With <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> it begins,âwith
						<ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> it ends. We do not
					come upon unexpected adventures and wonderful recognitions, by quick turns and
					surprises: we see her fate from afar, as it were through a long avenue, the
					gradual approach to which, without ever losing sight of the object, has more of
					simplicity and grandeur than the most cunning labyrinth that can be contrived by
					art. In the approach to the modern country-seat, we are made to catch
					transiently a side-view of it through an opening of the trees, or to burst upon
					it from a <pb n="xv"/>sudden turning in the road; but the old mansion stood full
					in the eye of the traveller, as he drew near it, contemplating its turrets,
					which grew larger and more distinct every step that he advanced, and leisurely
					filling his eye and his imagination with still increasing ideas of its
					magnificence.âAs the work advances, the character rises; the distress is
					deepened; our hearts are torn with pity and indignation; bursts of grief succeed
					one another, till at length the mind is composed and harmonized with emotions of
					milder sorrow; we are calmed into resignation, elevated with pious hope, and
					dismissed glowing with the conscious triumphs of virtue. </p>
            <p> The first group which presents itself is that of the Harlowe family. They are
					sufficiently discriminated, yet preserve a family likeness. The stern father,
					the passionate and dark-souled brother, the envious and ill-natured sister, the
					money-loving uncles, the gentle but weakspirited mother, are all assimilated by
					that stiffness, love of parade, and solemnity, which is thrown over the whole,
					and by the interested family views in which they all concur. <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref> is a young lady of great
					generosity and ardent feelings, with a high spirit and some love of teasing,
					which she exercises on her mother, a managing and notable widow lady, and on her
					humble servant <ref target="people.html#MrHickman">Mr. Hickman</ref>, a man
					deserving of her esteem, but prim and formal in his manner. <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref> is a character of strong
					lights and shades, but her warmest affections are all along directed to her
					friend; and the correspond-<lb/>
               <fw type="sig">h 3</fw>
               <pb n="xvi"/>ence between them is made the great vehicle
					of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>'s narrative of
					events, as that between <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> and
					his friend <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> is of <hi rendition="#italics">his</hi> schemes and designs. The character of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> herself is very highly
					wrought: she has all the grace, and dignity, and delicacy, of a finished model
					of female excellence. Her duty to her parents is implicit, except in the article
					of sacrificing herself to a man utterly disgustful to her; and she bears with
					the greatest meekness the ill usage she receives from the other branches of the
					family. Duty, indeed, is the great principle of her conduct. Her affections are
					always completely under command; and her going off with <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> appears a step she was
					betrayed, not persuaded, into. His persuasions she had withstood; and it was
					fear, not love, that at last precipitated her into his protection. If,
					therefore, the author meant to represent her subsequent misfortunes as a
					punishment, he has scarcely made her faulty enough. That a young lady has eloped
					from her father's house with a libertine, sounds, indeed, like a grave
					offence; but the fault, when it is examined into, is softened and shaded off by
					such a variety of circumstances, that it becomes almost evanescent. Who that
					reads the treatment she experienced, does not wonder at her long-suffering?
					After <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> finds herself,
					against her will and intention, in the power of her lover, the story becomes,
					for a while, a game at chess, in which both parties exert great skill and
					presence of mind, and quick observation of each other's motions. Not a
					moment of weakness does <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>
					betray; and <pb n="xvii"/> she only loses the game because she plays fairly and
					with integrity, while he is guilty of the basest frauds. </p>
            <p> During this part of the story, the generality of readers are perhaps inclined to
					wish that <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> should give up his
					wicked intentions, reform, and make <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> happy in the marriage state. This was the conclusion which
						<ref target="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</ref> so
					vehemently and passionately urged the author to adopt. But when the unfeeling
					character of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> proceeds to
					deeper and darker wickedness; when his unrelenting cruelty meditates, and
					actually perpetrates, the last unmanly outrage upon unprotected innocence and
					virtue,âthe heart surely cannot have right feelings that does not
					cordially detest so black a villain, notwithstanding the agreeable qualities
					which are thrown into his character; and that woman must have little delicacy,
					who does not feel that his crime has raised an eternal wall of separation
					between him and the victim of his treachery, whatever affection she might have
					previously entertained for him. Yet it is said by some, that the author has made
						<ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> too agreeable, and his
					character has been much the object of criticism. But a little reflection will
					show us, that the author had a more difficult part to manage, in drawing his
					character, than that of any other in the work, and that he could not well have
					made him different from what he is. If he had drawn a mean-spirited dark
					villain, without any specious qualities, his <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> would have been
					degraded. <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, as he is to win the
					affections of the heroine, is neces-<pb n="xviii"/>sarily, in some sort, the
					hero of the piece, and no one in it must be permitted to outshine him. The
					author, therefore, gives him wit and spirit, and courage, and generosity, and
					manly genteel address, and also transient gleams of feeling, and transient
					stings of remorse; so that we are often led to hope he may follow his better
					angel, and give up his atrocious designs. This the author has done, and less he
					could not do, for the man whom <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> was inclined to favour. Besides, if it was part of his
					intention to warn young women against placing their affections upon libertines,
					it was certainly only against the agreeable ones of that class that he had any
					occasion to warn them. He tells us in one of his letters, that finding he had
					made him too much a favourite, he had thrown in some darker shades to obviate
					the objection; and surely the shades are dark enough. In one particular,
					however, the author might perhaps have improved the moral effect of the work; he
					might have given more of horror to the last scene of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>'s life. When <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> and he were finally
					separated, there was no occasion to keep measures with him; and why should <ref target="people.html#Belton">Belton</ref> die a death of so much horror, and
						<ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> of calm composure and
					self-possession? <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> dies in a
					duel, admirably well described, in which he behaves with the cool intrepidity of
					a gentleman and a man of spirit. <ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel
						Morden</ref> could not behave better. Some tender strokes are thrown in on
					his parting with <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref>, and on other
					occasions, tending to interest the reader in his favour; and his last words,
					"Let <pb n="xix"/> this expiate," and manifestly intended to do away
					our resentment, and leave a favourable impression on our minds with regard to
					his future prospects. Something, indeed, is mentioned of impatience, and a
					desire of life; but <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>
               <hi rendition="#italics"> could</hi> have drawn a scene
					which would have made us turn with horror from the features of the gay, the
					agreeable seducer, when changed into the agonizing countenance of the despairing
					self-accuser. </p>
            <p> But if the author might have improved in this respect the character of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, that of <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> comes up to all the
					ideas we can form of female loveliness and dignified suffering. The first scenes
					with her hard-hearted family show the severe struggles she had with herself,
					before she could withdraw her obedience from her parents. The measure of that
					obedience in <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>'s
					mind was very high; and therefore <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> seems all along, rather to lament the cruelty, than to
					resent the injustice, of imposing a husband upon her without her own consent. It
					is easy to see she would have thought it her duty to comply, if he had not been
					quite so disagreeable. The mother is a very mean character; she gives a tacit
					permission to <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> to
					correspond with <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> to prevent
					mischief, and yet consents to be the tool of the family in persecuting her
					innocent and generous daughter;âbut this was her duty to her
					husband!âYet, distressing as <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>'s situation is in her father's house, the author
					has had the address to make the reader feel, the moment she has got out of it,
					that he would give the world to have her safe back again. Nothing takes place of
						<pb n="xx"/> that pleasure and endearment which might naturally be expected
					on the meeting of two lovers: we feel that she has been hunted into the toils,
					and that every avenue is closed against her escape. No young person, on reading
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi>, even at this period
					of the story, can think of putting herself into the power of a lover, without
					annexing to it the strongest sense of degradation and anxiety. A great deal of
					contrivance is expended by the author, in the various plots set on foot by <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, to keep his victim tolerably
					easy in her ambiguous situation; and though some of these are tedious, it was
					necessary, for <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>'s
					honour, to make the reader sensible that she had an inextricable net wound
					around her, and that it was not owing to her want of prudence or vigilance that
					she did not escape. In the mean time the wit of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> and the sprightliness of <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref> prevent monotony. In one
					instance, however, <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref>
					certainly sins against the delicacy of her character, that is, in allowing
					herself to be made a show of to the loose companions of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>:âBut, how does her
					character rise, when we come to the more distressful scenes; the view of her
					horror, when, deluded by the pretended relations, she reenters the fatal house;
					her temporary insanity after the outrage, in which she so affectingly holds up
					to <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> the license he had
					procured; and her dignified behaviour when she first sees her ravisher, after
					the perpetration of his crime. What finer subject could be presented to the
					painter, than that in which <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> grasps the penknife in her hand, "her eyes lifted up to
					heaven, the whites of them only visible," <pb n="xxi"/>ready to plunge it
					in her breast, to preserve herself from further outrage; <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, aghast with terror, and
					speechless, thrown back to the further end of the room!âor the prison
					scene, where she is represented kneeling amidst the gloom and horror of the
					dismal abode; illuminating, as it were, the dark chamber; her face reclining on
					her crossed arms, her white garments floating round her in the negligence of
					woe; <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> contemplating her with
					respectful commiseration:âor the scene of calmer but heart-piercing
					sorrow, in the interview <ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel
						Morden</ref> has with her in her dying moments: She is represented
					"fallen into a slumber in her elbow-chair, leaning on the <ref target="people.html#WidowLovick">widow Lovick</ref>, whose left arm is
					around her neck; one faded cheek resting on the good woman's bosom, the
					kindly warmth of which had overspread it with a faintish flush, the other pale
					and hollow, as if already iced over by death; her hands, the blueness of the
					veins contrasting their whiteness, hanging lifelessly before her, the
					widow's tears dropping unfelt upon her faceâ<ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref>, with his arms
					folded, gazing on her in silence, her coffin just appearing behind a

					work, has been always allowed;âbut what is the moral?âIs it that a
					young lady who places her affections upon a libertine, will be deceived and
					ruined? Though the author no doubt intended this as one of the conclusions to be
					drawn, such a maxim has not dignity or force enough in it to be the chief moral
					of this interesting tale. And it has been already mentioned that <ref target="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</ref> can hardly stand as an
					example of such a choice, as she never fairly made the choice. On the contrary,
					she is always ready, both before her elopement and after it, to resign the
					moderate, the almost insensible predilection she feels for <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, to the will of her parents, if
					she might only be permitted to refuse the object of her aversion. Is she, then,
					exhibited as a rare pattern of chastity? Surely this is an idea very degrading
					to the sex. <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, indeed, who has a
					very bad opinion of women, and thinks that hardly any woman can resist him,
					talks of trying her virtue, and speaks as if he expected her to fail in the

						<ref target="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</ref> was tried, because the
					pecuniary offers were a temptation which many in her station of life would have

					her lover's powerâshe could have felt nothing but indignation at the
					first idea which entered her mind that he meant to degrade her into a mistress.
					Was it likely that she, who had shown that her affections were so much under her
					command while the object of his addresses appeared to be honourable marriage,
					should not guard against every freedom with the most cautious vigilance, as soon
					as she experienced a behaviour in him which must at once destroy her esteem for
					him, and be offensive to her just pride, as well as to her modesty? It is absurd
					therefore in <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> to speak of
					trying her chastity; and the author is not free from blame in favouring the idea
					that such resistance had any thing in it uncommon, or peculiarly meritorious.

					separating herself from her lover as soon as she perceives his dishonourable

					rejection of those overtures of marriage, which a common mind might have

					own ideas of the efficacy of a parent's curse on this occasion. The too
					high colouring of some of the scenes has been objected to, as tending to inflame
					passions which it was the author's professed aim to regulate. He was led to
					it, in some measure, by the nature of his story; but he seems to have begun
					writing with a coarseness of ideas in this respect, which he got rid of by

            <p> The character of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, though
					laboured with great art, is perhaps, after all, more of a fancy piece than a
					real portrait of an English libertine. Where is the libertine who would attempt
					in England the seduction of a young woman, guarded by birth and respectable
					situations in life, and friends jealous of their honour, and an education which
					would set them far out of the reach of any disgraceful overtures? A love of
					intrigue, rather than a love of pleasure, characterizes <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>; he is a cool systematic
					seducer, and the glory of conquest is what he principally aims at. Had such a
					character been placed in France, and his gallantries directed to married women,
					it would have been more natural, and his epistolary memoirs rendered more
					probable; <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">i 3</fw>
               <pb n="xxviii"/> but in England <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> would have been run through the body, long before he had

						<ref target="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel Morden</ref>.</p>
            <p> There is an improbability which the author could not well avoid, as it resulted
					from his plan of carrying on the narrative by letters; and that is, the tame
					acquiescence of <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> in a villainy
					which he all along so strongly disapproves. It is true, as a man of honour, he
					might think himself obliged not to betray his friend's secrets; but his
					disapprobation would certainly have prevented his friend from communicating
					those secrets. <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> is, in fact,
					reformed, from the time we first hear of him; and therefore those intimate
					communications could not any longer have subsisted. But <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref> is a being created in order to
					carry on the story, and must not be made too strictly the object of criticism. A
					novel-writer must violate probability somewhere, and a reader ought to make all
					handsome and generous allowances for it. We should open a book as we enter into
					a company, well persuaded that we must not expect perfection. In <ref target="people.html#Belford">Belford</ref>, too, we have a reformed
					libertine, one whom the reader regards with esteem and affection. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> mentions in one of
					his letters, that <ref target="people.html#MooreEdward">Mr. Moore</ref>, author
					of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>The Foundling</title>

					great pleasure be the <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> of it.
					The powers of <ref target="people.html#MooreEdward">Moore</ref> were by no means
					equal to such an undertaking; but if they had been greater, the gaiety and
					spirit of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>, in the hands of

						<ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>, in his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Life of Rowe</title>
               </hi>, expresses himself in
					the following forcible language: </p>
            <p> "The character of <ref target="people.html#Lothario">Lothario</ref> seems
					to have been expanded by <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> into that of <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>; but he has excelled his original in the moral effect of the
					fiction. <ref target="people.html#Lothario">Lothario</ref>, with gaiety which
					cannot be hated, and bravery which cannot be despised, retains too much of the
					spectator's kindness. It was in the power of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> alone, to teach us at
					once esteem and detestation; to make virtuous resentment overpower all the
					benevolence which wit, and elegance, and courage, naturally excite; and to lose
					at last the hero in the villain." </p>
            <p> The interest which <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi> excited
					at the time, was increased by the suspense in which its readers were so long
					held. In general, the suspense of a reader lasts no longer than the time which
					is necessary for him to read the book; and, in the case <pb n="xxx"/>of a book
					which is much talked of, very few readers enjoy the full pleasure of the story,
					as they can scarcely help learning, from some quarter or other, how it is to
					end. But in this instance, the interval of several months, which was allowed to
					pass between the publication of the first four volumes and the remaining four,
					wound up its readers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm; and the pleadings of
					the author's correspondents for a happy end were as warm and earnest as if
					they had related to the fate of a real character. To have made a different
					ending the author well knew would have spoiled his work, yet he could not but
					have been secretly flattered with seeing the strong impression he had made. </p>
            <p> The <ref target="people.html#Prevostabbe">AbbÃ© Prevost</ref> gave a version
					of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi> into French, but rather
					an abridgement than a translation. It was afterwards rendered more faithfully by
						<ref target="people.html#LeTourneurP">Le Tourneur</ref>. <ref target="people.html#Prevostabbe">Prevost</ref> says, and truly, that <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi> required some softening to
					adapt it to the more delicate taste of the French. It was also translated into
					Dutch by <ref target="people.html#StinstraJohannes">Mr. Stinstra</ref>, and into
					German under the auspices of the celebrated <ref target="people.html#HallerAlbrechtvon">Dr. Haller</ref>. </p>
            <p> Our author was now at the zenith of his fame; but his fancy was not exhausted,
					nor his powers of writing diminished; and after an interval of between four and
					five years he again appeared before the public. </p>
            <p> After <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</ref> had
					published two works, in each of which the principal character is a female, he
					determined to give the world an example of <hi rendition="#italics">a perfect
						man</hi>. His laudable design was to unite everything that is graceful and
					engaging <pb n="xxxi"/>in the man of spirit and the fine gentleman, with every
					moral virtue, and with the observance of the strict rules of
					Christianityâan arduous undertaking! He was partly stimulated to this
					design by the attacks of his female disciples, who, in answer to the reproaches
					he made them of liking <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref> too
					well, observed to him, that he had given them nobody else to like:âthe
					virtuous <ref target="people.html#MrHickman">Hickman</ref> was too tame and too
					formal to do justice to his good principles; and, in short, that he had not
					presented them with one male character on which the imagination might rest with
					complacence. If he did not wish they should regard men of pleasure with too
					favourable an eye, it was his duty to provide some one whom they might like upon
					principle. Upon this idea he determined to give them <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>A Good Man</title>
               </hi>, the title by which he always speaks of
					the work while he is writing it, though he afterwards changed it to that of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Sir Charles Grandison</title>
               </hi>. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> is a man of birth
					and fortune, endowed with every personal advantage, and master of every
					fashionable accomplishment. He is placed its a variety of situations, calculated
					to draw forth the virtues and energies of his character, as a son, a brother, a
					guardian, a friend, and a lover; and his conduct is everywhere exemplary. He is
					a man of address, of knowledge of the world, and makes himself to be respected
					in different countries, and by all sorts of people, bad as well as good. He is
					generous without profusion; religious without superstition; complaisant without
					weakness; firm in his purposes; rapid in the execution of them; jealous of his
						<pb n="xxxii"/>honour, yet always open to a generous reconciliation; feeling
					(at least as the author would have us believe) the passions of human nature, yet
					always possessing a perfect command over them. </p>
            <p> The conduct of this piece differs from that of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Pamela</title>
               </hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi> in this respect; that it does not depend
					upon one great event, but is intended to open and display this character in a
					variety of lights. The unity of the work, therefore, consists in the reference
					which every person, and every incident, bears to him who is the hero of it. Of
					him the author never loses sight after his first appearance, which he makes as
					soon as the reader has been prepared by the play of some inferior characters,
					(who, to use a military phrase, <hi rendition="#italics">keep the ground</hi>
					for him,) in a brilliant action, the rescuing the lady he is finally to marry,
					from the hands of a lawless ravisher. </p>
            <p> It was necessary for the execution of the plan, and it is so contrived in fact,
					that this work should be diversified with a greater variety of characters than
					his former ones. It has, particularly, many more of the pleasing cast. The
					author shows in it, that he had improved in the knowledge of life and the
					genteel world; and there are none of those warm descriptions in it which were
					justly blamed in its two elder sisters. He has an <hi rendition="#italics">enlÃ©vement</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note>Abduction.
						</note>
               </hi> an incident he seems to have been fond of, since it occurs in
					all the three works; but the object is only marriage, and it is managed with
					perfect decorum, at the same time that it presents a truly affecting scene. The
					early part of the novel presents a rich display of incidents and personages. The
					history of Sir Thomas and Lady Grandison is admirably executed, <pb n="xxxiii"/>and highly moral. The behaviour of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> to his
					father's mistress, to his sisters, to his uncle Lord W., to the <ref target="people.html#Danbys">Danbys</ref>, is all excellent, and opens his
					character to the greatest advantage.âBut the chief intrigue of the piece
					arises from the double love of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> to <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> and
						<ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>. A double love, say
					the critics in that passion, is no love at all; and they will insist upon it,
					that <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> is all
					along actuated by compassion solely for both the ladies. </p>
            <p> The character of <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> is
					meant by the author as a model of true female excellence; but it is judiciously
					kept down, not only with relation to <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, but to the
					high-wrought portrait of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">the Italian
						lady</ref>. <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> is
					gentle, timid, and somewhat passive; her character has no very prominent
					feature, except her love for <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref>. As she was destined to reward the hero, the author has shown
					great address in previously interesting his readers in her favour, before we
					become acquainted with <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>; so
					that notwithstanding our admiration for the latter, and the strong feelings she
					has called out, we all along consider the Italian family as intruders, and are
					glad, upon the whole, when <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is disengaged from them. We adore <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, but we come <hi rendition="#italics">home</hi> to <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had been accused of
					giving a coldness to his female characters in the article of love. The
					accusation was ill-founded; for the circumstances of the story in his two former
					pieces forbade the display of a very tender sensibility: but he has made ample
					amends for the imputed omission in his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Grandison</title>
               </hi>, where he has entered into the passion
					with all the minute-<pb n="xxxiv"/>ness, and delicacy, and warmth, that could be
					desired, and shown the female heart to be open to him in all its folds and
					recesses. In his Olivia, his <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Harriet</ref>, his <ref target="people.html#EmilyJervois">Emily</ref>, his
						<ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, he has well

            <p>But as the character of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is the most instructive, that of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> is the highest effort of
					genius in this piece. In her, he has drawn a young creature involved in a
					passion expressed with the utmost innocence and delicacy, yet so strong as to
					overturn her reason; and afterwards, on the recovery of her reason, after a
					severe struggle, voluntarily sacrificing that very passion at the shrine of
					religious principle. <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> is
					indeed a heroine, and her conduct is truly noble, because, with her articles of
					faith, the obstacle was, in reality, insurmountable to a well principled mind.
					Her faith might be erroneous; but her conduct, grounded on that faith, was just
					and rational. This sentiment is insisted on, because some good protestants have
					called <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> a poor
					narrow-minded bigot. A bigot she certainly was; but it had been strange if she
					had not believed the religion in which she had been carefully educated, and she
					only acted consistently with that belief. It were superfluous to any one who has
					perused this work, to remark the masterly manner in which the madness of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref> is painted. <ref target="people.html#WartonJoseph">Dr. Warton</ref> speaks thus of it: <pb n="xxxv"/>"I know not whether even the madness of Lear is wrought up
					and expressed by so many little strokes of nature and passion. It is absolute
					pedantry to prefer and compare the madness of Orestes, in <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#Euripides">Euripides</ref>
               </hi>, to this of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>." There is such a tenderness and innocence in her
					wanderings, such affecting starts of passion, such a significant woe in her
					looks and attitudes, such a sanctity of mind, with so much feeling, that he who
					is not moved with it must resign the pretension of being accessible to
					fictitious sorrow."<hi rendition="#sup">

					if he represented the contrary in his works. </p>
            <p> But though, in real life, a passion, however strong, will generally give way to
					time, at least so far as to permit the disappointed party to fill her proper
					station in social life, and fulfil the relative duties of it with calm
					complacence, if not with delight, we cannot easily figure to ourselves that <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, with such a high-toned
					mind, and a passion so exalted, a passion that had shaken the very seat of
					reason in her soul, could, or with so shattered an intellect ought to turn her
					thoughts to a second lover. Novels will always be different from real life, and
					therefore always, perhaps, in some degree, dangerous to the young mind: but they
					must be consistent with themselves; and if the author chose to describe a
					passion which unhinged the reason of one lady, and was sinking the other to the
					grave, a catastrophe which we are led to suppose would have been the effect of
						<ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>'s final
					disappointment, he should not then have been scrupulous of allowing it to have
					its full effect. </p>
            <p> The correspondence in these volumes is carried on, for the most part, between
						<ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref> and her friends and
						<ref target="people.html#LadyG">Lady G.</ref> (<ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>'s sister) on
					the one side, and <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> and Dr. Bartlett (a respectable clergyman) on the other. <ref target="people.html#LadyG">Lady G.</ref>'s character is sprightly and
					petulant, and her letters have a good deal of wit, though sometimes it
					degenerates into flippancy. She resembles <ref target="people.html#MissAnnaHowe">Miss Howe</ref>, but with less of fire and ardour, and more of levity. She
					behaves to her husband still more provokingly than that lady to <ref target="people.html#MrHickman">Mr.</ref>

               <ref target="people.html#MrHickman">Hickman</ref>.
					Notwithstanding, however, the general resemblance just suggested, and a few
					others that might be pointed out, there is no man, perhaps, who has written so
					much, and who has less repeated himself, than <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>. If we may judge by
					the variety of characters in this, his last publication, the fertility of his
					fancy was by no means exhausted. Of all the under characters, none is more
					delightful than <ref target="people.html#EmilyJervois">Emily Jervois</ref>, the
					young ward of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>,
					in the beautiful and touching simplicity with which he has invested her. Her
					unconscious love for her guardian, arising so naturally, as she advances towards
					womanhood, from her grateful affection and unbounded esteem for him; her
					ingenuous shame at the bad conduct of her dissolute mother, and her generosity
					to that mother on the first symptoms of reformation; together with the <hi rendition="#italics">naÃ¯vetÃ© </hi>which is so happily hit off both
					in her ideas and her language, render her uncommonly interesting. Mrs. Shirley
					is a graceful portrait of mild and venerable age. Lady Beauchamp's
					character gives <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>
					an opportunity to show the address and dexterous management of a man of the
					world; Olivia, his virtuous forbearance; the proud Porretta family, his manly
					spirit, tempered with presence of mind and a guarded prudence; the behaviour of
					Mr. Lowther, and the French surgeons, show a knowledge of professional
					character; and various parts of the work attest the author's improvement in
					general information, and more enlarged views of life.</p>
            <p>There is not, in any of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>'s works, one of those detached episodes, thrown in

                  <title>Sir Charles Grandison</title>
               </hi>, however, lies
					open,âas what work does not?âto criticism. Besides the double love
					which has been mentioned, there was another point which perplexed the author
					much: <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, as a
					Christian, was not to fight a duel; yet he was to be recognised as the finished
					gentleman, and could not be allowed to want that most essential part of the
					character, the deportment of a man of honour, courage, and spirit. And in order
					to exhibit his spirit and courage, it was necessary to bring them into action by
					adventures and rencounters. His first appearance is in the rescue of <ref target="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</ref>; a meritorious action,
					but one which must necessarily expose him to a challenge. How must the author
					untie this knot? He makes him so very good a swordsman, that he is always
					capable of disarming his adversary without endangering either of their lives.
					But are a man's principles to depend on the science of his fencing-master?
					Every one cannot have the skill of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>; every one cannot be the <hi rendition="#italics">best</hi> swordsman; and the man whose study it is to avoid fighting, is
						<pb n="xxxix"/>not quite so likely as another to be the best.â<ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</ref>, indeed, complimented the
					author upon his success in this nice point, in a flourishing epigram, which is
					thus expressed:<quote>
                  <lg type="stanza">
                     <l>What hast thou done? I'm ravish'd at the scene; </l>
                     <l>A sword undrawn makes mighty CÃ¦sars mean.<hi rendition="#sup">

									</note>
                        </hi>
                     </l>
                  </lg>
               </quote> But, in fact, it was not undrawn. In the affair with Sir
					Hargrave, he may be said to have really fought a duel; for, though he refuses
					the challenge in words, he virtually accepts it, by going into the garden with
					him, knowing his purpose. In like manner he with Greville retires to a private
					spot, and there, on his adversary's drawing, which he might be sure he
					would do, draws, disarms, and gives him his life. But Greville might not have
					given him his, nor could every one turn a duel into such harmless play. Can,
					then, a better expedient be suggested? If not, must we not fairly confess that,
					in certain cases, the code of the gospel and the code of worldly honour are
					irreconcileable, and that a man has only to make his choice which he will give
					up?</p>
            <p> Another fault is, a certain stiffness which, it can hardly be denied, is spread
					over this admirable character. This results partly from the author's style,
					which, where it aims to be elegant, wants ease; partly from the manner in which
					the hero is <hi rendition="#italics">pronÃ©</hi>, as the French say, by all
					the other characters, and from the abundance of compliments which are paid on
					all sides; for certainly <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir
						Charles</ref> is <hi rendition="#italics">de la vieille cour</hi>.<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note>"of the old court"; a
							gentleman in the old-fashioned, courtly style. In context, the adjective
							pronÃ© (above), appears to indicate that the hero is held in high
							esteem by others, the model of what is best; he is revered as the
							ultimate reference.</note>
               </hi> In part, too, it arises from the very
					circumstance of his being so perfect and so successful. Perfection of character,
					joined to distress, will interest; but <lb/>
               <fw type="sig">k 3</fw>
               <pb n="xl"/>prosperous perfection does not greatly
					engage our sympathy. We are apt to conceive of <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref> as having, in
					reality, no passions; and we do not greatly pity him for the loss of <ref target="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</ref>, when a most amiable lady,
					who had the other half of his heart, was waiting his acceptance on the other
					side of the water. We are not quite satisfied with the dutiful resignation with
					which he gives up corresponding with two amiable and beloved sisters, in
					compliance with the injunctions of a tyrannical father. We are the less
					surprised, however, as we recognise in it the high notions entertained by the
					author of parental authority; but we can give no answer to the question, How
					came so dutiful a son to enter into a treaty of marriage without consulting his
					father? except, what perhaps is sufficient, that it would have embarrassed the
					story. </p>
            <p> There is one important particular in which this highly-wrought character does
					not present an example for imitation, and that is his going so far into a
					matrimonial treaty with a bigoted catholic; with a woman whose very love for him
					must expose him to continual distressing importunities to change his religion.
					Italian servants, an Italian confessor, a stipulated residence half the year out
					of his native country, and, above all, the giving up half his children (it might
					happen to be all) to the errors of a faith which he believed to be
					erroneousâthese are among the sacrifices which a conscientious man will
					scruple, and a wise man will refuse, to make. Horrible must be a union, where
					the most tender affection can only serve to lacerate the heart, as must be <pb n="xli"/>the case when the object of it is supposed to be under the wrath of
					God, and doomed to everlasting perdition. This must be the consequence of
					marrying a bigot to any mode of faith, where the other party is of a different
					one. Add to this, that the very proposal, made so often by the proud Porretta
					family to <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</ref>, to
					change his religion for a wife, and bind himself to live half the year out of
					his native country, was a high insult to him, considered only as an English
					gentleman. The author, however, valued himself upon his management of this nice
					negotiation; and, in a letter to one of his French translators, dexterously
					brings it forward, as a proof of his candour and liberality towards the catholic
						religion<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note>It is said, that an Italian

            <p> The author of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Sir Charles</title>
               </hi> often
					mentions in his letters, that he was importuned by many of his friends to give
					them another volume; and the Gottenburg translators sent for the rest of the
					work, supposing it incomplete: he ought to have received it as a proof that it
					was too long, and not too short. He had already continued it a whole volume
					beyond the proper terminationâthe marriage of his hero; and having done
					so, he might, without more impropriety, have gone on to the next point of view,
					and the next, till he had given the history of two or three generations. <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Clarissa</title>
               </hi>, perhaps, runs out into
					too great a length, but bold were the hand that should attempt to shorten it.
						<hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Sir Charles</title>
               </hi>, on the con-<pb n="xlii"/>trary, would be improved by merely striking out the last volume,
					and, indeed, a good part of the sixth, where descriptions of dress, and parade,
					and furniture, after the interest is completely over, like the gaudy colouring
					of a western sky, give symptoms of a setting sun. But it is ungrateful to dwell
					on the faults of genius. </p>
            <p> The style of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, which
					it remains to take notice of, was not in proportion to his other excellencies of
					composition. He wrote with facility; expressions, as well as thoughts, flowing
					readily to his pen; but we do not find in his writings, either the ease and
					elegance of good company, or the polished period of a finished author. They are
					not only overloaded with a redundance of complimentary expression, which gives a
					stiffness to the dialogue, particularly in his <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Grandison</title>
               </hi>, where he has most attempted to give a
					picture of genteel life, but they are blemished with little flippancies of
					expression, new-coined words, and sentences involved and ill-constructed. If
					this was considered to be the case when <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> wrote, it is a still
					greater impediment to his fame at present, when we are become more fastidious
					with regard to style, in proportion as good writing is become more common; that
					degree, I mean, of good writing, which a habit of the pen will always give. The
					style of <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref>, however,
					has the property of setting before the reader, in the most lively manner, every
					circumstance of what he means to describe. He has the accuracy and finish of a
					Dutch painter, with the fine ideas of an Italian one. He is content to produce
					effects by the patient labour of minuteness. Had he turned <pb n="xliii"/>his
					thoughts to an observation of rural nature, instead of human manners, he would
					have been as accurate a describer as Cowper. How circumstantial is the following
					description of a bird new caught! "Hast thou not observed how, at first,
					refusing all sustenance, it beats and bruises itself against its wires, till it
					makes its gay plumage fly about, and overspread its well-secured cage? Now it
					gets out its head, sticking only at its beautiful shoulders; then, with
					difficulty, drawing back its head, it gasps for breath, and erectly perched,
					with meditating eyes, first surveys, and then attempts, its wired canopy. As it
					gets breath, with renewed rage, it beats and bruises again its pretty head and
					sides, bites the wires, and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer; till,
					at last, finding its efforts ineffectual, quite tired and breathless, it lays
					itself down, and pants at the bottom of the cage, seeming to bemoan its cruel
					fate and forfeited liberty.âAnd after a few days, its struggles to escape
					still diminishing, as it finds it to no purpose to attempt it, its new
					habitation becomes familiar, and it hops about from perch to perch, and every
					day sings a song to amuse itself, and reward its keeper."<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> It describes the progress of a virtuous courtship, and is said
					to have been the only one which experienced a great demand while publishing in
					numbers. He assisted in a few works for booksellers. </p>
            <p> The latter part of his life was spent in the enjoyment of his well-earned fame,
					and of a fortune gained by his own industry.âHe built an extensive range
					of warehouses for his business in Salisbury-court, and he had a country house
					first at North-End, and afterwards at Parson's Green. His manner of living
					was hospitable, but he was chiefly fond of female society, and was generally
					surrounded by a coterie of young ladies, many of whom, as <ref target="people.html#ChaponeMrs">Miss Mulso</ref> afterwards <ref target="people.html#ChaponeMrs">Mrs. Chapone</ref>, <ref target="people.html#DuncombeSusanna">Miss Highmore</ref> afterwards <ref target="people.html#DuncombeSusanna">Mrs. Duncombe</ref>, and <ref target="people.html#TalbotCatherine">Miss Talbot</ref>, were themselves
					distinguished in polite literature. In this mental seraglio, as it may be
					called, he had great facilities for that knowledge of the female heart which he
					has so eminently shown in his works; but it cannot be denied that it had a
					tendency to feed that self-importance which was perhaps his reigning foible.
					Experiencing no contradiction, and seeing no equal, he was constantly fed with
					adulation <pb n="xlv"/>and even his correspondencies with his male friends, such
					of them at least as have been preserved, (and he was remarkably fond of
					epistolary correspondence,) turn almost entirely upon his own works, and are
					full of such exaggerated compliments as must have appeared extraordinary, even
					when compliments were more in fashion than they are at present. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> was twice married;
					first to <ref target="people.html#WildeJohn">his master</ref>'s <ref target="people.html#RichardsonMarthawife">daughter</ref>, and afterwards to
					the <ref target="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">sister</ref> of <ref target="people.html#LeakeJames">Mr. Leake</ref>, a bookseller at Bath. By
					both he had a numerous offspring; but four daughters only, by the last, survived
					him. <ref target="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</ref> had high
					notions of parental authority, as he has shown in his works; and though, as a
					good and moral man under the influence of real principle, he fulfilled every
					essential relative duty, there was a certain formality and stiffness in the
					family intercourse, more favourable to reverence than to affection. His natural
					reservedness of manner he himself was sensible of, and lamented. It was probably
					increased by the nervous disorders, from which he was a great sufferer, and
					which were brought on by no intemperance, as he observes, but that of study. It
					is indeed astonishing how a man, who had to raise his fortune by the slow
					process of his own industry, to take care of an extensive business, and who had
					a number of connections and relatives, to all of whom he was very kind, could
					find time, in the breaks and pauses of his other avocations, to write nineteen
					close-printed volumes, as he often mentions when his correspondents were urging
					him to enter upon another work. Where there exists strong genius the bent of the
					mind is imperious, and will be obey-<pb n="xlvi"/>ed, but the body too often
					sinks under it. <ref target="people.html#ChaponeMrs">Mrs. Chapone</ref>, in her
