            <p> It is necessary to speak of living authors with that temperance of praise which
                    may not offend their delicacy; and though this lady by marriage with a
                    foreigner, and her residence abroad, is in a manner lost to this her native
                    country, the writer of these remarks does not feel herself at liberty to search
                    for anecdotes which might gratify curiosity, or endeavour to detail the events
                    of a life which every admirer of genius will wish prolonged to many succeeding
                    years. One anecdote, however, may be mentioned, which is current, and she
                    believes has never been contradicted. <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss

               <pb n="ii"/>when she was in
                    the early bloom of youth, about seventeen. She wrote it without the knowledge of
                    any of her friends. With the modesty of a young woman, and the diffidence of a
                    young author, she contrived to throw it into the press anonymously, and, when
                    published, laid the volumes in the way of her friends, whose impartial plaudits
                    soon encouraged her to confess to whom they were obliged for their
                    entertainment. There is perhaps no purer or higher pleasure than the young mind
                    enjoys in the first burst of praise and admiration which attends a successful
                    performance. To be lifted up at once into the favourite of the public; to be
                    sensible that the name, hitherto pronounced only in the circle of family
                    connexions, is become familiar to all that read, through every province of a
                    large kingdom; to feel in the glow of genius and freshness of invention powers
                    to continue that admiration to future years;—to feel all this, and at the
                    same time to be happily ignorant of all the chills and mortifications, the
                    impossibility not to flag in a long work, the ridicule and censure which fasten
                    on vulnerable parts, and the apathy or diffidence which generally seizes an
                    author before his literary race is run;—this is happiness for youth, and
                    youth alone. </p>

               <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Evelina</hi>
               </title> became at once a fashionable
                    novel: there are even those who still prefer it to <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Cecilia</hi>
               </title>, though that preference is
                    probably owing to the partiality inspired by a first performance. Evelina is a
                    young lady, amiable and inexperienced, who is continually getting into
                    difficulties from not knowing or not observing the established <pb n="iii"/>etiquettes of society, and from being unluckily connected with a number of
                    vulgar characters, by whom she is involved in a series of adventures both
                    ludicrous and mortifying. Some of these are certainly carried to a very
                    extravagant excess, particularly the tricks played upon the poor Frenchwoman;
                    but the fondness for humour, and low humour, which <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</ref> discovered in this piece,
                    runs through all her subsequent works, and strongly characterizes, sometimes
                    perhaps blemishes, her genius. Lord Orville is a generous and pleasing lover;
                    and the conclusion is so wrought, as to leave upon the mind that glow of
                    happiness which is not found in her subsequent works. The meeting between
                    Evelina and her father is pathetic. The agonizing remorse and perturbation of
                    the man who is about to see, for the first time, his child whom he had deserted,
                    and whose mother had fallen a sacrifice to his unkindness; the struggles between
                    the affection which impels him towards her, and the dread he feels of seeing in
                    her the image of his injured wife; are described with many touches of nature and
                    strong effect.—Other characters in the piece are, Mrs. Selwyn, a wit and
                    an oddity; a gay insolent baronet; a group of vulgar cits; a number of young
                    bucks, whose coldness, carelessness, rudeness, and impertinent gallantry, serve
                    as a foil to the delicate attentions of Lord Orville. </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Evelina</hi>
               </title> greatly
                    pleased; and the interest the public took in the young writer was rewarded with
                    fresh pleasure by the publication of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Cecilia</hi>
               </title>, than which it would be difficult <milestone unit="signature" n="a 2" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="iv"/>to find a novel with more various and
                    striking beauties. Among these may be reckoned the style, which is so varied,
                    according to the characters introduced, that, without any information from the
                    names, the reader would readily distinguish the witty loquacity of Lady Honoria
                    Pemberton, the unmeaning volubility of Miss Larolles, the jargon of the captain,
                    the affected indifference of Meadows, the stiff pomposity of Delville senior,
                    the flighty heroics of Albany, the innocent simplicity of Miss Belfield, the
                    coarse vulgarity of her mother, the familiar address and low comic of Briggs,
                    and the cool finesse of the artful attorney, with many others,—all
                    expressed in language appropriate to the character, and all pointedly
                    distinguished from the elegant and dignified style of the author herself. The
                    character of the miser Briggs is pushed, perhaps, to a degree of extravagance,
                    though certainly not more so than <ref target="people.html#Moliere">Moliere</ref>'s Harpagon; but it is highly comic, and it is not the
                    common idea of a miser half-starved, sullen and morose; an originality is given
                    to it by making him jocose, good-humoured, and not averse to enjoyment when he
                    can have it for nothing. All the characters are well discriminated, from the
                    skipping Morrice, to the artful Monckton, and the high-toned feeling of Mrs.
                    Delville. The least natural character is Albany. An idea prevailed at the time,
                    but probably without the least foundation, that <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref> had supplied the
                    part.</p>
            <p> Cecilia herself is an amiable and dignified character. She is brought into
                    situations di-<pb n="v"/>stressful and humiliating, by the peculiarity of her
                    circumstances, and a flexibility and easiness readily pardoned in a young
                    female. The restriction she is laid under of not marrying any one who will not
                    submit to assume her name is a new circumstance, and forms, very happily, the
                    plot of the piece. Love appears with dignity in Cecilia; with fervour, but
                    strongly combated by pride as well as duty, in young Delville; with all the
                    helplessness of unrestrained affection in Miss Belfield, whose character of
                    simplicity and tenderness much resembles that of Emily in <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Sir Charles Grandison</hi>
               </title>.<hi rendition="#sup">

                            Richardson</ref>.</note>
               </hi> If resemblances are sought for, it may
                    also be observed that the situation of Cecilia with Mrs. Delville is similar to
                    that of <ref target="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</ref>'s Marianne with
                    the mother of Valville. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</ref> possess equal powers of
                    pathos and of humour. The terrifying voice of the unknown person who forbids the
                    banns has an electrifying effect upon the reader; and the distress of Cecilia
                    seeking her husband about the streets, in agony for his life, till her reason
                    suddenly fails, is almost too much to bear. Indeed we lay down the volumes with
                    rather a melancholy impression upon our minds; there has been so much of
                    distress that the heart feels exhausted, and there are so many deductions from
                    the happiness of the lovers, that the reader is scarcely able to say whether the
                    story ends happily or unhappily. It is true that in human life things are
                    generally so balanced; but in fictitious writings it is more agreeable, if they
                    are not <milestone unit="signature" n="a 3" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="vi"/>meant to end tragically, to leave on the mind the rainbow colours of
                    delight in their full glow and beauty.</p>
            <p> But the finest part of these volumes is the very moral and instructive story of
                    the <hi rendition="#italics">Harrels</hi>. It is the high praise of <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</ref>, that she has not
                    contented herself with fostering the delicacies of sentiment, and painting in
                    vivid colours those passions which nature has made sufficiently strong. She has
                    shown the value of economy, the hard-heartedness of gaiety, the mean rapacity of
                    the fashionable spendthrift. She has exhibited a couple, not naturally bad, with
                    no other inlet to vice, that appears on the face of the story, than the
                    inordinate desire of show and splendour, withholding his hard-earned pittance
                    from the poor labourer, and lavishing it on every expensive trifle. She has
                    shown the wife trifling and helpless, vain, incapable of serious thought or
                    strong feeling; and has beautifully delineated the gradual extinction of an
                    early friendship between two young women whom youth and cheerfulness alone had
                    assimilated, as the two characters diverged in afterlife,—a circumstance
                    that frequently happens. She has shown the husband fleecing his guest and his
                    ward by working on the virtuous feelings of a young mind, and has conducted him
                    by natural steps to the awful catastrophe. The last scene at Vauxhall is
                    uncommonly animated; every thing seems to pass before the reader's eyes.
                    The forced gaiety, the starts of remorse, the despair, the bustle and glare of
                    the place, the situation <pb n="vii"/>of the unprotected females in such scene
                    of horror, are all most forcibly described. We almost hear and feel the report
                    of the pistol.—In the uncommon variety of characters which this novel
                    affords, there are many other deserving of notice; that, for instance, of the
                    high-minded romantic Belfield may give a salutary lesson to many a youth who
                    fancies his part in life <hi rendition="#italics">ill cast,</hi> who wastes life
                    in projects, and does nothing because he thinks every thing beneath his ambition
                    and his talents.</p>
            <p> Such are the various merits of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Cecilia</hi>
               </title>, through the whole of which it is evident that the
                    author draws from life, and exhibits not only the passions of human nature, but
                    the manners of the age and the affectation of the day.</p>
            <p> The celebrity which <ref target="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</ref> had
                    now attained awakened the idea of extending that patronage to her which, in most
                    countries, it has been usual in one way or other to hold out to literary merit;
                    and it was thought, we must presume, the most appropriate reward of her
                    exertions, and the happiest method of fostering her genius, that she was made

                            served as lady in waiting to Charlotte, queen to <ref target="people.html#ageorgeIIIKingofGreatBritain">George III</ref>,
                            from 1786-1791.</note>
               </hi> She held this post for several years, during
                    which the duties of her situation seem to have engrossed her whole time. Her
                    state of health at length obliged her to resign it, and she was soon after
                    married to <ref target="people.html#ArblayGen">M. D'Arblay</ref>, a French
                    emigrant.</p>
            <p> She now again resumed her pen, and gave to the world her third publication,
                    entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Camilla</hi>
               </title>. This work is
                    somewhat too much protracted, <pb n="viii"/>and is inferior to <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Cecilia</hi>
               </title> as a whole, but it certainly
                    exhibits beauties of as high an order. The character of Sir Hugh is new and
                    striking. There is such an unconscious shrewdness in his remarks, that they have
                    all the effect of the sharpest satire without his intending any malice; while,
                    at the same time, his complaints are so meek, his self-humiliation so touching,
                    his benevolence so genuine and overflowing, that the reader must have a bad
                    heart who does not love while he laughs at him. The incidents of the piece show
                    much invention, particularly that which induces Sir Hugh to adopt Eugenia
                    instead of his favourite. How charmingly is Camilla described! "Every look
                    was a smile, every step was a spring, every thought was a hope, and the early
                    felicity of her mind was without alloy."</p>
            <p> Camilla, in the course of the work, falls, like Cecilia, into pecuniary
                    difficulties. They are brought on partly by milliners' bills, which
                    unawares and through the persuasion of others she has suffered to run up, but
                    chiefly from being drawn in to assist an extravagant and unprincipled brother.
                    The character of the brother, Lionel, is drawn with great truth and spirit, and
                    presents but too just a picture of the manner in which many deserving females
                    have been sacrificed to the worthless part of the family. The author appears to
                    have viewed with a very discerning eye the manners of those young men who aspire
                    to lead the fashion; and in all three of her novels has bestowed a good deal of
                    her <pb n="ix"/>satire upon the affected apathy, studied negligence, coarse
                    slang, avowed selfishness, or mischievous frolic, by which they often
                    distinguish themselves, and through which they contrive to be vulgar with the
                    advantages of rank, mean with those of fortune, and disagreeable with those of
                    youth.</p>
            <p> A very original character in this work is that of Eugenia. Her surprise and
                    sorrow when, at the age of fifteen, she first discovers her deformity, and her
                    deep, gentle, dignified sorrow for the irremediable misfortune, it is impossible
                    to peruse without sympathy; and in the incident which follows, when her father,
                    after a discourse the most rational and soothing, brings her to the sight of a
                    beautiful idiot, the scene is one of the most striking and sublimely moral any
                    where to be met with.</p>
            <p> As well as great beauties there are great faults in <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Camilla</hi>
               </title>. It is blemished by the
                    propensity which the author has shown in all her novels, betrayed into it by her
                    love of humour, to involve her heroines not only in difficult but in degrading
                    adventures. The mind may recover from distress, but not from disgrace; and the
                    situations Camilla is continually placed in with the Dubsters and Mrs. Mittin
                    are of a nature to degrade. Still more, the overwhelming circumstance of her
                    father's being sent to prison for her debts seems to preclude the
                    possibility of her ever raising her head again. It conveys a striking lesson;
                    and no doubt <ref target="people.html#ArblayMadameD">Mrs. D'Arblay</ref>,
                    in her large acquaintance with life, must have often <pb n="x"/>seen the
                    necessity of inculcating, even upon <hi rendition="#italics">young</hi> ladies,
                    the danger of running up bills on credit; but the distress becomes too deep, too
                    humiliating, to admit of a happy conclusion. The mind has been harassed and worn

               </title> than in the author's

            <p> Among the new characters in this piece is Mrs. Arlberry, a woman of fashion,
                    with good sense and taste, but fond of frivolity through <hi rendition="#italics">désœuvrement</hi>, and amusing herself with a
                    little court about her of fashionable young men, whom she at the same time
                    entertains and despises.</p>
            <p> In short, <ref target="people.html#ArblayMadameD">Mrs. D'Arblay</ref> has
                    observed human nature, both in high and low life, with the quick and penetrating
                    eye of genius. Equally happy in seizing the ridiculous, and in entering into the
                    finer feelings, her pictures of manners are just and interesting, and the
                    highest value is given to them by the moral feelings they exercise, and the
