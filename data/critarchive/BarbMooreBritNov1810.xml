                        Moore</ref> (for about this time he obtained the diploma of Doctor of physic
                    from Glasgow) was, soon after this event, engaged by the <ref target="people.html#CampbellElizabeth">Duchess of Hamilton and Argyle</ref>
                    to accompany her son, the late <ref target="people.html#HamiltonDouglas">Duke of

                    tour on the continent, in which they spent five years. After his return, he
                    removed with his family to London. </p>
            <p> Such a tour, in the maturity of life, and with <ref target="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</ref>'s genius, added to the
                    early opportunities he had enjoyed of acquaintance with the language and manners
                    of foreign countries, might be supposed to afford ample materials for
                    entertaining and informing the public; and accordingly the fruits of his travels
                    soon appeared in two volumes, entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">A View of
                            Society and Manners in France, Switzerland, and Germany</hi>
               </title>.
                    These were published in 1779, and were succeeded by <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">A View of Society and Manners in
                    Italy</hi>
               </title>, in two volumes, published 1787. These travels have been very
                    generally read, and contain both information and entertainment. Their author was
                    at once an acute and a good-natured observer of men and man- <pb n="iii"/> ners,
                    and was too much familiarized with foreign countries to exhibit the churlish
                    prejudices which the mere Englishman is apt to display on his first crossing the
                    Channel. In both these tours, entertainment has been one principal object with
                    the author, and the result of his observations on manners and character is often
                    made more lively by being mixed with anecdote, and thrown into the dramatic form
                    of dialogue. From delineations of this kind, the transition was easy to

               </title>, which appeared in 1789, placed
                    its author in the first rank of writers of that class. <ref target="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</ref>'s next publication was
                    occasioned by a visit he made to Paris with <ref target="people.html#LauderdaleJamesMaitland">Lord Lauderdale</ref> during

               </title>, which appears
                    in this selection, is one of the most entertaining we possess, from the real
                    knowledge of the world which it displays, and the humour and spirit of the
                    dialogue. It also excites no small degree of <pb n="v"/>interest. The scene is
                    laid in Italy, and the familiarity of the author with foreign manners enabled
                    him to diversify his productions with descriptions and characters beyond the
                    range of our own domestic society. This work is formed on the singular plan of
                    presenting a hero of the story, if hero he may be called, who is a finished
                    model of depravity. Zeluco is painted as radically vicious, without the
                    intermixture of any one good quality; but, if the perfectly virtuous character
                    is to be considered, for so we are sometimes told, as out of nature, "a
                    faultless monster whom the world ne'er saw,"<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> it is to be hoped a perfectly vicious character is at least as
                    extraordinary a production. There is no degree of atrocity to which human nature
                    may not arrive from time and circumstances; want and misery harden the heart as
                    well as the features: but it is scarcely conceivable that a youth coming into
                    life with every advantage of fortune and person and abilities, should never feel
                    his heart expand, amongst his youthful companions, into some kindly feeling,
                    bearing at least the semblance of benevolence. The whole character has a darker
                    tinge of villainy than is usually found in this country: it is drawn with great
                    strength, and proceeds in a regular progress of depravity, from his squeezing
                    the sparrow to death when a child, to the incident of the deadly grasp which he
                    gives his own child; a circumstance of horror new and truly tragical. It
                    reaches, like the character of Satan, the sublime of guilt. The attachment
                    between the wife and her lover is managed with great delicacy; yet if she

                    far it is favourable to good morals to interest the reader in a passion for a
                    married woman, however unhappily she may be yoked. The character of Signora
                    Sporza is drawn with spirit; it is quite a foreign one. The conversation-pieces
                    abound in humour, and show that intimate knowledge of real life and characters
                    which mere sentimental novels are generally deficient in. The quarrel between
                    the two Scotchmen about the character of their queen Mary is infinitely amusing,
                    and while it touches the national character and national partialities with the
                    hand of a friend, it at the same time exhibits them in a light truly comic.
                    Father Mulo is amusing; and there is a good deal of light humour in the story of
                    Rosolia, or rather in the manner of telling it. Much knowledge of the world and
                    good sense are exhibited in the dialogues between the hot-headed young
                    protestant divine and the colonel, whose wife he insists upon converting: the
                    death-bed of the latter is affecting, and exhibits views of piety, if not vivid,
                    at least calm and rational. It must by no means be forgotten that, to the honour
                    of the author, there is a great deal of forcible reasoning against the
                    slave-trade; and there is no stroke in <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref> of a finer pathos than the answer of the dying Hanno, when he
