               <hi rendition="#largest">A</hi> TASTE for rural scenes, in the present state of
                    society, appears to be very often an artificial sentiment, rather inspired by
                    poetry and romances, than a real perception of the beauties of nature. But, as
                    it is reckoned a proof of refined taste to praise the calm pleasures which the
                    country affords, the theme is never exhausted. Yet it may be made a question,
                    whether this ro- <pb n="160"/> mantic kind of declamation, has much effect on
                    the conduct of those, who leave, for a season, the crowded cities in which they
                    were bred.</p>
            <p>I have been led to these reflections, by observing, when I have resided for any
                    length of time in the country, how few people seem to contemplate nature with
                    their own eyes. I have "brushed the dew away"<hi rendition="#sup">

                            convicted and executed for forgery. The book was popular enough to go

               </hi> in the morning; but,
                    pacing over the printless grass, I have wondered that, in such delightful
                    situations, the sun was allowed to rise in solitary majesty, whilst my eyes
                    alone hailed its beautifying beams. The webs of the evening have still been
                    spread across the hedged path, unless some labouring man, trudging to work,
                    disturbed the fairy structure; yet, in spite of this supineness, when I
                        joined<pb n="161"/> the social circle, every tongue rang changes on the
                    pleasures of the country.</p>
            <p>Having frequently had occasion to make the same observation, I was led to
                    endeavour, in one of my solitary rambles, to trace the cause, and likewise to
                    enquire why the poetry written in the infancy of society, is most natural:
                    which, strictly speaking (for <hi rendition="#italics">natural</hi> is a very
                    indefinite expression) is merely to say, that it is the transcript of immediate
                    sensations, in all their native wildness and simplicity, when fancy, awakened by
                    the sight of interesting objects, was most actively at work. At such moments,
                    sensibility quickly furnishes similes, and the sublimated spirits combine
                    images, which rising spontaneously, it is not necessary coldly to ransack the
                    understanding or memory, till the laborious efforts of judg-<pb n="162"/>ment
                    exclude present sensations, and damp the fire of enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>The effusions of a vigorous mind, will ever tell us how far the understanding has
                    been enlarged by thought, and stored with knowledge. The richness of the soil
                    even appears on the surface; and the result of profound thinking, often mixing,
                    with playful grace, in the reveries of the poet, smoothly incorporates with the
                    ebullitions of animal spirits, when the finely fashioned nerve vibrates acutely
                    with rapture, or when, relaxed by soft melancholy, a pleasing languor prompts
                    the long-drawn sigh, and feeds the slowly falling tear.</p>
            <p>The poet, the man of strong feelings, gives us only an image of his mind, when he
                    was actually alone, conversing with himself, and marking the impression which
                    nature had made on his<pb n="163"/>own heart.—If, at this sacred moment,
                    the idea of some departed friend, some tender recollection when the soul was
                    most alive to tenderness, intruded unawares into his thoughts, the sorrow which
                    it produced is artlessly, yet poetically expressed—and who can avoid
                    sympathizing?</p>
            <p>Love to man leads to devotion—grand and sublime images strike the
                    imagination—God is seen in every floating cloud, and comes from the misty
                    mountain to receive the noblest homage of an intelligent creature—praise.
                    How solemn is the moment, when all affections and remembrances fade before the
                    sublime admiration which the wisdom and goodness of God inspires, when he is
                    worshipped in a <hi rendition="#italics">temple not made with hands</hi>, and
                    the world seems to contain only the mind<pb n="164"/> that formed, and the mind
                    that contemplates it! These are not the weak responses of ceremonial devotion;
                    nor, to express them, would the poet need another poet's aid: his heart
                    burns within him, and he speaks the language of truth and nature with resistless
                    energy.</p>
            <p>Inequalities, of course, are observable in his effusions; and a less vigorous
                    fancy, with more taste, would have produced more elegance and uniformity; but,
                    as passages are softened or expunged during the cooler moments of reflection,
                    the understanding is gratified at the expence of those involuntary sensations,
                    which, like the beauteous tints of an evening sky, are so evanescent, that they
                    melt into new forms before they can be analyzed. For however eloquently we may
                    boast of<pb n="165"/>our reason, man must often be delighted he cannot tell why,
                    or his blunt feelings are not made to relish the beauties which nature, poetry,
                    or any of the imitative arts, afford.</p>
            <p>The imagery of the ancients seems naturally to have been borrowed from
                    surrounding objects and their mythology. When a hero is to be transported from
                    one place to another, across pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural, as one
                    of the fleecy clouds on which the poet has often gazed, scarcely conscious that
                    he wished to make it his chariot? Again, when nature seems to present obstacles
                    to his progress at almost every step, when the tangled forest and steep mountain
                    stand as barriers, to pass over which the mind longs for supernatural aid; an
                    interposing deity, who walks on the waves,<pb n="166"/>and rules the storm,
                    severely felt in the first attempts to cultivate a country, will receive from
                    the impassioned fancy "a local habitation and a name."</p>
            <p>It would be a philosophical enquiry, and throw some light on the history of the
                    human mind, to trace, as far as our information will allow us to trace, the
                    spontaneous feelings and ideas which have produced the images that now
                    frequently appear unnatural, because they are remote; and disgusting, because
                    they have been servilely copied by poets, whose habits of thinking, and views of
                    nature must have been different; for, though the understanding seldom disturbs
                    the current of our present feelings, without dissipating the gay clouds which
                    fancy has been embracing, yet it silently gives the colour to the whole tenour
                    of them, and the<pb n="167"/>dream is over, when truth is grossly violated, or
                    images introduced, selected from books, and not from local manners or popular
                    prejudices. </p>
            <p>In a more advanced state of civilization, a poet is rather the creature of art,
                    than of nature. The books that he reads in his youth, become a hot-bed in which
                    artificial fruits are produced, beautiful to the common eye, though they want
                    the true hue and flavour. His images do not arise from sensations; they are
                    copies; and, like the works of the painters who copy ancient statues when they
                    draw men and women of their own times, we acknowledge that the features are
                    fine, and the proportions just; yet they are men of stone; insipid figures, that
                    never convey to the mind the idea of a portrait taken from life, where the soul
                        gives<pb n="168"/>spirit and homogeneity to the whole. The silken wings of
                    fancy are shrivelled by rules; and a desire of attaining elegance of diction,
                    occasions an attention to words, incompatible with sublime, impassioned
                    thoughts. </p>
            <p>A boy of abilities, who has been taught the structure of verse at school, and
                    been roused by emulation to compose rhymes whilst he was reading works of
                    genius, may, by practice, produce pretty verses, and even become what is often
                    termed an elegant poet: yet his readers, without knowing what to find fault
                    with, do not find themselves warmly interested. In the works of the poets who
                    fasten on their affections, they see grosser faults, and the very images which
                    shock their taste in the modern; still they do not appear as puerile or
                    extrinsic in one as the<pb n="169"/>other.—Why?—because they did not
                    appear so to the author. </p>
            <p>It may sound paradoxical, after observing that those productions want vigour,
                    that are merely the work of imitation, in which the understanding has violently
                    directed, if not extinguished, the blaze of fancy, to assert, that, though
                    genius be only another word for exquisite sensibility, the first observers of
                    nature, the true poets, exercised their understanding much more than their
                    imitators. But they exercised it to discriminate things, whilst their followers
                    were busy to borrow sentiments and arrange words. </p>
            <p>Boys who have received a classical education, load their memory with words, and
                    the correspondent ideas are perhaps never distinctly comprehended. As a proof of
                    this assertion,<pb n="170"/>I must observe, that I have known many young people
                    who could write tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets prettily together,
                    when their prose themes showed the barrenness of their minds, and how
                    superficial the cultivation must have been, which their understanding had
                    received. </p>

               <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>, I know, has given a

                    that a slight impres-<pb n="171"/>sion made on the weak faculties of a boy, is

            </p>
            <p>But, though it should be allowed that books may produce some poets, I fear they
                    will never be the poets who charm our cares to sleep, or extort admiration. They
                    may diffuse taste, and polish the language; but I am inclined to conclude that
                    they will seldom rouse the passions, or amend the heart. </p>
            <p>And, to return to the first subject of discussion, the reason why most people are
                    more interested by a scene describ-<pb n="172"/>ed by a poet, than by a view of
                    nature, probably arises from the want of a lively imagination. The poet
                    contracts the prospect, and, selecting the most picturesque part in his <hi rendition="#italics">camera</hi>, the judgment is directed, and the whole
                    force of the languid faculty turned towards the objects which excited the most
                    forcible emotions in the poet's heart; the reader consequently feels the
                    enlivened description, though he was not able to receive a first impression from
                    the operations of his own mind. </p>
            <p>Besides, it may be further observed, that gross minds are only to be moved by
                    forcible representations. To rouse the thoughtless, objects must be presented,
                    calculated to produce tumultuous emotions; the unsubstantial, picturesque forms
                    which a contemplative man gazes on, and often follows with <pb n="173"/>ardour
                    till he is mocked by a glimpse of unattainable excellence, appear to them the
                    light vapours of a dreaming enthusiast, who gives up the substance for the
                    shadow. It is not within that they seek amusement; their eyes are seldom turned
                    on themselves; consequently their emotions, though sometimes fervid, are always
                    transient, and the nicer perceptions which distinguish the man of genuine taste,
                    are not felt, or make such a slight impression as scarcely to excite any
                    pleasurable sensations. Is it surprising then that they are often overlooked,
                    even by those who are delighted by the same images concentrated by the poet?</p>
            <p>But even this numerous class is exceeded, by witlings, who, anxious to appear to
                    have wit and taste, do not allow their understandings or feel-<pb n="174"/>ings
                    any liberty; for, instead of cultivating their faculties and reflecting on their
                    operations, they are busy collecting prejudices; and are predetermined to admire
                    what the suffrage of time announces as excellent, not to store up a fund of
                    amusement for themselves, but to enable them to talk. </p>
            <p>These hints will assist the reader to trace some of the causes why the beauties
                    of nature are not forcibly felt, when civilization, or rather luxury, has made
                    considerable advances—those calm sensations are not sufficiently lively to
                    serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary, or even to the moderate pursuer of
                    artificial pleasures. In the present state of society, the understanding must
                    bring back the feelings to nature, or the sensibility must have such native
                    strength, as rather to be whetted than<pb n="175"/>destroyed by the strong
                    exercises of passion. </p>
            <p>That the most valuable things are liable to the greatest perversion, is however
                    as trite as true:—for the same sensibility, or quickness of senses, which
                    makes a man relish the tranquil scenes of nature, when sensation, rather than
                    reason, imparts delight, frequently makes a libertine of him, by leading him to
                    prefer the sensual tumult of love a little refined by sentiment, to the calm
                    pleasures of affectionate friendship, in whose sober satisfactions, reason,
                    mixing her tranquillizing convictions, whispers, that content, not happiness, is
                    the reward of virtue in this world. </p>
