						</lg></quote>picturesque, arabesque, and romanesque, it yet lacked vigour
					and variety&#8212;often abounded in carelessness, and dealt too much in the
					superficial. It bore too great a resemblance to <ref
						target="people.html#Thalaba">Thalaba</ref>&apos;s palace in the desert, a
					structure that Mr. <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>

					Sand often contains gold, yet sand makes a sorry foundation, and we have often
					wished that <ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">L. E. L.</ref> would dig
					till she reached the rock. So far from agreeing with the objections brought by
					many grave and corporate critics against the superabundance of &quot;Love&quot;
					in her verses, we have wished for more that could really deserve the
					name,&#8212;taking leave to think that the sparkling sentiment which has
					idleness and self-will for its parents, and an impersonation of moonlight and a
					serenade for bridemaids, bore passing small resemblance to intense yet rational
					feeling; real, yet not ungovernable energy of soul. Again, without going the
					length of other &quot;robustious periwigged&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note
							place="foot"><ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"
								>Shakespeare</ref>, <title><hi rendition="#italics"
								>Hamlet</hi></title> III.ii..9.</note></hi> objections raised
					against her landscape drawing, we have ventured to wish her on more familiar
					terms with lady Nature; and, finally, as she has undoubtedly founded a poetic
					school, we have unfeignedly wished that she would whip some dozen of her
					scholars. The faults of an original may be merged in the light of his beauties;
					but the faults of a copyist call for the wet sponge of annihilation. What made
					us think that <ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss Landon</ref>
					possessed &quot;powers that she had never used,&quot; were occasional lines and
					passages manifesting, not merely thought, but a capacity for speculating upon
					thought&#8212;a deeper looking into man&apos;s heart and destiny&#8212;and
					loftier aspirations after all &quot;that is very far off,&quot; than might
					beseem troubadours and improvisatrici. &apos;<title>Erinna</title>,&apos;
					notwithstanding its incorrect versification, proved that there was iron in the
					rose; the &apos;<title>Lines on Life</title>,&apos; breathed wisdom born of
					tears and nursed of truth; whilst the majority of her later poems have proved
					her in possession not only of the genii of the lamp, but of the master of the
					genii; not only of fancy, that builds with gold and gems, but of truth and
					thought, that bring the living spirit to inhabit. In that most convenient of
						places&#8212;<hi rendition="#italics">somewhere</hi>, we remember to have
					read an apologue, which, as not inapplicable, we shall narrate. When the Queen
					of Sheba went to prove King Solomon with hard questions, she appeared one day
					before him with two wreaths of flowers, the one natural, the other artificial,
					but both so apparently alike as to render her request that he would distinguish
					them at a distance somewhat difficult of performance. The wisest of men and best
					of botanists was puzzled&#8212;but, observing a bee outside one of the palace
					windows, he ordered its admission and watched is movements. The little honey
					merchant was neither to be deceived nor allured by the bright hues of the
					artificial wreath, but guided the monarch&apos;s decision by settling instantly
					on one really composed of the roses of Sharon and the lilies of the valley.
					Would that all poets allowed a bee (sympathy) to discern for them the difference
					between the false and true&#8212;<ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss
						Landon</ref> has done so of late, and if her verses have not glittered quite
					so much with diamond dust, or exhaled so much of the spice islands, the absence
					has been well supplied by fresh dews and natural brightness. It is a
					flower-garden beside a fairy tale.</p>
				<p>But it was to the prose work intended to proceed from her pen that we looked with
					most expectation, as the test, trial, and, if the truth must be told, triumph of
						<ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss Landon</ref>, and of our own
					particular opinion of her mind. The work is here; we have read it with as much
					attention as if it had been theology, and as much excitement as if it had been
					treason. To call it a novel is incorrect; plot, incident, and narrative of all
					kinds, would go into a nut, or, to be literally correct, into a walnut-shell.
					Let not lover of history and mystery, no demander of event and catastrophe, no
					old-fashioned believer in its being equally the duty of governments to put down
					plots, and of novelists to purvey them&#8212;no person who reads a book merely
					to know what happens in it, sit down to &apos;<title>Romance and
					Reality</title>.&apos; If they inquire of us, &quot;who or what is the
					Romance?&quot;&#8212;&quot;who or what is the Reality?&quot; we cannot answer,
					for the very primitive reason of not knowing. Those who care little about story,
					or who can wait for it till the third volume, will find real and delightful
					occupation in its pages. The correct title of the work would have been
						&apos;<title>Maxims and Characters</title>&apos;&#8212;for it is composed of
					essays, criticisms, sketches of life, portraits living and dead, opinions on
					manners, descriptions of feeling, all served up with so much wit that the
					authoress might never have been sad,&#8212;with so much poetic and moral feeling
					that she might never have been gay. Perused as a work of fiction, it is too
					desultory and incorrect to be satisfactory; it must be read as a brilliant, and
					sometimes profound commentary on the life of this &quot;century of
					crowds&quot;&#8212;as the result of keen and varied observation and reflection:
					in this view we cannot but esteem it a remarkable evidence of talent. We ask the
					poetry of the authoress, where, till now, dwelt the brave good sense&#8212;the
					sarcasm bitter with medicine, not poison&#8212;the remarks that, beginning in

				<quote><p>Monday and two o&apos;clock found Emily in Harley Street, rather sooner

						slight tendency to the left. She then took a seat on the hard, or, as they
						say of hounds, the hide-bound sofa&#8212;the five minutes lengthened into
						twenty, and she sought for amusement at a most literary-looking table. Alas!
						she had read the novels&#8212;for treatises she had no taste&#8212;and two
						German volumes, and three Latin, together with a scientific journal, gave
						her a cold chill. While thus employed, a red-faced, loud-voiced servant girl
						threw open the door, and howled, &apos;If you please, ma&apos;am, Master
						Adolphus has thrown the Library of Entertaining Knowledge at Master
						Alfred&apos;s head, because he tore the Catechism of Conchology;&apos; but
						before Miss Arundel could express her regret at such misapplication of
						knowledge, the girl had vanished in all the dismay of a mistake.</p>
					<p>At last Mrs. Smithson appeared. &apos;My dear Emily, you have waited&#8212;I
						forgot to tell you that I devote the early part of the day to the dear
						children&#8212;I never allow my literary and domestic duties to interfere:
						you cannot commence the important business of education too soon, and I am
						but just emerged from the study.&apos;</p>
					<p>This was a little at variance both with servant&apos;s appearance and her own
						laboured toilette, whose want of neatness was the result of hurry and bad
						taste, not of after-disorganisation. It is amazing how oppressive is the<pb
							n="794"/> cleverness of some people, as if it were quite a duty in you
						to be clever too&#8212;or, as I once heard a little child say, &apos;Oh,
						mamma, I always speak to Mrs. S. in such dictionary words!&apos;</p>
					<p>&apos;Slowly and sadly&apos; did the morning pass. Alas! for the victim of
						friendship, whom sentiment or silliness seduces into passing a long day! The
						upright sitting on the repulsive sofa&#8212;the mental exhaustion in
						searching after topics of conversation, which, like the breeze in <ref
							target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>&apos;s description of a
						calm, &apos;come not&apos;&#8212;the gossip that, out of sheer desperation,
						darkens into scandal; if ever friends or feelings are sacrificed under
						temptation too strong to be resisted, it is in the conversational pauses of
						a long day; and worst of all, a long day between people who have scarcely an
						idea or an acquaintance in common, for the one to be exchanged, or the other
						abused&#8212;communication or condemnation equally out of the question. Mrs.
						Smithson secretly pitied herself for wasting her colloquial powers on that
						social non-entity, a young lady; and Miss Arundel was somewhat bewildered by
						the march of her former friend&apos;s intellect. Divers of those elegant
						harmonies, which make musical the flight of time in London, verified the old
						rhyme, that <quote><lg type="stanza">

						creaked, and in came the author of the treatise on bats and beetles,
						followed by a blue-coated, nankeen-trousered young man, whose countenance
						and curls united that happy mixture of carmine and charcoal which constitute

						which, like a domestic east wind, &apos;sparks neither man nor beast,&apos;
						from the unhappy footman that he cursed, to the unlucky dog that he
						kicked.</p>
					<p>A minute specimen of humanity, in a livery like a jealous lover&apos;s, of
						&apos;green and yellow melancholy,&apos; announced dinner. Mr. Smithson
						stalked up to Emily, Mr. Perkins simpered up to the hostess, and they
						entered a dismal-looking parlour, whose brick-red walls and ditto curtains
						were scantily lighted by a single lamp, though it was of the last new
						patent&#8212;to which a dim fire, in its first stage of infant weakness,
						gave small assistance.</p>
					<p>Mr. Smithson, who, as member of a public office, thought that church and
						state ought to be supported,&#8212;which support he conceived to consist in
						strict adherence to certain forms,&#8212;muttered something which sounded
						much more like a growl than a grace, and dinner commenced.</p>
					<p>At the top was a cod&apos;s shoulders and head, whose intellectual faculties
						were rather over much developed; and at the bottom was soup called
						Mulligatawny&#8212;some indefinite mixture of curry powder and duck&apos;s
						feet, the first spoonful of which called from its master a look of thunder
						and lightning up the table. To this succeeded a couple of most cadaverous
						fowls, a huge haunch of mutton, raw and red enough even for an Abyssinian,
						flanked by rissoles and oyster patties, which had evidently, like Tom
							Tough,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Central speaking character

						these were followed by some sort of nameless pudding&#8212;and so much for
						the luxury of a family dinner, which is enough to make one beg next time to
						be treated as a stranger.</p>
					<p>Conversation there was none&#8212;Mr. Smithson kindly sparing the lungs of
						his friends, at the expense of his own. First, the fire was sworn
						at&#8212;then, the draught from the door&#8212;then, the poor little footboy
						was encouraged by the pleasant intelligence that he was the stupidest
						blockhead in the world. Mr. Perkins sat preserving his silence and his
						simper: and to the lady of the house it was evidently quite matter of
						habit&#8212;a sort of accompaniment she would almost have missed.</p>
					<p>The truth is, Mr. Smithson had just married some twenty years too
						late&#8212;with his habits, like his features, quite set, and both in a
						harsh mould. Young Lady! looking out for an establishment&#8212;mediating on
						the delights of a house of your own&#8212;two maids and a man, over whom you
						are set in absolute authority&#8212;do anything rather than marry a

						succeeding wives, with ten small children ready made to order&#8212;walk off
						with some tall youth, who considers a wife and a razor definitive signs of
						his growth and his sense; but shun the establishment of a bachelor who has
						hung a pendulum between temptation and prudence till the age

				<quote><p>No one person in a thousand is capable of a real passion&#8212;that
						intense and overwhelming feeling, before which all others sink into
						nothingness. It asks for head and heart&#8212;now, many are deficient in
						both. Idleness and vanity cause, in nine cases out of ten, that state of
						excitement which is called being in love. I have heard some even talk of
						their disappointments, as if such a word could be used in the plural. To be
						crossed in love, forsooth&#8212;why, such a heart could bear as many crosses
						as a raspberry tart.</p>
					<p>But Beatrice loved with all the vividness of unwasted and unworn feeling, and
						with all the confidence of youth. Proud, earnest, and enthusiastic, passion
						was touched with all the poetry of her own nature. Her lover was the idol,
						invested by her ardent imagination with all humanity&apos;s &apos;highest
						attributes.&apos; Undegraded by the ideas of flirtation, vanity, interest,
						or establishment, her love was as simple as it was beautiful. Her life had
						passed in solitude, but it had been the solitude of both refinement and
						exertion. She was unworldly, but not untaught. She had read extensively and
						variously. Much of her reading had been of a kind unusual to either her sex
						or age; but she had loved to talk<pb n="795"/> with her father on the
						subjects which engaged him; and the investigations which were to analyze the
						state of mankind, and the theories which were to ameliorate it, became to
						her matters of attraction, because they were also those of affection.</p>
					<p>Natural scenery has no influence on the character till associated with human
						feelings: the poet repays his inspiration by the interest he flings round
						the objects which inspired it. Beatrice had early learnt this association of
						nature with humanity. She was as well acquainted with the English literature
						and language as with her own; and the melancholy and reflective character of
						its poetry suited well a young spirit early broken by sorrow, and left,
						moreover, to entire loneliness. The danger of a youth so spent was, that the
						mind would become too ideal&#8212;that mornings, passed with some favourite
						volume by the dropping fountain, or beneath the shadowy ilex, would induce
						habits of romantic dreaming, utterly at variance with the stern necessities
						of life.</p>
					<p>But Beatrice had been forced into a wholesome course of active exertion.
						Obliged to think and to act for herself&#8212;to have others dependent on
						her efforts&#8212;to know that each day brought its employment, her mind
						strengthened with its discipline. The duties that excited also invigorated.
						The keen feeling, the delicate taste, were accustomed to subjection, and
						romance refined, without weakening. </p><p rendition="#center">

					<p>Beatrice was grave; silent, except when much interested; reserved, save when
						under the influence of some strong feeling; with manners whose refinement
						was that of inherently pure taste, and much mental cultivation, touched,
						too, with the native grace inseparable from the very beautiful:
						self-possessed, from self-reliance, and with a stately bearing,
						which&#8212;call it prejudice, or pride, or dignity&#8212;spoke the
						consciousness of high descent, and an unquestioned superiority. The pride of
						birth is a noble feeling.</p>
					<p>Lorraine, on the contrary, was animated&#8212;more likely to be amused than
						excited&#8212;with a general expression of indifference not easily roused to
						interest. His manners had that fine polish only to be given by society, and
						that of the best. His thoughts and feelings were kept in the
						back-ground&#8212;not from native reserve, but from fear of
						raillery&#8212;that suspicion of our hearers which is one of the first
						lessons taught in the world. His habits were luxurious&#8212;hers were
						simple; he was witty and sarcastic&#8212;she scarcely understood the meaning
						of ridicule; his rules of action were many&#8212;as those rules must be on
						which the judgments of others are to operate&#8212;hers were only those of
						right and wrong. A whole life spent in society inevitably refers its action
						to the general opinion. Beatrice, as yet, looked not beyond the action
						itself.</p>
					<p rendition="#center"

					<p>Some slight chance usually rivets the attention; it did so now. On one of the
						tablets were inscribed various names of an apparently large family, the
						dates of the different deaths singularly near to each other. Emily felt as
						if her own solitary situation had never weighted upon her thoughts till now.
						&apos;Many are kind to me, but none care for me.&apos; Youth with its
						affection an impulse and a delight, judges others by itself, and exaggerates
						its claims.</p>
					<p>Strange it is that people (unless in the way of ostentation) never value the
						blessings they possess. But if life has a happiness over which the primeval
						curse has passed and harmed not, it is the early and long-enduring affection
						of blood and habit. The passion which concentrates its strength and beauty
						upon one, is a rich and terrible stake, the end whereof is death;&#8212;the
						living light of existence is burnt out in an hour&#8212;and what remains?
						The dust and the darkness. But the love which is born in childhood&#8212;an
						instinct deepening into a principle&#8212;retains to the end something of
						the freshness belonging to the hour of its birth: the amusement
						partaken&#8212;the trifling quarrel made up&#8212;the sorrows shared
						together&#8212;the punishment in which all were involved&#8212;the plans for
						the future, so fairytale-like and so false, in which all indulged: so true
						it is that love&apos;s slightest links are its strongest!</p>
					<p>There is something inexpressibly touching in the story of Ishmael, the youth
						who was sent into the wilderness of life with his bow and his arrow,
						&apos;his hand against every man, and every man&apos;s hand against
						him.&apos; Even in our crowded, busy, and social world, on how many is this
						doom pronounced! What love makes allowances like household love?&#8212;what
						takes an interest in small sorrows and small successes like household love?
						God forgive those (and I would not even say forgive, were not Divine mercy
						illimitable,) who turn the household alter to a place of strife! Domestic
						dissension is the sacrilege of the heart. iii. 89-117.</p></quote>
