               self-will for its parents, and an impersonation of moonlight and a serenade for
               bridemaids, bore passing small resemblance to intense yet rational feeling; real, yet

               would whip some dozen of her scholars. The faults of an original may be merged in the
               light of his beauties; but the faults of a copyist call for the wet sponge of
               annihilation. What made us think that <ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss
                  Landon</ref> possessed "powers that she had never used," were occasional lines and
               passages manifesting, not merely thought, but a capacity for speculating upon
               thought—a deeper looking into man's heart and destiny—and loftier aspirations after
               all "that is very far off," than might beseem troubadours and improvisatrici.
                  '<title>Erinna</title>,' notwithstanding its incorrect versification, proved that
               there was iron in the rose; the '<title>Lines on Life</title>,' breathed wisdom born
               of tears and nursed of truth; whilst the majority of her later poems have proved her
               in possession not only of the genii of the lamp, but of the master of the genii; not
               only of fancy, that builds with gold and gems, but of truth and thought, that bring
               the living spirit to inhabit. In that most convenient of places—<hi
                  rendition="#italics">somewhere</hi>, we remember to have read an apologue, which,
               as not inapplicable, we shall narrate. When the Queen of Sheba went to prove King
               Solomon with hard questions, she appeared one day before him with two wreaths of
               flowers, the one natural, the other artificial, but both so apparently alike as to
               render her request that he would distinguish them at a distance somewhat difficult of
               performance. The wisest of men and best of botanists was puzzled—but, observing a bee
               outside one of the palace windows, he ordered its admission and watched is movements.
               The little honey merchant was neither to be deceived nor allured by the bright hues
               of the artificial wreath, but guided the monarch's decision by settling instantly on
               one really composed of the roses of Sharon and the lilies of the valley. Would that
               all poets allowed a bee (sympathy) to discern for them the difference between the
               false and true—<ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss Landon</ref> has done so
               of late, and if her verses have not glittered quite so much with diamond dust, or
               exhaled so much of the spice islands, the absence has been well supplied by fresh
               dews and natural brightness. It is a flower-garden beside a fairy tale.</p>
            <p>But it was to the prose work intended to proceed from her pen that we looked with
               most expectation, as the test, trial, and, if the truth must be told, triumph of <ref
                  target="people.html#LandonLetitia">Miss Landon</ref>, and of our own particular
               opinion of her mind. The work is here; we have read it with as much attention as if
               it had been theology, and as much excitement as if it had been treason. To call it a
               novel is incorrect; plot, incident, and narrative of all kinds, would go into a nut,
               or, to be literally correct, into a walnut-shell. Let not lover of history and
               mystery, no demander of event and catastrophe, no old-fashioned believer in its being
               equally the duty of governments to put down plots, and of novelists to purvey them—no
               person who reads a book merely to know what happens in it, sit down to
                  '<title>Romance and Reality</title>.' If they inquire of us, "who or what is the
               Romance?"—"who or what is the Reality?" we cannot answer, for the very primitive
               reason of not knowing. Those who care little about story, or who can wait for it till
               the third volume, will find real and delightful occupation in its pages. The correct
               title of the work would have been '<title>Maxims and Characters</title>'—for it is
               composed of essays, criticisms, sketches of life, portraits living and dead, opinions
               on manners, descriptions of feeling, all served up with so much wit that the
               authoress might never have been sad,—with so much poetic and moral feeling that she
               might never have been gay. Perused as a work of fiction, it is too desultory and
               incorrect to be satisfactory; it must be read as a brilliant, and sometimes profound
               commentary on the life of this "century of crowds"—as the result of keen and varied
               observation and reflection: in this view we cannot but esteem it a remarkable
               evidence of talent. We ask the poetry of the authoress, where, till now, dwelt the
               brave good sense—the sarcasm bitter with medicine, not poison—the remarks that,
               beginning in levity, die off into reflection—the <hi rendition="#italics"

               </note>—so we say, "Honour to the patriarchs, who undoubtedly all wrote in prose!"
               But for 'Romance and Reality' in prose, half our island might never have awoke from
               their dream that <ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia">L. E. L.</ref>, was an
               avatar of blue eyes, flaxen ringlets, and a susceptible heart! The counter
               conviction, that her genius is infinitely more like an arrow, barbed at one end and
               feathered at the other, will dismay a thousand fancies, the cherished growth of
               albums and sixteen. Take for example the following outline of a domestic day and a
               domestic savage; we are heathens if they would not be recognized at the foot of the
               Pyramids.</p>

               <p>Monday and two o'clock found Emily in Harley Street, rather sooner than she was
                  expected, as was evident from that silken rustle which marks a female retreat. A
                  discreet visitor on such occasions advances straight to the window or the glass:
                  Emily did the latter; and five minutes of contemplation ascertained the fact that
                  her <hi rendition="#italics">capote</hi>
                  <note>Though the word more often means a long cloak, in this case it seems more

                  on the hard, or, as they say of hounds, the hide-bound sofa—the five minutes
                  lengthened into twenty, and she sought for amusement at a most literary-looking
                  table. Alas! she had read the novels—for treatises she had no taste—and two German
                  volumes, and three Latin, together with a scientific journal, gave her a cold
                  chill. While thus employed, a red-faced, loud-voiced servant girl threw open the
                  door, and howled, 'If you please, ma'am, Master Adolphus has thrown the Library of
                  Entertaining Knowledge at Master Alfred's head, because he tore the Catechism of
                  Conchology;' but before Miss Arundel could express her regret at such
                  misapplication of knowledge, the girl had vanished in all the dismay of a
                  mistake.</p>
               <p>At last Mrs. Smithson appeared. 'My dear Emily, you have waited—I forgot to tell
                  you that I devote the early part of the day to the dear children—I never allow my
                  literary and domestic duties to interfere: you cannot commence the important
                  business of education too soon, and I am but just emerged from the study.'</p>
               <p>This was a little at variance both with servant's appearance and her own laboured
                  toilette, whose want of neatness was the result of hurry and bad taste, not of
                  after-disorganisation. It is amazing how oppressive is the<pb n="794"/> cleverness
                  of some people, as if it were quite a duty in you to be clever too—or, as I once
                  heard a little child say, 'Oh, mamma, I always speak to Mrs. S. in such dictionary
                  words!'</p>
               <p>'Slowly and sadly' did the morning pass. Alas! for the victim of friendship, whom
                  sentiment or silliness seduces into passing a long day! The upright sitting on the
                  repulsive sofa—the mental exhaustion in searching after topics of conversation,
                  which, like the breeze in <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>'s
                  description of a calm, 'come not'—the gossip that, out of sheer desperation,
                  darkens into scandal; if ever friends or feelings are sacrificed under temptation
                  too strong to be resisted, it is in the conversational pauses of a long day; and
                  worst of all, a long day between people who have scarcely an idea or an
                  acquaintance in common, for the one to be exchanged, or the other
                  abused—communication or condemnation equally out of the question. Mrs. Smithson
                  secretly pitied herself for wasting her colloquial powers on that social
                  non-entity, a young lady; and Miss Arundel was somewhat bewildered by the march of
                  her former friend's intellect. Divers of those elegant harmonies, which make
                  musical the flight of time in London, verified the old rhyme, that <quote>

                  symptomatic of four—the bellman tolling the knell of the post announced five—and,
                  at length, a heavy hard-hearted rap proclaimed the return of Mr. Smithson; a gruff
                  voice was hear in the passage—a ponderous step on the stairs—the door and his
                  boots creaked, and in came the author of the treatise on bats and beetles,
                  followed by a blue-coated, nankeen-trousered young man, whose countenance and
                  curls united that happy mixture of carmine and charcoal which constitute the

                  solemn-looking, with a mouth made only to swear, and a brow to scowl—a tyrant in a
                  small way—one who would be arbitrary about a hash, and obstinate respecting an
                  oyster—one of those tempers which, like a domestic east wind, 'sparks neither man
                  nor beast,' from the unhappy footman that he cursed, to the unlucky dog that he
                  kicked.</p>
               <p>A minute specimen of humanity, in a livery like a jealous lover's, of 'green and
                  yellow melancholy,' announced dinner. Mr. Smithson stalked up to Emily, Mr.
                  Perkins simpered up to the hostess, and they entered a dismal-looking parlour,
                  whose brick-red walls and ditto curtains were scantily lighted by a single lamp,
                  though it was of the last new patent—to which a dim fire, in its first stage of
                  infant weakness, gave small assistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smithson, who, as member of a public office, thought that church and state
                  ought to be supported,—which support he conceived to consist in strict adherence
                  to certain forms,—muttered something which sounded much more like a growl than a
                  grace, and dinner commenced.</p>
               <p>At the top was a cod's shoulders and head, whose intellectual faculties were
                  rather over much developed; and at the bottom was soup called Mulligatawny—some
                  indefinite mixture of curry powder and duck's feet, the first spoonful of which
                  called from its master a look of thunder and lightning up the table. To this
                  succeeded a couple of most cadaverous fowls, a huge haunch of mutton, raw and red
                  enough even for an Abyssinian, flanked by rissoles and oyster patties, which had
                  evidently, like Tom Tough,<note>Central speaking character of a song by <ref

                  deal of service:' these were followed by some sort of nameless pudding—and so much
                  for the luxury of a family dinner, which is enough to make one beg next time to be
                  treated as a stranger.</p>
               <p>Conversation there was none—Mr. Smithson kindly sparing the lungs of his friends,
                  at the expense of his own. First, the fire was sworn at—then, the draught from the
                  door—then, the poor little footboy was encouraged by the pleasant intelligence
                  that he was the stupidest blockhead in the world. Mr. Perkins sat preserving his
                  silence and his simper: and to the lady of the house it was evidently quite matter
                  of habit—a sort of accompaniment she would almost have missed.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Mr. Smithson had just married some twenty years too late—with his
                  habits, like his features, quite set, and both in a harsh mould. Young Lady!
                  looking out for an establishment—mediating on the delights of a house of your
                  own—two maids and a man, over whom you are set in absolute authority—do anything
                  rather than marry a confirmed bachelor—venture on one who has been successful with
                  seven succeeding wives, with ten small children ready made to order—walk off with
                  some tall youth, who considers a wife and a razor definitive signs of his growth
                  and his sense; but shun the establishment of a bachelor who has hung a pendulum
                  between temptation and prudence till the age of——; but of all subjects, age is the

            <p>L. E. L.'s "takings" are for the most part "friendly and complimentary"—nevertheless,
               some are so caustic, that, unless she omits them in a second edition, it might be
               well to publish a literary copy of the advertisement to Rowland's
                  Kalydor,<note>Rowland's Kalydor, a patent preparation for the complexion, was
                  advertised as producing relaxation and dispelling irritability.</note>
               particularly that part which states its soothing qualities for "gentlemen whose chins
               are tender after shaving." Against her second edition, too, or, rather against her
               next work, we would remind her, that what has been said of bagpipe music may be said
               of witticisms where too numerous—"the one half would sound better for the other half
               not being heard." The first volume is as full of points as a packet of needles, and,
               as the writer says of some one's attitude, fails of being easy by being elaborate.
               This over-abundance of repartees, similes, and epigrams, becomes tiresome to the
               dull, and teazing to the quick; makes wit look too like hard work, and the author too
               much resemble a vivacious juggler—a <quote>

               dignified, even as an author, requires no less moral courage than to be so in daily
               life. Ridicule is society's fear of God, and entertainment its "pearl of great

               exempt from all the faults of the two others; there is no want of story, which is so
               concentrated in its pages, that, with a little introduction, and the entire smother
               of the Higgs' family, it might be printed separately, a perfectly true, pure,
               pleasant specimen of fiction. It is effective, without effect being strained after,
               and contains passages full of power, beauty, and simplicity. The epigrammatic style
               is dropped; the narrative flows sweetly yet sadly along; and the history of the grave
               and noble Beatrice—of the self-will and repentings of the less firmly strung Emily,
               would redeem an Almack's of young ladies, and "a wilderness of monkeys."<note>

                  </title> III.i.122-3.</note> We give a specimen from this part of the work:—</p>
            <quote>
               <p>No one person in a thousand is capable of a real passion—that intense and
                  overwhelming feeling, before which all others sink into nothingness. It asks for
                  head and heart—now, many are deficient in both. Idleness and vanity cause, in nine
                  cases out of ten, that state of excitement which is called being in love. I have
                  heard some even talk of their disappointments, as if such a word could be used in
                  the plural. To be crossed in love, forsooth—why, such a heart could bear as many
                  crosses as a raspberry tart.</p>
               <p>But Beatrice loved with all the vividness of unwasted and unworn feeling, and with
                  all the confidence of youth. Proud, earnest, and enthusiastic, passion was touched
                  with all the poetry of her own nature. Her lover was the idol, invested by her
                  ardent imagination with all humanity's 'highest attributes.' Undegraded by the
                  ideas of flirtation, vanity, interest, or establishment, her love was as simple as
                  it was beautiful. Her life had passed in solitude, but it had been the solitude of
                  both refinement and exertion. She was unworldly, but not untaught. She had read
                  extensively and variously. Much of her reading had been of a kind unusual to
                  either her sex or age; but she had loved to talk<pb n="795"/> with her father on
                  the subjects which engaged him; and the investigations which were to analyze the
                  state of mankind, and the theories which were to ameliorate it, became to her
                  matters of attraction, because they were also those of affection.</p>
               <p>Natural scenery has no influence on the character till associated with human
                  feelings: the poet repays his inspiration by the interest he flings round the
                  objects which inspired it. Beatrice had early learnt this association of nature
                  with humanity. She was as well acquainted with the English literature and language
                  as with her own; and the melancholy and reflective character of its poetry suited
                  well a young spirit early broken by sorrow, and left, moreover, to entire
                  loneliness. The danger of a youth so spent was, that the mind would become too
                  ideal—that mornings, passed with some favourite volume by the dropping fountain,
                  or beneath the shadowy ilex, would induce habits of romantic dreaming, utterly at
                  variance with the stern necessities of life.</p>
               <p>But Beatrice had been forced into a wholesome course of active exertion. Obliged
                  to think and to act for herself—to have others dependent on her efforts—to know
                  that each day brought its employment, her mind strengthened with its discipline.
                  The duties that excited also invigorated. The keen feeling, the delicate taste,
                  were accustomed to subjection, and romance refined, without weakening. </p>
               <p rendition="#center"> *               *               *               *</p>
               <p>Beatrice was grave; silent, except when much interested; reserved, save when under
                  the influence of some strong feeling; with manners whose refinement was that of
                  inherently pure taste, and much mental cultivation, touched, too, with the native
                  grace inseparable from the very beautiful: self-possessed, from self-reliance, and
                  with a stately bearing, which—call it prejudice, or pride, or dignity—spoke the
                  consciousness of high descent, and an unquestioned superiority. The pride of birth
                  is a noble feeling.</p>
               <p>Lorraine, on the contrary, was animated—more likely to be amused than excited—with
                  a general expression of indifference not easily roused to interest. His manners
                  had that fine polish only to be given by society, and that of the best. His
                  thoughts and feelings were kept in the back-ground—not from native reserve, but
                  from fear of raillery—that suspicion of our hearers which is one of the first
                  lessons taught in the world. His habits were luxurious—hers were simple; he was
                  witty and sarcastic—she scarcely understood the meaning of ridicule; his rules of
                  action were many—as those rules must be on which the judgments of others are to
                  operate—hers were only those of right and wrong. A whole life spent in society
                  inevitably refers its action to the general opinion. Beatrice, as yet, looked not
                  beyond the action itself.</p>
               <p rendition="#center">*               *               *               *</p>
               <p>Some slight chance usually rivets the attention; it did so now. On one of the
                  tablets were inscribed various names of an apparently large family, the dates of
                  the different deaths singularly near to each other. Emily felt as if her own
                  solitary situation had never weighted upon her thoughts till now. 'Many are kind
                  to me, but none care for me.' Youth with its affection an impulse and a delight,
                  judges others by itself, and exaggerates its claims.</p>
               <p>Strange it is that people (unless in the way of ostentation) never value the
                  blessings they possess. But if life has a happiness over which the primeval curse
                  has passed and harmed not, it is the early and long-enduring affection of blood
                  and habit. The passion which concentrates its strength and beauty upon one, is a
                  rich and terrible stake, the end whereof is death;—the living light of existence
                  is burnt out in an hour—and what remains? The dust and the darkness. But the love
                  which is born in childhood—an instinct deepening into a principle—retains to the
                  end something of the freshness belonging to the hour of its birth: the amusement
                  partaken—the trifling quarrel made up—the sorrows shared together—the punishment
                  in which all were involved—the plans for the future, so fairytale-like and so
                  false, in which all indulged: so true it is that love's slightest links are its
                  strongest!</p>
               <p>There is something inexpressibly touching in the story of Ishmael, the youth who
                  was sent into the wilderness of life with his bow and his arrow, 'his hand against
                  every man, and every man's hand against him.' Even in our crowded, busy, and
                  social world, on how many is this doom pronounced! What love makes allowances like
                  household love?—what takes an interest in small sorrows and small successes like
                  household love? God forgive those (and I would not even say forgive, were not
                  Divine mercy illimitable,) who turn the household alter to a place of strife!
                  Domestic dissension is the sacrilege of the heart. iii. 89-117.</p>
