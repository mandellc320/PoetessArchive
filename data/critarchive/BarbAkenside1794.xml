                    its own sake, it <milestone unit="signature" n="B" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="2"/>was natural to esteem the Didactic, as in that view it certainly is,
                    as a species of inferior merit compared with those which are more peculiarly the
                    work of the imagination; and accordingly in the more splendid era of our own
                    Poetry it has been much less cultivated than many others. Afterwards, when
                    Poetry was become an art, and the more obvious sources of description and
                    adventure were in some measure exhausted, the Didactic was resorted to, as
                    affording that novelty and variety which began to be the great desideratum in
                    works of fancy. This species of writing is likewise favoured by the diffusion of
                    knowledge, by which many subjects become proper for general reading, which in a
                    less informed state of society, would have savoured of pedantry and abstruse
                    speculation. For Poetry cannot descend to teach the elements of any art or
                    science, or confine itself to that regular arrangement and clear brevity which
                    suits the communication of unknown truths. In fact, the Muse would <pb n="3"/>make a very indifferent school-mistress. Whoever therefore reads a Didactic
                    Poem ought to come to it with a previous knowledge of his subject; and whoever
                    writes one, ought to suppose such a knowledge in his readers. If he is obliged
                    to explain technical terms, to refer continually to critical notes, and to
                    follow a system step by step with the patient exactness of a teacher, his Poem,
                    however laboured, will be a bad Poem. His office is rather to throw a lustre on
                    such prominent parts of his system as are most susceptible of poetical ornament,
                    and to kindle the enthusiasm of those feelings which the truths he is conversant
                    with are fitted to inspire. In that beautiful Poem the <title>Essay on

                    system, is little attended to, but those passages which breathe the love of
                    Virtue are read with delight, and fix themselves on the memory. Where the reader
                    has this previous knowledge of the subject, which we have mentioned as

               <pb n="4"/>the Poet becomes itself a source of
                    pleasure, and sometimes in proportion to the remoteness of the subject from the
                    more obvious province of Poetry; we are delighted to find with how much
                    dexterity the artist of verse can avoid a technical term, how neatly he can turn
                    an uncouth word, and with how much grace embellish a scientific idea. Who does

                    His verse is a piece of mechanism as complete in its kind as that which he
                    describes. Allured perhaps too much by this artificial species of excellence,
                    and by the hopes of novelty, hardly any branch of knowledge has been so
                    abstruse, or so barren of delight as not to have afforded a subject to the
                    Didactic Poet. Even the loathsomeness of disease and the dry maxims of medical
                    knowledge have been decorated with the charms of Poetry. Many of these pieces
                    however owe all their entertainment to frequent digressions. <pb n="5"/>Where
                    these arise naturally out of the subject, as the description of sheep-shearing

                    to the man of taste, for otherwise all attempts to make it so by adventitious
                    ornaments, will be but like loading with jewels and drapery a figure originally

                    Imagination is the <pb n="6"/>very source and well-head of Poetry, and nothing
                    forced or foreign to the Muse could easily flow from such a subject. Accordingly
                    we see that the author has kept close to his system, and has admitted neither
                    episode nor digression: the allegory in the second book, which is introduced for
                    the purpose of illustrating his theory, being all that can properly be called
                    ornament in this whole Poem. It must be acknowledged however, that engaging as
                    his subject is to minds prepared to examine it, to the generality of readers it
                    must appear dry and abstruse. It is a work which offers us entertainment, but
                    not of that easy kind amidst which the mind remains passive, and has nothing to
                    do but to receive impressions. Those who have studied the metaphysics of mind,
                    and who are accustomed to investigate abstract ideas, will read it with a lively
                    pleasure; but those who seek mere amusement in a Poem, will find many far

                    not sufficiently adverted to, the latter being only slightly mentioned in the
                    preface to the Poem. It is not meant however to insinuate that <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    communicating to their disciples. Thus prepared, by nature with genius, and by

            <p>After this clear and concise definition, and a lively and appropriate invocation
                    to the powers of Fancy guided by Truth and Liberty, the Author begins by
                    unfolding the Platonic idea that the universe with all its forms of material
                    beauty was called into <pb n="11"/>being from its pototype [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>], existing from all eternity in the divine
                    mind. The different propensities that human beings are born with to various
                    pursuits, are enumerated in some very beautiful lines, and <hi rendition="#italics">those</hi> are declared to be the most noble which lead
                    a chosen few to the love and contemplation of the supreme beauty by the love and
                    contemplation of his works. The Poet thus immediately, and at the very outset,
                    dignifies his theme, by connecting it with the sublimest feelings the human mind
                    is capable of entertaining, feelings without which the various scenes of this
                    beautiful universe degenerate into gaudy shows, fit to catch the eye of
                    children, but uninteresting to the heart and affections; and those laws and
                    properties about which Philosophy busies herself, into a bewildering mass of
                    unconnected experiments and independent facts. These lines afford more than one
                    example of climax, graceful repetition, and richness of poetic language. The
                    subject is then branched out into the three grand divisions marked <pb n="12"/>by <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    of being laboured into excellence, but rather of being thrown off at once amidst
                    the swell and fervency of a kindled imagination. The final cause of each of
                    these propensities is happily insinuated; of the sense of the sublime, to lead
                    us to the contemplation of the Supreme Being; of that of novelty to awaken us to

            <p>The genius of the one was clouded over with the deepest glooms of Calvinism, to
                    which system however he owed some of his most striking beauties. The religion of
                    the other, all at least that appears of it, and all indeed that could with
                    propriety appear in such a Poem, is the purest Theism: liberal, cheerful, and
                    sublime; or, if admitting any mixture, he seems inclined to tincture it with the
                    mysticism of <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    who, when they have abandoned the tenets of orthodoxy can scarcely bear to
                    re-peruse him; the other, dealing more in general truths, will always be read

            <p>The Poem goes on to trace the connection of beauty with truth, by shewing that

                    the fitness of the object to the use for which it is intended, and serves as a

                    perfection of the form in which it resides. This leads him on to speak of moral
                    beauty, and tracing the regular gradations of beauty through colour, shape,
                    symmetry, and grace, to its highest character in the expression of moral

                    philosophy and high sense of liberty he was equally enamoured. It is easy for

                    very prone) may be attributed the mention of the courtly compliments which
                    debased the verse of <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    of Passion is next considered, and the mysterious pleasure which is mixed with

                    purport of the visions. The figures of Pleasure and Virtue are in a good measure

               </hi> is
                    wrought up with much strength of colouring. The story is in fact the
                    introduction of evil, accounted for by the necessity of training the pupil of
                    Providence to the love of Virtue, the supreme good, by withdrawing from him for
                    a while the allurements of pleasure; but why his very suffering should be
                    attended with pleasure, which was the phenomenon to be accounted for, is not so
                    clearly made out. We are told indeed that the youth is willing to bear the
                    frowns of the son of <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#Nemesis">Nemesis</ref>

                    for the future, whenever, supported by Virtue, he sustains a combat with Pain.
                    So far indeed we may gather from this representation, that pleasure is always
                    annexed to the exercise of our moral feelings, which is probably the true
                    account of the matter: but this truth is rather darkened than illustrated by the

            <p>But he has not kept his promise: neither indeed could he, for besides that no one
                    was ever less capable than our author of <hi rendition="#italics">unbending</hi>, the object of <pb n="23"/>his disquisition is not to make us
                    laugh, but to tell us why we laugh: a very different problem and very remote
                    from any ideas of pleasantry. Nor could he without violating uniformity, change
                    the measure of his Poem, otherwise this part of his subject not affording any
                    play for the higher beauties and bolder sweep of blank verse, would have been
                    better treated of in the neat and terse couplet, after the manner of <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>
               </hi>'s Ethical Epistles, or <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#YoungEdward">Young</ref>
               </hi>'s Satires. He
                    begins, agreeably to the system he had embraced, with deducing all deviations
                    from rectitude or propriety, from false opinions, imbibed in early youth, which
                    attract the imagination by fallacious shows of good. Of these false opinions the
                    more serious lead to vice, while those which refer to the less important
                    particulars of our conduct betray to ridicule, the source of which is <hi rendition="#italics">incongruity</hi>, and its final cause the assisting the
                    tardy deductions of reason by the quick impulse of an instinctive sense. </p>
            <pb n="24"/>
            <p>The theory is beautiful and well supported. Illustrations of every different
                    species of the ridiculous are given in the Poem, the notes are judicious, and
                    tend still more to elucidate the subject. Still it must be confessed the theme
                    is not a poetical one; and it may be even questioned how far it is connected
                    with the subject; for the sense of ridicule is of a very peculiar nature, and is
                    hardly included, in common language, among the Pleasures of the Imagination. If
                    however the reader is inclined to be dissatisfied with this part of his
                    entertainment, let him recollect, that if it affords him less pleasure, it
                    probably cost the author more pains than any other portion of his Poem. It is
                    asserted that under the appellation of <hi rendition="#smcaps">Momion</hi>,<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot">

               </hi> the writer has thrown

               </hi> for surely no man
                    of a just moral taste can reflect without regret that a capital work of one of
                    our best Poets, composed in the height of his reputation, and during the <pb n="25"/>perfection of all his powers, should have no other end than to
                    gratify the spleen of an offended author, and to record the petty warfare of
                    rival wits. It is an observation of the excellent <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#HartleyDavid">Hartley</ref>
               </hi>, that those studies
                    which confine the mind within the exercise of its own powers, as criticism,
                    poetry, and most philological pursuits, are apt to generate a supercilious
                    deportment and an anxious and selfish regard to reputation: whereas the pursuit
                    of truth, carrying the mind <hi rendition="#italics">out</hi> of itself to large
                    views of nature and Providence, fills it with sublime and generous feelings. The
                    remark must undoubtedly be taken with great latitude, but it seems to be not
                    entirely unfounded. </p>
            <p>Having dismissed the account of Ridicule, so little susceptible of being adorned
                    by his efforts, the Poet rises into a higher strain, and investigates that
                    wonderful phenomenon from whence the Pleasures of Imagination chiefly seem to
                    arise, the mysterious connection of moral ideas with visible objects. <pb n="26"/>Why, he asks, does the deep shade of a thick wood strike us with religious
                    awe? Why does the lightsomeness and variety of a more airy landscape suggest to
                    us the idea of gaiety and social mirth? Is there really any resemblance, or is
                    it owing to early and frequent associations? He decides for the latter, and
                    beautifully illustrates that great law on which the power of memory entirely
                    depends. This leads him to consider the powers of Imagination as residing in the
                    human mind, when, after being stored by means of memory, with ideas of all that
                    is great and beautiful in nature, the child of fancy combines and varies them in
                    a new creation of its own, from whence the origin of Music, Painting, Poetry,
                    and all those arts which give rise to the secondary or reflex pleasures,
                    referred to in the latter part of his definition. This is accompanied by a
                    glowing and animated description of the process of composition, written
                    evidently with the pleasure a person of genius must have felt, when reflecting
                    with <pb n="27"/>conscious triumph that he is exercising the powers he so well
                    describes. He had probably likewise in his eye the well-known lines of <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    we receive from all that strikes us with the sensation of Beauty in the material
                    world. Concerning this there exists two opinions. One, that those objects we
                    call beautiful are so really and in their own nature, and must appear so to any
                    being possessed of faculties capable of appreciating them. The other that beauty
                    is a mere arbitrary thing, a sort of pleasing enchantment spread over the face
                    of nature, a delusion, under which we see charms that do not at all result from
                    the real properties of things, and which other intelligent beings it is pro-<pb n="28"/>bable do not perceive. This latter opinion our author has embraced
                    as the most philosophical. It is not, we presume, the most pleasing, nor the
                    most favourable to the dignity and importance of the Pleasures of Imagination;
                    for their boasted connection with <hi rendition="#italics">truth</hi> vanishes,
                    except indeed in this sense that beauty as an arbitrary mark is used with
                    precision, and is constantly found to denote the health and soundness of the
                    object in which it appears to reside, and consequently is made subservient to
                    utility; but the beautiful climax is destroyed by which the inferior kinds are
                    connected with moral beauty, for how can what is real be connected with what is
                    imaginary? unless indeed, what would be a very dangerous doctrine, the sense of
                        <hi rendition="#italics">moral beauty</hi> itself were supposed to be
                    dependent on our peculiar formation, and adapted only to our present state of
                    existence. The Poet has here closely copied from <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>
               </hi>, both in opening
                    the thought, and in the simile with which he illustrates it. He loses sight
                    however of this unpoetical philosophy towards <pb n="29"/>the conclusion, where
                    having observed that <hi rendition="#italics">taste</hi> results from the
                    natural quickness of all the perceptions he has enumerated, strengthened by
                    adequate culture, he observes, that culture will not however destroy the
                    peculiar bias which is impressed upon different minds towards the great, or the
                    soft and beautiful. This he exemplifies in <hi rendition="#smcaps">

            <p>Much more might be said of the philosophy of this Poem, but the chief aim of this
                    Essay is to shew the poetical use he has made of his subject. Many <pb n="30"/>of the divisions might perhaps be differently arranged, and the theory in some
                    instances improved, but for Poetry it is sufficiently accurate, and in
                    speculations of this shadowy nature, no person will be thoroughly content with
                    even his own system after the lapse of any considerable portion of time. </p>

               </hi> be to be estimated from this Poem, and it is
                    certainly the most capital of his works, it will be found to be lofty and
                    elegant, chaste, classical, and correct: not marked with strong traits of
                    originality, not ardent nor exuberant. His enthusiasm was rather of that kind
                    which is kindled by reading and imbibing the spirit of authors, than by
                    contemplating at first hand the works of nature. As a versifier <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</ref>
               </hi> is allowed to stand amongst those who have given the
                    most finished models of blank verse. His periods are long but harmonious, the
                    cadences fall with grace, and the measure is supported with uniform <pb n="31"/>dignity. His Muse possesses the <hi rendition="#italics">mien erect, and high

               </hi> We shall scarcely find a low or trivial expression
                    introduced, a careless or unfinished line permitted to stand. His stateliness
                    however is somewhat allied to stiffness. His verse is sometimes feeble through
                    too rich a redundancy of ornament, and sometimes laboured into a degree of
                    obscurity from too anxious a desire of avoiding natural and simple expressions.

                    superior to the compositions of his cotemporary [<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>] <hi rendition="#smcaps">

               </hi>, though inferior to his finest passages. It is indeed too
                    equal not to be in some degree monotonous. He is fond of compound epithets, led
                    to it perhaps by his fondness for the Greek, and delights in giving a classic
                    air to his composi-<pb n="32"/>tions by using names and epithets the most remote
                    from vulgar use. Like <hi rendition="#smcaps">
                  <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref>
               </hi>'s gods his poetry speaks a different language
                    from that of common mortals. </p>
            <p>That an author who lived to near fifty should have produced his most capital work
                    at three and twenty, seems to imply (as his professional studies did not cause
                    him to lay aside his poetical pursuits) a genius more early than extensive, a
                    mind more refined than capacious. And that this was the case in reality, will
                    appear from his having employed himself during several years in correcting and
                    entirely new moulding this his favourite Poem. To correct to a certain degree is
                    the duty of a man of sense, but always to correct will not be the employment of
                    a man of spirit. It betrays a mind rather brooding with fond affection over old
                    productions, than inspired by a fresh stream of new ideas. The flowers of fancy
                    are apt to lose their odour by much handling, the glow is gone and the ear
                    itself after a certain time loses its tact amidst repeated <pb n="33"/>alterations, as the taste becomes confounded by the successive trial of
                    different flavours. </p>
            <p>The Edition which he was preparing was however left in too imperfect a state to
                    justify its being presented to the public, at least of superseding the complete
                    one which is here given, and which passed rapidly through many editions soon
                    after its first appearance. In the posthumous Poem the ordonnance is greatly
                    changed: <hi rendition="#italics">Novelty</hi> is left out as a primary source
                    of the Pleasure of the Imagination, and placed among the adventitious
                    circumstances which only increase it: the greatest part of the lines on Ridicule
                    are also omitted, and he has abandoned the idea of its being the test of truth,
                    an idea which had given offence to the severer moralists. Instead of the
                    allegory of Virtue and <hi rendition="#smcaps">

                    read it through: as, <milestone unit="signature" n="D" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="34"/>for the author's purpose, it is too short, since it breaks off
                    so abruptly, that though the purport is declared to be to shew the origin of
                    evil, the story is not far enough advanced to allow the reader even to guess at
                    the intended solution. Of the fourth book the beginning is barely sketched. But
                    had the whole been completed, we may venture to pronounce that, if the system
                    was improved, the Poetry would have been weaker. He has amplified what had
                    before a tendency to be redundant; he has rendered abstruse what was before
                    sufficiently difficult of comprehension: and in proportion as he has departed
                    from the chaste elegance of <hi rendition="#smcaps">

               </hi> he has given to
                    his subject a dry scholastic air, and involved it in metaphysical subtleties. Of

                  <ref target="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</ref>
               </hi> as one of those
                    few born to <hi rendition="#italics">create</hi> an era in Poetry, we may well
                    consider him as formed to shine in the brightest; we may venture to predict that
                    his work, which is not formed on any local or temporary subject, will continue
                    to be a classic in our language; and we shall pay him the grateful regard which
                    we owe to genius exerted in the cause of liberty and philosophy, of virtue and
                    of taste. </p>
