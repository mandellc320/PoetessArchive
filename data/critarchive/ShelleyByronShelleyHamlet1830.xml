            <p><hi rendition="#large">I</hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">t</hi> was indeed a delightful
               day. We had spent the hot time under some of the old, over-canopying chestnuts of the
               Grand Duke's wood; and perceiving now the green and golden light of sunset through
               the valleys of tree-tops, we began to wind our way home through the wilderness of
               underwood, following the track of a little path or sheepwalk, which led though the
               forest, as it gradually opened, and ended in the stately avenue of the Grand Duke's
               palace. Here, in the wide space, under those lofty trees, we were no longer
               constrained to walk singly, and <ref target="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</ref>
               placed himself beside <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Lord Byron</ref>, who led
               the way through the trees: "You seem very ineffable this evening," said he. </p>
            <p>"I have been reading," he replied, "<title>Hamlet</title>."</p>
            <p>"No wonder then you are melancholy."</p>
            <p>"No," said <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Lord Byron</ref>, "'tis not so much
               melancholy, but I feel perplexed, confused, and inextricably self-involved; a
               nightmare sensation of impotence and vain endeavour weighs upon me, whether my own or
                  <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref>'s. Nor do I at all
               recognize in my feelings that calmness and grandeur which you said the other day one
               always felt in the presence of great genius."</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. I understand you! 'Tis a feeling one but too
               often feels; when an object stands before one, unintelligible, "wrapped in its own
               formless horror like a ghost."<note>Paraphrase of <ref

            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. I don't wonder you quote that line of yours. It
               is one of the best you ever wrote. I think it great affectation not to quote oneself. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. But you must not let <title>Hamlet</title>
               pass. Pray go on with your observations upon it, if not disagreeable. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. It takes some time for one's feelings to form
               themselves into any definite and expressible shapes—just as they say that it takes
               three days for the rain-water to get to the rivers—one for the ground, one for the
               drains, and one for the ditches: and it is very hard of any one to come as you do
               now, and trampling over one's feelings, while they are yet soft with the drenching of
               your Castalian dew, to stamp uneffaceably the impression of the moment. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Oh, I assure you we wont print you down at
               your word. You may say just the contrary, if it please your Lordship, to-morrow; but
               sufficient for the evening is the opinion thereof. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Why, believe me, I have no opinion of any sort.
               If I had but an opinion—what can any man want more? But now I am like a nothing, a
               want, a privation. What <hi rendition="#italics">is</hi><ref
                  target="people.html#Hamlet"> Hamlet</ref>? What means he? Are we, too, like him,
               the creatures of some incomprehensible sport, and the real universe just such another
               story, where all the deepest feelings, and dearest sympathies are insulted, and the
               understanding mocked? And yet we live on, as we read on, for <quote><lg type="stanza">

                  </lg></quote> And who can read this wonderful play without the profoundest
               emotion? And yet what is it but a colossal enigma? We love <ref
                  target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref> even as we love ourselves. Yet consider
               his character, and where is either goodness or greatness? He betrays <ref
                  target="people.html#Ophelia">Ophelia</ref>'s gentlest love; he repulses her in a
               cruel manner; and when in the most touching way, she speaks to him, and returns his
               presents, he laughs her off like a man of the town. At her grave, at the new-made
               grave of <ref target="people.html#Ophelia">Ophelia</ref> his first love, whom his own
               unkindness had blasted in the very bud of her beauty, in the morn and liquid dew of
               youth, what is the behaviour of <ref target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref>? A
               blank—worse than a blank; a few ranting lines, instead of true feeling, that prove
               him perfectly heartless. Then his behaviour in the grave, and his insult to <ref
                  target="people.html#Laertes">Laertes</ref>, why the gentlest verdict one can give
               is insanity. But he seems by nature, and in his soberest moods, fiend-like in
               cruelty. His old companions <ref target="people.html#RosencrantzGuildenstern"
                  >Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</ref>, he murders without the least compunction; he
               desires them to be put to sudden death, "not shriving-time allowed."<note><hi

               some more horrid time, "when he is drunk, asleep, or in his rage,"<note><hi

            <p>But suppose him heartless, though he is for ever lamenting, and complaining, and
               declaiming about the false-heartedness of every one else; Richard is

               "unlike <ref target="people.html#Hercules">Hercules</ref>" as possible. He does not,
               as a great and energetic mind does, exult under the greatness of a grand object. He
               is weak; so miserably weak as even to complain of his own weakness. He says

            <p>And yet he is always boasting and bragging of his own powers, and scorning every one

               himself with laughing at himself, mocking his own conscious cowardice, and venting
               his spleen in names, instead of doing any thing like a man. So irresolute is he, that

                  >Ophelia</ref>, how gross are the scenes of her madness! She, too, seems as
               inconsistent and as false a character as her faithless lover. The graceful and gentle
                  <ref target="people.html#Ophelia">Ophelia</ref> changes somehow or other as shapes
               change in a dream, into an insane gypsy, singing no very delicate songs. <ref

            <p>"Alas! poor ghost!" said <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>. "I had
               forgot it, but the ghost is as whimsical a person as any of the others. It seems to
               come and go without any reason at all. Why should it make all that bustle in the
               cellarage when it cries out 'Swear!'<note><hi rendition="#italics"
                        ><title>Hamlet</title></hi> Act I, scene v.</note> in echo to <ref

               consistency, or art, in the wild rhapsodies of this uncultivated genius." </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Are you then so orthodox in any thing as to
               think <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> a man of no art
               or thought—a prophet of poetry, possessed by a spirit unintelligible to himself?</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. My dear fellow, who can read this very play, and
               call <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> a thoughtful
               artist? Let us rise a little higher, and consider the whole play, and the play as a
               whole. The story, the action, after the first prologue and preparation of this ghost,
               remain stagnant; all the rest is stationary, episodical, useless. What is Fortinbras
               to the usurpation of the King, or the revenge of <ref target="people.html#Hamlet"
                  >Hamlet</ref>, or any part of the plot? nor do <ref target="people.html#Ophelia"
                  >Ophelia</ref> or <ref target="people.html#Polonius">Polonius</ref> conduce to the
               main of the story, or to the progress of the interest. Add <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >quantum suff.</hi><note>Shortened for <hi rendition="#italics">quantum
                     sufficit</hi>- a sufficient quantity.</note> of courtiers, players,
               grave-diggers, clowns, and such like stuff, ridiculous and incongruous,<pb n="330"
               />and out of all keeping with the high-heeled, tragic strut; useless, in truth, in
               relation to the play considered in itself; but I suppose poor <ref
                  target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Will</ref> found sufficient use and reason
               in the pence and praises of the gods of the galleries. And thus this will-o'th-wisp,
               this meteor of genius, leads us poor mortals, who would fain analyze his nature and
               detect his "airy purposes," a weary and a fruitless chase; while the simpler solution
               of the difficulty would be, that <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"
                  >Shakspeare</ref> was a man of great genius but no art, and much preferred
               satisfying his hostess of the Mermaid with a good night's profit, to satisfying the
               troublesome and inquisitive readers of future ages, which he dreamed not of." </p>
            <p>This seemed to make <ref target="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</ref> melancholy,
               and we walked in silence through the arched gateway into the public road; nothing was
               heard but the echo of our steps. I felt a kind of sorrow and mournful shame, as if
               the glory of man was proved indeed to be the "dream of a shadow." "But," said <ref
                  target="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</ref>, beginning again, with the kind of
               wedgelike, thin voice with which a man brings in a solid argument that he is sure of,
               "What do you exactly mean by a great genius without art? do you mean a man who throws
               out in his writings some odd passages of great beauty, but leaves the whole, as a
               whole, rude and unformed?" </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Take it that way, if you will.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Well then, what do we mean by a beautiful
               passage or line? Is not a line, as well as your outspread heroics, or a tragedy, a
               whole, and only as a whole, beautiful in itself? as, for instance, "How sweet the
               moonlight sleeps upon this bank."<note><ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"
                     >Shakespeare</ref>, <hi rendition="#italics"><title>The Merchant of
                        Venice</title></hi> Act V, scene i, line 54.</note> Now, examining this
               line, we perceive that all the parts are formed in relation to one another, and that
               it is consequently a whole. "Sleep," we see, is a reduplication of the pure and
               gentle sound of sweet; and as the beginning of the former symphonizes with the
               beginning <hi rendition="#italics">s</hi> of the latter, so also the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">l</hi> in moonlight prepares one for the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">l</hi> in sleep, and glides gently into it; and in the
               conclusion, one may perceive that the word "bank" is determined by the preceding
               words, and that the <hi rendition="#italics">b</hi> which it begins with is but a
               deeper intonation of the two <hi rendition="#italics">p</hi>'s which come before it;
               sleeps upon this slope, would have been effeminate; sleeps upon this rise, would have
               been harsh and inharmonious.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Heavens! do you imagine, my dear <ref
                  target="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</ref>, that <ref
                  target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> had any thing of the kind
               in his head when he struck off that pretty line? If any one had told him all this
               about your p's and s's, he would just have said, "Pish!" </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Well, be that as it may, are there not the
               coincidences, I suppose you would call them, that I showed in the line? </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. There are. But the beauty of the line does not
               lie in sounds and syllables, and such mechanical contrivances, but in the beautiful
               metaphor of the moonlight sleeping. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Indeed, that also is very beautiful. In every
               single line, the poet must organize many simultaneous operations, both the meaning of
               the words and their emphatic arrangement, and then the flow and melting together of
               their symphony; and the whole must also be united with the current of the rythm [<hi
                  rendition="#italics">sic</hi>]. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Well, then, I'm glad I'm not a poet! It must be
               like making out one's expenses for a journey, I think, all this calculation! </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. I don't say that a poet must necessarily be
               conscious of all this, no more than a lady is conscious of every graceful move-<pb
                  n="331"/>ment. But I do say that they all depend upon reason, in which they live
               and move, and have their being; and that he who brings them out into the light of
               distinct consciousness, beside satisfying an instinctive desire of his own nature,
               will be more secure and more commanding. But what makes this metaphor beautiful? To
               represent the tranquillity of moonlight is the object of the line; and the sleep is
               beautiful, because it gives a more intense and living form of the same idea; the
               rythm beautifully falls in with this, and just lets the cadence of the emphasis dwell
               upon the sound and sense of the sweet word "sleep;" and the alliteration assimilates
               the rest of the line into one harmonious symmetry. This line, therefore, is it not
               altogether a work of art?</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. If it is, I don’t see what this has to do with
               the discussion about <title>Hamlet</title></p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Why, just this. You recollect, you said <ref
                  target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> was a great genius with
               no art? </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Yes. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. And that you meant by that, a man who would
               strike out two or three good lines, and purple patches of poetry in his work, but who
               leaves the whole unfinished? </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Yes. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. And we afterwards agreed that every line, or
               part of a line, that was good, was made good by art only? </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Well! </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Why, then, this is the conclusion, that a man
               of great genius, but little art, means only, one who is able to perceive in the small
               what his powers are not wide enough to comprehend in the greater. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Byron</hi>. Well, well—for heaven's sake, what does it
               signify about the words, art, or genius? This does not explain <title>Hamlet</title>. </p>
            <p><hi rendition="#italics">Shelley</hi>. Only that, if what I have said is true, and if
                  <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> is one of the most
               glorious names among mankind, and <title>Hamlet</title> one of his most famous plays,
               it is more than probable that he was not so blind as you would make him; and that
               there must be some point of view, if we could find it, some proper distance and happy
               light, in which the whole would appear a beautiful whole. I once attempted a kind of
               commentary upon this very play, and if you will allow me, I will read it to you.</p>
            <p><ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</ref>, though half provoked and half
               amused, with what he thought the mad and ridiculous speculations and imaginations of

                  >Shelley</ref> read us out his view of <ref target="people.html#Hamlet"
                  >Hamlet</ref>:—</p>
            <p>"The character of <ref target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref> himself we must first
               endeavour to penetrate into, and if we can understand this central germ, we shall be
               better able to follow the poet in the conception and organization of his great work,
               and to see how every part is what it is necessarily, and bears in itself the reason
               of its existence and its form.</p>
            <p>"The character of <ref target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref>, as I take it,
               represents the profound philosopher; or, rather, the errors to which a contemplative
               and ideal mind is liable: for of necessity the lessons of the tragic poet are like
               the demonstrations, <hi rendition="#italics">ex absurdo</hi>,<note>From absurdity or
                  from extremes.</note> of <ref target="people.html#Parmenides">Parmenides</ref>,
               since the mind's eye is so dull and blinded, so 'drunk-asleep,' to use <ref
                  target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref>'s words, as not by intuition to recognize
               the beauty of virtue, to prove it, as it were, by the clashing contradiction of the
               two opposite extremes: as, if a man derived a more sensible, or rather sensual,
               consciousness of health,<pb n="332"/>which also is indeed a gift of the same Apollo
               who bestows upon us truth and beauty, from having been previously in sickness:— there
               is but one demonstration of the excellence of health, and that is disease. </p>
            <p>"Purposing, therefore, to body forth a character so deeply, indeed, and pre-eminently
               tragic, but most hard to fix and bring down into the definite world of action, as it
               seemed to lie beyond it in the sphere of thought, silent and invisible, <ref
                  target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref> invented the sublime idea
               of the ghost; an outward and visible sign of the sudden apparitions of the mysterious
               world within us. The ghost of his father, clad in complete steel, revisiting the
               glimpses of the moon, may be considered as a great purpose coming suddenly upon a
               meditative mind. All the outward circumstance and actual reality, of course,
               immediately become necessary as the laws and conditions of the visible world into
               which it is translated. Now <ref target="people.html#Hamlet">Hamlet</ref> the father
