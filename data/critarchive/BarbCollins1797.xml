               <hi rendition="#largest">T</hi>HE different species of Poetry may be reduced under
               two comprehensive classes. The first includes all in which the charms of verse are
               made use of, to illustrate subjects which in their own nature are affecting or
               interesting. Such are Didactic and Dramatic compositions. Such is the Epic, where a
               story, a series of adventures, carries the reader on through the impulse of
               curiosity, and loses not its interest intirely even if translated into Prose. Such
               are descriptions of natural objects, where the mind recognizes with pleasure the
               forms and colouring it admires in the various <milestone n="a" unit="signature" rendition="center"/>
               <pb n="iv"/>scenes and productions of the visible world. Such is, also, that moral
               painting of men and manners, that spontaneously approves itself to the spirit of
               observation, and the moral sense, that more or less are implanted in the breast of
               every man. Hence the Essays and Epistles of <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">Pope</hi>
               </ref> have been popular among all that read. A lively representation of the <hi rendition="#italics">passions</hi>, particularly those of love, terror, and pity,
               commands the attention even of those who are but indifferent judges of the vehicle in
               which it may be conveyed. The other class consists of what may be called pure Poetry,
               or Poetry in the abstract. It is conversant with an imaginary world, peopled with
               beings of its own creation. It deals in splendid imagery, bold fiction, and
               allegorical personages. It is necessarily obscure to a certain degree; because,
               having to do chiefly with ideas generated within the mind, it cannot be at all
               comprehended by any whose intellect has not been exercised in similar contemplations;
               while the conceptions of the Poet (often highly metaphysical) are rendered still <pb n="v"/>more remote from common apprehension by the figurative phrase in which they
               are clothed. All that is properly <hi rendition="#italics">Lyric Poetry</hi> is of
               this kind. It depends for effect on the harmony of the verse, which must be modulated
               with the nicest care; and on a felicity of expression, rather than a fullness of
               thought. An Epic Poem may be compared to a piece of massy plate finely wrought; it is
               intrinsically valuable, though its value is much increased by the work bestowed upon
               it. An Ode, like a delicate piece of silver filligree, receives in a manner all its
               value from the art and curiosity of the workmanship. Hence Lyric Poetry will very
               seldom bear translation, which is a kind of melting down of a Poem, and reducing it
               to the sterling value of the matter contained in it. Who can read the greatest part
               of the Odes of <ref target="people.html#Horace">
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">Horace</hi>
               </ref> in any translation that has yet appeared? and who, but a native of France,
               reads, what a native of France reads with rapture, the Odes of <ref target="people.html#RousseauJeanBaptiste">

               artifice of construction, to work it up into a beautiful piece; and to judge of or
               relish such a composition requires a practised ear, and a taste formed by elegant
               reading. <ref target="people.html#Moliere">

               felicity; his works are small in bulk, but highly finished; and have deservedly

               tenderness, tin-<pb n="vii"/>ged with melancholy, beautiful imagery, a fondness for
               allegory and abstract ideas, purity and chasteness of sentiment, and an exquisite ear
               for harmony. In his endeavours to embody the fleeting forms of mind, and clothe them
               with correspondent imagery, he is not unfrequently obscure; but even when obscure,
               the reader who possesses congenial feelings is not ill pleased to find his faculties

               inclined to indolence; but it is likewise true that the man of fine imagination who
               draws his productions from the stores of his own mind, ought to have large allowance
               made before this accusation is fixed upon him. A real Poet must always appear
               indolent to the man of the world. The alacrity and method of business is not to be
               expected in his occupation. His mind works in silence, and exhausts itself with the
               various emotions which it che-<pb n="viii"/>rishes, while to a common eye it appears
               fixed in stupid apathy. The Poet requires long intervals of ease and leisure; his
               imagination should be fed with novelty, and his ear soothed by praise. But it was not

               was unhappy; his mind, abandoned to inaction, preyed upon itself, and he fell into

               judges, and have opened sources of new and striking imagery which succeeding Poets
               have often availed themselves of. The passions of men are uniform; but, modified by
               the influence of climate, government, manners, and local circumstance, and
               accompanied with the various tints which employ the pencil of a landscape painter,
               they present an inexhaustible variety, from the song of <hi rendition="#smcaps">Solomon</hi> breathing of cassia, myrrh, and cinnamon, to the Gentle Shepherd of

               </title>, stands upon a ground of superior merit. There is a peculiar strength of
               painting in the opening of the Poem. The horror of a <pb n="xiii"/>boundless desart,
               arid and sultry, the intense beams of noon, the absence of all vestige of vegetation,
               the undulating ocean of sand swept by the rising whirlwind, present a scenery of
               gloomy grandeur strictly appropriate to the country. A single group appears upon the
               canvass, composed of laden camels, so emphatically called in the East the ships of
               the desart, pursuing their painful march through a cloud of dust, and the driver
               Hassan, with his single cruise of water, and fan made of feathers, who is represented
               striking his breast with his hand, according to the eastern expression of strong
               emotion, before he begins his complaint. The scene is highly finished, and shews what
               advantage might be gained to this kind of Poetry, by studying the more picturesque
               features of nature. This piece is a monodrame, but the apostrophe to the camels, and
               the introduction of the speech of Hassan's mistress, give it sufficient dramatic
               effect. The danger incurred in these desarts from poisonous reptiles and wild beasts
               is strikingly impressed: <pb n="xiv"/>

               known to grow wild in many parts of Persia, is discovered by Abbas the Great, sultan

               of the surrounding shepherds. As the narrative is put into the mouth of another
               Georgian maiden, who relates it among her companions, there should have been some
               return to her at the close of the piece, without which we are apt to forget that

               become so, pecuniary distress. The idea of building a temple to Pity, on the walls of
               which should be painted a variety of tragic subjects, might, if the Poet had

               </hi> are finely imagined. It is difficult to keep intirely separate the active and
               passive qualities of allegorical personages: difficult to say whether such a being as
               Fear should be the agent in inspiring, or the victim agitated by the passion. In this
               Ode the latter idea prevails, for Fear appears in the character of a nymph pursued,
               like <hi rendition="#smcaps">Dryden</hi>'s Honoria, by the ravening <pb n="xxi"/>brood of Fate. She is distracted by the ghastly train conjured up by Danger, and
               hunted through the world without being suffered to take repose; yet this idea is
               somewhat departed from, when the Poet endeavours to <hi rendition="#italics">propitiate</hi> Fear by offering her as a suitable abode, <hi rendition="#italics">the cell where Rape and Murder dwell;</hi> or a cave, whence
               she may hear <hi rendition="#italics">the cries of drowning seamen</hi>.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> She then becomes the power who delights in inflicting fear. But perhaps the
               reader is an enemy to his own gratification, who investigates the attributes of these
               shadowy beings with too nice and curious an eye. In his reference to the goblins of
               Midsummer eve, the Poet shews that disposition to take advantage of the traditionary
               superstitions of his country, which he afterwards indulged more fully in his
                  <title>Ode on the Highland Superstition</title>; a piece he did not live to
               finish. The division of this Ode into Epode and Antistrophe is no advantage to it.
               The change of measure is so violent from the Lyric to the Elegiac, that in fact they
               make two different Poems; and the terms themselves, not be-<milestone n="b 2" unit="signature" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="xxii"/>ing supported, as among the ancients, by any adaptation of musical
               accompaniments, are in our Poetry totally unmeaning. The complimentary valediction so

               </hi> is in this instance but a compliment; for however a man might be content to
               have his days tinged with the soft influence of a penseroso-melancholy; he could not,
               for any reward, wish to subject himself habitually to the distracting emotions of

               </title> is chiefly distinguished by a smoothness and uniformity of melody, adapted
               to the sober nature of the subject. It chiefly insists on the power of Simplicity in
               touching the heart, and its necessary connection with Liberty: the latter, though a
               sentiment we have early imbibed, is probably imaginary. The Poet is obliged to
               include the Augustan age of writers under the votaries of Simplicity, and how few
               were the Poets whom the Romans had to boast of before that period? Where <ref target="people.html#CollinsWilliam">

               <title>
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">On the Poetical Character</hi>
               </title>. This is one of the most difficult and perhaps least satisfactory of the
               Odes. It begins with an ingenious comparison drawn from <hi rendition="#smcaps">Spenser</hi>. As the girdle of Florimel, though apparently within the reach of
               all, would not fit any but the virtuous fair destined to wear it; so the girdle of
               Fancy, the magic cestus of poetic powers, can only be worn by him whom Nature has
               cast in the mould of true genius. So far is apt and intelligible; but the Poet
               afterwards, actuated as it should seem by a vague desire of exalting his favorite
               occupation, rather than by any clear and distinct ideas, goes on to say how this
               cestus was produced. His allegory here is neither luminous nor decent. The Supreme
               Being, he tells us, being in a <hi rendition="#italics">diviner mood than

               nothing was yet created,) and placed her on his throne, sitting with her there alone;
               in the mean time <pb n="xxiv"/>music was heard from behind the veil; the sun,

               went forward, this magic web, the cestus, was woven: and who after this account, he

               floated in the mind of the Author was this, that true Poetry being a representation
               of Nature, must have its archetype in those ideas of the supreme mind, which
               originally gave birth to Nature; and therefore, that no one should attempt it without

            <p>The hyacinthine locks of the Spartans, though an expression very classic, has, to an
               English reader, more of sound than sense in it; especially if referred, as it is
               here, to the colour; yet the magic of numbers is such that the passage cannot be read
               without pleasure, and <pb n="xxx"/>the allusion to the custom the Spartans had of
               arranging their hair before a battle, is just and happy.</p>
            <p> Beautiful as is this Ode, the philosophic reader will find much to object to. The
               ideas of Liberty referring to ancient states, are formed upon those splendid notions,
               which are imbibed in early youth, and are little applicable to the real and practical
               principles of just legislation. The practice of slavery alone completely destroys, in
               all those states who used it, all pretence to the blessings of fair and equal
               government; and there exists no country where the stern regulations of power entered,
               more than at Sparta, into every scene of private life. The parent could not there
               exercise the sacred and inalienable right of education; nor the husband enjoy his
               home. And with regard to religious liberty, so dear to every ingenuous and inquiring
               mind, it was not even thought of in the Grecian States. As to Rome, the Author has
               fallen into the anachronism common to the admirers of antiquity, of confounding the
               times of the republic with <pb n="xxxi"/>those of the empire; in order, by blending
               the glories of each, to delight the imagination with an era more free than the later,

               </hi> which pervades all his Poems, appears with much grace in this address to
               Evening, where it peculiarly suits the sober and quiet character of that season. But
               notwithstanding its superior merit considered as a Poem, in the chief object of its
               construction this Ode will probably be considered rather as a literary curiosity than
               as a successful pattern of a new mode of versification. The imagination indeed is
               gratified, but the ear is disappointed; nor is this merely the effect of custom. So
               long as our verse is constructed chiefly with iambics, particularly in the close of
               the line, the absence of rhyme will appear a defect; but Lyric measures might be
               formed composed of dactyls and anapæsts, which would probably sustain themselves

               objection to this, and it is to be feared an insuperable one, is, that our language
               does not naturally run into these measures, and the genius of a language cannot be
               forced. Those who think no practice can have the stamp of taste which has not the
               sanction of the antients, will continue to inveigh against rhyme; writers, studious
               of novelty, will, from time to time, make attempts to do without it; but we may
               venture to pronounce it far from probable, that the mode in which the great masters
               of English versification, from <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">

               be the offspring of tasteless caprice, or the blind compliance with unmeaning custom.
               It is moreover a fact, which those who have tried it will bear witness to, that the
               necessity of labouring the line and turning the expressions frequently in the mind,
               is favorable to excellence; and, that, whatever might be presumed to the contrary, a
               thought is oftener condensed than di-<pb n="xxxiv"/>lated by the necessity of putting
               it into rhyme. Our common blank verse is so extremely easy to compose, that it tempts
               a young author to negligence. The art of versification is as essential to the nature
               of Poetry as beauty of thought; and however difficult it may be to bind in rhyme the
               unwilling phrase, the Poet should remember that he cannot free himself from a chain,
               but by abandoning an ornament.</p>

               has not, like his predecessors, taken advantage of a story for the basis of his
               piece; but has raised it solely on an allegorical fiction of his own. The Passions,
               who had often crowded round the cell of Music, while she sung in early Greece, being
               once upon a time more than usually affected, and raised into a kind of extacy,
               snatched her instruments which hung upon the surrounding myrtles, and produced, each
               of them, a strain suitable to the peculiar expression of his character. The Passions

               <pb n="xxxviii"/>lancholy. Joy is preceded by Cheerfulness; and Love, all-powerful
               Love, is only mentioned incidentally. The reader may perhaps expect from the frame of
               the piece that an appropriate instrument should be found for every passion, as in the
               ingenious paper of <hi rendition="#smcaps">Addison</hi>, in which characters are
               resembled to musical instruments. This however is not the case. To some of the
               passions no particular instrument is assigned. Anger and Joy have two, and the horn,
               though with "an altered tone" is common to Melancholy and Cheerfulness. The aim of
               the Poet was rather to describe them by their manner of playing, than by a
               circumstance which, if extended to every one, might have given rather a formal air to
               the Poem, and allied it more to wit than to fancy. In the order in which they are
               brought forward, the sole view seems to have been that they should relieve one
               another; Melancholy is followed by Cheerfulness; the song of Hope is broken off by
               Revenge; and <hi rendition="#italics">his</hi> movements are contrasted by those of

               line has a fine effect; it seems to shew Revenge entering like a stern conqueror

               and we have already observed how <pb n="xl"/>well it is contrasted with that of Pity.
               Jealousy is more feebly drawn, but Melancholy is in his softest, mellowest stile of

               </hi> Is it because the nature of man is less formed for rapture, than for moderate
               exhilaration, that when the Poet endeavours to rise from Cheerfulness to Joy, the
               images are less distinct, and the effect less forcible? The unaccountable exclusion
               of Love from the trial has already been<pb n="xli"/>noticed; but surely, if he was
               mentioned at all, it should have been as a principal, and not introduced dancing like

               from whatever cause, certain it is that he has shewn himself rather unfriendly to the

            <p>It is a test of merit, and not a symptom of defect in this Ode, as has been surmised
               by some critic, that its beauties are brought out by recitation. No composition in
               the language is more admirably adapted to display with effect the different
               modulations of impassioned sentiment and imitative harmony, and it is remarkable that
               this is effected not by a studious adaptation of <pb n="xlii"/>particular measures to
               the expression of different passions, for the same measure is often used for opposite
               passions; but by that skilful mixture of them, by those graceful cadences and
               judicious breaks, and sounds conveying the tone of feeling to which the ear of a Poet
               is his best guide. The allegory is simply this, that the <hi rendition="#italics">art</hi> of music supplies the instruments, but that the Passions alone can make
               them speak to the heart; and the piece concludes with lamenting the dissolution of
               that union which is said to have subsisted in antient times between Poetry and Music.
               Of the wonderful effects of this union, every one perhaps is not prepared to affirm
               with our Author, "'Tis said, and I <hi rendition="#italics">believe</hi> the tale;"
               but every person of taste must lament its divorce from <hi rendition="#italics">sense</hi>, and regret, that while the English language offers to the composers
               of music such productions as the preceding for the basis of their exertions, the

               </hi> suspended to bid his gentle spirit rest, the gradual fading of the scenery as

               </ref> a Druid or a pilgrim, characters totally foreign to his own. To the sanguinary
               and superstitious Druid, whose rites were wrapped up in mystery, it was peculiarly
               improper to compare a Poet whose religion was simple as truth, sublime as nature, and
               liberal as the spirit of philosophy. <hi rendition="#italics">Nature's child</hi> is

               commemorate, nor does there seem to be any local acquaintance with the scenery, for
               the church of Richmond is not white nor a spire, nor can it be seen from the river;
               and as to the monument erected in the last verse to this <pb n="xliv"/>great Poet, it
               must be looked upon in the light of a prophecy which is not yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p> There remain two or three smaller Poems, among which the dirge in Cymbeline deserves
               to be noticed as perfectly corresponding with the delicacy and sweetness of the play

               and probably the Author, who died in 1756, never enjoyed spirits sufficient to finish

               enumerated with equal taste and knowledge of the subject. The imagination of <ref target="people.html#CollinsWilliam">
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">Collins</hi>
               </ref> was apt to kindle at whatever bore the impress of the strange, the wild, and
               especially the supernatural; no <pb n="xlvi"/>wonder therefore he was struck with the
               tales of the second sight, the elf-shot arrows, the island of pigmies, &amp;c. in
               which the northern part of our island abounds. The information is chiefly taken from

               </ref>, though it is not one of the few on which his reputation will more

            <p> The reader, after thus going through the productions of <ref target="people.html#CollinsWilliam">
                  <hi rendition="#smcaps">Collins</hi>
               </ref>, must have formed his opinion of the powers of the writer. He will be
               acknowledged to possess imagination, sweetness, bold and figurative language. His
               numbers dwell upon the ear, and easily fix themselves in the memory. His vein of
               sentiment is by turns tender and lofty, always tinged with a degree of melancholy,
               but not possessing any claim to originality. <hi rendition="#italics">His</hi>
               originality consists in his manner; in the highly figurative garb in which he clothes
               abstract ideas; in the felicity of his expressions; and his skill in embodying ideal
               creations. He had much of the mysticism of Poetry, and sometimes became obscure, by
               aiming at impressions stronger than he had clear and well-defined ideas to support.
               Had his life <pb n="xlix"/>been prolonged, and with life had he enjoyed that ease and
               health which is necessary for the undisturbed exercise of the faculties, he would
               probably have risen far above most of his contemporaries. As it was, he did not enjoy
               much of the public favor; but posterity has done him justice, and assigned him an
               honorable rank among those of our Poets who are more distinguished by excellence than
               by bulk.</p>
