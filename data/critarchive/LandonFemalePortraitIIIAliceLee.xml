               </hi> is a wide step—it passes over the
					greater portion of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter</ref>'s
					life—they belong indeed to periods as widely different as they are widely
					apart. <title>Marmion</title> belongs to the spring, <title>Woodstock</title> to
					the autumn. The one is fresh, eager, and impetuous, there are the winds of
					March, and the flowers of April; it abounds with that prodigality of power and
					beauty which belongs to the year's first and lavish season. The other has
					the same power and the same beauty—but the exercise of the one is skilful,
					and the display of the other mellowed. But it is in the writer's self that
					the chief change is found—many a hue has faded from the
					landscape—many a green leaf turned yellow since the exquisite
					introductions ushered in the various cantos. Many a pulse, too, has lost its
					elasticity—many a warm quick emotion sleeps to awaken no more: the heart
					loses its youth while the mind is in all its vigour. In one of the memoranda of
					the deeply-affecting journal in the last volume of "<ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s Life," he
					observes:—"People say that the whole human frame in all its parts and
					divisions, is gradually, in the act, decaying and renewing. What a curious
					timepiece it would be that could indicate to us the moment this gradual and
					insensible change had so completely taken place that no atom was left of the
					original person who had existed at a certain period, but there existed in his
					stead another person having the same thews and sinews, the same face and
					lineaments, the same consciousness—a new ship built on an old
					plank—a pair of transmigrated stockings like those of <ref target="people.html#CutlerJohn">Sir John Cutler</ref>, all green without one
					thread of the original black left! singular, to be at once another and the
						same."<hi rendition="#sup">

               <pb n="483"/>Yet these were the circumstances under which
						<title>Woodstock</title>, one of the most striking and original of his
					works, was produced. The history of most fictions would be far stranger than the
					fictions themselves; but it would be a dark and sad chronicle. Half the works
					that constitute the charm of our leisure, that give their own interest to the
					long November evening, or add to the charm of a summer noon beneath the
					greenwood tree, are the offspring of poverty and of pain. <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref> wrote
						<title>Rasselas</title> to pay the last decent respect of the living to the
					dead—his mother's funeral expenses. How often is the writer obliged
					to put his own trouble, his suffering, or his sorrow aside, to finish his task!
					The hand may tremble, the eyes fill with unbidden tears, and the temples throb
					with feverish pain, yet how often is there some hard and harsh necessity, which
					says, "the work must be done." Readers, in general, think little of
					this: they will say, "Dear! how delightful to be able to write such
					charming things! how it must amuse you!" I believe if there were only the
					author's amusement in the case it would fall very short of their own; not
					but what composition has its moments of keen and rapid delight when the scene
					rises vividly before you, and the mind is warm with the consciousness of its own
					powers: but these are only "angel visits," they do not form the staple
					of any work. Literature soon becomes a power, not what it once was, a passion;
					but literary success, like all others, is only to be obtained, and retained, by
					labour—and labour and inclination do not always go together. Take all our
					most eminent writers, and the quantity of work, hard work, they have got
					through, will be found enormous and perpetual. Literature, as a profession,
					allows little leisure, and less indulgence. The readers are the gainers: to them
					how little difference does it make that <title>Marmion</title> was written in
					youth, health, and prosperity; while <title>Woodstock</title> was the weary task
					of breaking health, and broken fortunes—their amusement is the same! But
					even to the most careless, a deeper interest is thrown around these volumes, and
					every little touch of individuality seems like the familiar intercourse of a
					friend. <ref target="people.html#LockhartJohn">Lockhart</ref> says in the
					Memoir, "I know not how others interpreted various passages in
						<title>Woodstock</title>, but there were not a few that carried deep
					meaning, for such of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>'s
					own friends as were acquainted with, not his pecuniary misfortunes alone, but
					the drooping health of his wife, and the consolation afforded him by the dutiful
					devotion of his daughter Anne, in whose character and demeanour a change had
					occurred exactly similar to that painted in poor Alice Lee—'a light
					joyous air, with something of a humorous expression, which seemed to be looking
					for amusement, had vanished before the touch of affection, and a calm melancholy
					had supplied its place, which seemed on the watch to administer comfort to
						others.'"<hi rendition="#sup">

               </quote> And every appearance of Alice Lee is a picture. We see her first in the
					shadowy twilight, the light step of youth subdued to the heavier tread of age;
					and in the dialogue that follows, with what force, and yet what delicacy, we are
					made acquainted with the innermost recesses of the maiden's heart! Alice is
					at the most interesting period of a woman's existence—when the
					character is gradually forming under circumstances that develop all latent
					qualities. The rose has opened to the summer—the girl has suddenly become
					a woman.</p>
            <p>Alice Lee's predominate feeling is attachment to her father: her love for
					her cousin is a gentle and quiet love; it belongs to the ease and familiarity of
					childhood; it is constantly subdued by a rival and holier sentiment.
					Alice's devotion to her father is not merely the fulfilment of a duty, it
					is a warmer and keener emotion—there is pity and enthusiasm blended with
					her filial piety—she sees the kind-hearted old man bowed by adversity,
					mortified in all those innocent vanities which sit closely to every heart; his
					old age is deprived of those comforts with which youth may dispense—but
					which are hard to lose when they are, and have long been, matters both of right
					and habit. No wonder that his child clings to him with a deeper, sadder,
					tenderness. Who can avoid bringing the picture home to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> himself? his difficulties seem
					peculiarly adapted to awaken the most painful sympathy. They came upon him in
					his old age, yet were met with the noblest spirit of resistance. From the time
					that he felt labour to be a duty—with what unflinching earnestness did he
					set about that labour! Not even when working to achieve the dearest objects of
					his ambition—to become the master of Abbotsford—to settle an eldest
					and beloved son in life—did <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> exert himself as he did when the exertion was for his
					creditors. It seems doubly hard when we think how much others had to do with the

            <p>While on this subject, may I be permitted a few words concerning one to whose
					memory but harsh and scanty justice has been allotted—I allude to the late
						<ref target="people.html#ConstableArchibald">Mr. Constable</ref>? Perhaps I
					may be biassed by the recollection of kindness extended to myself when very
					young. <ref target="people.html#ConstableArchibald">Mr. Constable</ref> was the
					first publisher with whom I had ever any communication. His peculiarly kind and
					courteous manner (I went to visit some near relatives in the North under his
					escort) left an indelible impression. I was then a child in everything,
					especially judgment; and would as little now venture to pronounce on affairs of
					which I can know nothing. But I may be allowed to dwell on the general
					benevolence of <ref target="people.html#ConstableArchibald">Mr.
					Constable</ref>'s character. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir
						Walter Scott</ref> particularly remarks, that <ref target="people.html#ConstableArchibald">Constable</ref>'s individual
					expenses were moderate, and within what his income would have seemed to justify:
					if he failed, it was in the cause of that literature to which he devoted himself
					with an enthusiasm of an order far beyond the mere <pb n="485"/>speculations of
					profit. There must have been delicacy, as well as generosity, in the mind that
					concealed from the author any comparative failure in the sale of his works, lest
					it should damp his genius. Look what its first great publisher did for the
					publishing trade in Edinburgh; with him it rose into existence and prosperity,
					and with him it died. He originated our first periodical—and, both in
					literature and in politics, what vast influence has been, and is exercised by
					the "<title>
                  <ref target="people.html#EdinburghReview">Edinburgh
							Review</ref>
               </title>!" He, too, was the first person who saw the
					growing demand of the public mind for intellectual food; and the plan of cheap
					publication, so general now, and profitable to so many, was <ref target="people.html#ConstableArchibald">Mr. Constable</ref>'s idea. In
					his long career, how many owed to him kindness and assistance—and how
					melancholy were its closing scenes! The body destroyed—the mind broken
					down: such was the close of the great publisher—and of the great
					author!</p>
            <p>"<title>Woodstock</title>" belongs to a better time. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> felt his powers vigorous as
					ever—and no one could imagine and dwell upon such a creation as Alice Lee,
					and not be the better and the happier. Every time she appears on the scene she
					brings with her an atmosphere of purity and beauty. How lovely is the scene
					conjured up in the little hut, when the evening hymn disturbs, but to make
					musical, the silence of the forest glades; and the words of faith and hope,
					cheering the gentle and maiden heart, which was their worthy temple! Again, in
					what a noble and high spirit is her rejection of Charles's ungenerous suit.
					Only one of a school, whose profligacy was the cold result of vanity, could have
					insulted a purity so simple and so apparent, by dishonourable affection. But it
					is mockery to use the word affection in such a case. I do not believe that
					affection can exist without truth, without the ideal, and without blending with
					itself all that is best and most earnest in our nature. Charles thinks far less
					of Alice than of the sneer of Buckingham and the jest of Rochester.</p>
            <p>As I said before, a series of pictures might be formed of Alice in the various
					situations of "<title>Woodstock</title>." There are three which have
					always singularly impressed my imagination. The first is the little turret, with
					Dr. Rochecliffe in the little turret-chamber, when he proposes to her to make a
					seeming assignation with the King: there is the dignity that would light her
					eyes, the timidity that would colour her cheek, and the intuitive sense of right
					that could not for a moment tamper with its fine sense of maidenly propriety.
					Then the second, where she stands in the green coppice looking, as she thinks,
					her last on the lover who leaves her under the most bitter perversion of her
					real meaning: her cheek is white as monumental marble, and her long fair curls
					damp with the heavy dews—they are the faint outward sign of what is
					passing in her heart. The third is where, escaped from a danger which had seemed
					so certain and so imminent, she throws herself half in thankfulness, half in
					affection, into her father's arms, and then is suddenly recalled into a
					sweet and timid consciousness of Markham Everard's presence.</p>
            <p>None of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter</ref>'s novels end
					more satisfactorily than "<title>Woodstock</title>." There could be
					but one destiny for Alice—the genial and quiet circle of an English home,
					whose days are filled with pleasant duties, and whose sphere lies around the
					hearth. The devoted daughter is what she ought to be—the affectionate
					mother and the happy wife.</p>
