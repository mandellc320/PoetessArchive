				<p rendition="#noindent">I<hi rendition="#smcaps">t</hi> is the fashion to call the
					Italians fallen and degraded; and none are more acrimonious in their censures
					than the Anglo-Italians&#8212;a race which, while forgetting their patriotic
					duties in the delights of that paradisaics climate&#8212;while availing
					themselves of the benevolence and courtesy of the inhabitants&#8212;and while
					eating the fruits of that fertile land&#8212;without care or annoyance, repay
					the advantages they enjoy by abusing the natives. There is a gentleness, a
					facility, a kindliness in the Italians which spreads an atmosphere of repose
					around them. Their visitors feel and enjoy this; but, far from being grateful,
					they blind themselves to the virtues which benefit themselves, and fix their
					eyes on the faults which are injurious only to the Italians. They even go
					further, and often rail the louder, while they imitate more grossly the vices
					they denounce.</p>

				<p>Most of the defects of the Italians are those that always arise in a society
					debarred from active duties. An Italian has no career, and can find occupation
					only in intrigue and vice. The utter hopelessness that pervades their political
					atmosphere, the stagnation of every territorial or commercial enterprise, the
					discouragement cast over every improvement,&#8212;all these are checks to
					laudable ambition; and yet such is not entirely checked. How many Italian hearts
					beat high for their country. When any opening has presented itself, how many
					victims have rushed into the breach. Perhaps in the history of no people in the
					world has there appeared so tenacious a love of country and of liberty, nor so
					great a readiness shown to make every sacrifice to acquire independence, nor so
					confirmed and active an hatred for tyranny.</p>

				<p>After various struggles, and the destruction of their best citizens by the
					despot, still the Italians pant for freedom, and hope to attain it. The
					well-educated among them feel that their chief duty is, to counteract the
					pernicious effects of slavery and superstition in debasing the national
					character. To do this, several of the most eminent have turned authors, and
					risked property and safety for the holy task of disseminating principles and
					sentiments which, in their effect, will keep alive a sense of their rights in
					the minds of their countrymen, and render them worthy of the liberty they hope
					one day to see them enjoy.</p>

				<p>They are fortunate in one circumstance&#8212;the soil they would cultivate is
					rich and fertile. The thing that chiefly strikes any one conversant with the
					Italians, is their quick and clear understandings. In unfrequented parts of
					England, the people are stupid, and even savage. In France, they are still
					worse. They may practise the domestic virtues, but their minds are shrunk and
					shrivelled, or covered by so impenetrable an husk, that there are no means of
					having communication with them. The facilities of intercourse&#8212;for ever
					multiplying in this country&#8212;and the better education that subsists, has
					partly done away with this state of things; but in Italy, the peasant of its

					While the same divine bounty that has gifted him with a capacity to understand,
					has been also extended to his instructors; and the educated men of Italy are
					singularly able, laborious, <lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">e e 4</hi></fw><pb n="416"/>and enlightened. Italians are
					found to excel in every province of literature. The names of their poets rank
					among the highest: their novelists, either tragic or comic, are unsurpassed:
					their historians yield only to those of the ancient world. In science, in
					morals, in every species of inventive or disquisitive literature, we find
					Italians among the foremost in desert. No wonder their rulers fear such a
					people, and put in action all their efforts either to crush or turn aside from
					any, to them injurious, purpose, the labours of their men of genius and
					learning. Thus <ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Ugo Foscolo</ref> was
					banished; thus <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> was
					corrupted; the eloquent and admirable productions of the lover of liberty were
					proscribed; and not only were the writings of the slave impregnated with a base
					spirit, but his very subjects were dictated to him. To turn aside the thoughts
					of the men of letters from an elevated and useful aim, <ref
						target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> was commanded to raise that
					pitiful war of words which sprung from his
						&quot;<title>Proposta</title>.&quot;<note>A work making arguments about the reformation of national language, the
							first part of which was published in 1817.</note> The Austrian
					government well understood the Italian spirit, when it excited the Royal
					Institute of Milan to busy itself in the reform of the national dictionary, and
					imposed on <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> the task of
					overthrowing the authority of the &quot;Della Crusca,&quot;<note>The oldest linguistic academy in the world, based in
							Florence, Italy. Founded in 1583, the academy strove to maintain the
							purity of the Italian language.</note> and of asserting the
					propriety of adopting, as the classic language of Italy, a language not wholly
					Tuscan, but intermingled with modes of speech peculiar to other provinces. <ref
						target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> and his son-in-law, <ref
						target="people.html#PerticariGiulio">Perticari</ref>, began what they called
					a crusade against the &quot;Della Crusca.&quot; <ref
						target="people.html#PerticariGiulio">Perticari</ref>, young and virtuous,
					and led by <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref>, was probably
					innocent of any sinister motive. <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo"
						>Monti</ref> himself entered into the views of the Austrians: he knew his
					countrymen, and the unfortunate prejudices in Italy, which makes one portion the
					rival and enemy of another. The effect of his attack was electric. As if it had
					been the cause of independence, each literary man arose to defend the system of
					his country. The Tuscans thought their territory invaded, their dearest
					privileges undermined: the war continued for years. At present, many of the
					chief combatants are no more, while the few survivors may wonder at their folly
					at being thus entrapped to forget the nobler uses of their talents in so puerile
					a question; they may feel that had one among them written a book, in which
					genius and power had been clothed in elegant and forcible language, drawn either
					from the purest Tuscan source, or mingled with modes of speech deemed less
					classical, yet not less true to feeling, it had been a far better answer than
					volumes of verbal dispute. </p>

				<p>The Austrians, though they corrupted one of the greatest geniuses of Italy (<ref
						target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref>), and sent another (<ref
						target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Foscolo</ref>) to die in a foreign land, and
					were successful in causing all the talents of the country to be absorbed by a
					war of words, yet enjoyed only a temporary success. Deeper interests were
					awakened among the Italians during the outbreaks and struggles which marked the
					years 1820-21. Since then, their writers have been thoroughly awakened to the
					importance of their task in enlightening their countrymen, and in teaching them
					either lessons of Christian virtue, or animating them to a love of liberty. </p>

				<p>A very excellent article has appeared in the eleventh number of &quot;<title>The
						London and Westminster Review</title>,&quot; written, we believe, by a
					peculiarly clever and well-informed Italian resident in this country, named <ref

									1824-1900</title></hi> (vol. III, p. 590) as a collaborative
							piece with Angelo Usiglio, whose initials comprise the
						signature.</note> which throws great light on the moving springs of
					Italian literature. The author has, with great judgment, divided the writers of
					his country into two classes, both bent on ameliorating the character of their
					fellow countrymen, but by different means: the one aims at fostering the, so to
					speak, inoffensive virtues; the other, burning with a hatred of the oppressor,
					and with a thirst for the deliverance of their native land, endeavors to
					strengthen and elevate&#8212;to teach the Italians to become patriots and
					citizens&#8212;to inspire, <pb n="417"/>not resignation, but hope&#8212;not
					merely piety and benevolence, but ardour for the dissemination of the blessings
					of civilisation and freedom&#8212;not simply fortitude, but active courage,
					without which higher virtues, they are aware that Italy can never be delivered
					and renovated.</p>

				<p>Amidst the whole field of literature which <ref
						target="people.html#MazziniGiuseppe">Mazzini</ref> glances over, we select
					only one portion&#8212;its novels and romances.</p>

				<p>When a new sort of literature was, as it were, discovered, and men of the first
					talent in France and England occupied themselves by the composition of romances
					and novels&#8212;all sorts of fictitious adventure in prose, whether belonging
					to past ages or modern manners&#8212;it was to be supposed that the Italians
					would shine also in the same career. At first, however, they did not originate
					any work of the sort worthy of themselves, and it grew into a common opinion
					that the spirit of Italy was so crushed and deadened, that their writers had
					fallen into a low scale. <ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Ugo Foscolo</ref>
					was a mere imitator in his &quot;<title>Jacopo Ortis</title>.&quot; But <ref
						target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Foscolo</ref> was strictly a didactic
					writer. His refined and discerning mind, his eloquent and enthusiastic spirit,
					which dictated his labours on <ref target="people.html#PetrarcaFrancesco"
						>Petrarch</ref> and <ref target="people.html#Dante">Dante</ref>, and his
					poem of the &quot;<title>Sepolcri</title>&quot;&#8212;the most finished elegy of
					modern Italy, was not inventive of facts. &quot;<title>Jacopo
					Ortis</title>&quot; was a vehicle for opinions and emotions&#8212;not an epic,
					whose incidents and conduct were to interest and delight. </p>

				<p><ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> redeemed the reputation
					of his country. The &quot;<title>Promessi Sposi</title>,&quot; translated into
					every European language, is proof that the Italians are still themselves. It
					yields to no romance of any country in graphic descriptions&#8212;in
					eloquence&#8212;in touching incident and forcible reflection. It is, however, so
					entirely Italian in all its parts, that it can only be truly relished in its
					native guise. It has seized and individualised, as it were, various species of
					human beings, specimens of which can be found only in that soil; and thus, to a
					certain degree, its reputation must be local. Any one conversant with the
					Italian character perceives at once the truth and vividness of the picture; to
					others it is a fancy piece, and cannot come home in the same way to their
					experience and sympathies; besides that, the translation is vapid and lifeless,
					and incapable of communicating the spirit of the original. The excellence of
					this work consists, in the first place, in its admirable discrimination and
					representation of character. Its personages are not shadows and vague
					generalities, but men and women stamped with individuality. They all live and
					move before us&#8212;we feel as if we should recognise if we saw them&#8212;and
					those who have been in Italy have seen such, and perceive not portraits, but
					vivid resemblances. We have seen and recognise Don Abbondio, and his servant
					Perpetua; their modes of thinking and phraseology are all familiar to us, though
					graced in the work with the ideality which marks the perfection of art. The
					spirit and reality of such portions as may pass for episodes, the stories of
					Gertrude and Cristofero, are unsurpassed in any work, in any language, for
					interest, truth, and beauty. The conversion of the Innominato&#8212;the riots at
					Milan&#8212;the progress, prevalence, and cessation of the plague, are passages
					of high-wrought eloquence that carry the reader along with them. They show not
					only the deepest knowledge of the human heart, but a vivid graphic talent,
					surpassing that of every modern tale-writer. The defect of the work is its
					whole. Admirable in parts, it wants the artifice of plot, which should make the
					interest rise continually. From the moment that Lucia is liberated by the
					Innominato, the story, such as it is, comes to a stop. Much of this arises from
					the character of her betrothed. She herself, gentle, resigned, and affectionate,
					interests us more than that sort of person in a book usually does; but Renzo is
					not her fitting lover. It is <pb n="418"/>true that he is nature itself, the
					absolute portrait of an Italian rustic. We ought to be content that Lucia, a
					Milanese peasant, should have for a husband a person in the same situation of
					life; but the sweetness and blameless simplicity of the heroine removes her from
					the vulgarities of her situation, while Renzo is immersed in them; the
					discrepancy jars on our taste, and injures the tale as a work of art.</p>

				<p>The author of the &quot;<title>Promessi Sposi</title>&quot; has not aimed at
					inspiring ardour for liberty and hatred of the tyrant: his lessons are rather
					those of piety and resignation. In any other work we might blame this; but the
					truth is so much better than declamation, and the picture he gives of the evils
					of misrule and ignorance is so forcible, that it stands in lieu of didactic
					tirades. The effect of the book being to impress the reader with a deep sense of
					the mischiefs that ensue from a people being kept in a state of bigotry and
					ignorance, and from a foreign, inert, and short-sighted government, every
					un-prejudiced person must reap a well-founded hatred of tyrants and superstition
					from such worth a thousand diatribes.</p>

				<p>This want of a generous and enlarged aim is more to be deplored for the author
					than the work. <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> is a
					man of first-rate genius. Besides the &quot;<title>Promessi Sposi</title>,&quot;
					he has written two tragedies<note><hi rendition="#italics"><title>Il Conte di Carmagnola</title></hi>
							(1819) and <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Adelchi</title></hi>
							(1822).</note>&#8212; poems rather than dramas, composed according
					to the French notion of the Athenian theatre, but interspersed with choruses. As
					dramas, these plays are defective&#8212;as poems, they are highly beautiful.
					There is, in particular, a chorus in the &quot;<title>Camaledole</title>&quot;
					on the horrors of war and the blessings of peace, which may rank among the most
					beautiful lyrics in the Italian language. But the want of moral energy that
					blinds a Milanese to the real evils that afflict his country, superstition and
					despotism, has fallen heavily on the poet. <ref
						target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> has become a bigot and
					a slave. His life is spent in churches. His thoughts and actions are under the
					government of a priest, in obedience to whose dictates he has destroyed a
					beautiful romance on the subject of <ref target="people.html#Napoleon"
						>Napoleon.</ref> Thus that system of thought which teaches, &quot;Humble
					thyself, pray, be resigned to thy misfortunes; heaven is thy country, the things
					of this world are unworthy of thy attention, knowledge is vanity, and justice
					here below a dream<note>Article in
								&quot;<title>The London and Westminster Review</title>,&quot; No.
							XI. [<ref target="people.html#ShelleyMary">Shelley</ref>&apos;s
							note]</note>,&quot; has fallen with club-like weight on the head of
					this illustrious man, crushing his genius, rendering him ungrateful to his
					Creator for the surpassing gifts of mind lavished on him, causing him to
					&quot;hide his light under a bushel;&quot; so that, at the great account, when
					asked to what use he put the vast bounty of God, in giving him powers of soul
					superior to the multitude, he can only answer, &quot;I disdained your gift, and
					regarded the telling of my beads as the chief end and aim of an intelligent
					being’s life.&quot; Miserable, indeed, are the effects of catholicism, which
					causes the believer to surrender his conscience into the hands of another; which
					deprives man of his best privilege, that of judging by his innate sense of right
					and wrong; and utterly brutalises him, as he regulates his sense of duty by a
					fictitious code of morality, invented for the sole purpose of enslaving him,
					instead of resting it on the plain precepts of enlightened religion; which,
					while it teaches us to &quot;love our neighbour as ourself,&quot; will also
					teach that the best proof a man of genius can give of his obedience to this
					command, is to enlighten the ignorant, and animate to virtue the
					demoralised&#8212;a task that can in no way be so well fulfilled as by the
					multiplication of works that will convince the head of the excellence of right,
					and warm the heart with courage to exercise it. </p>

				<p>Next to <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref>, as a novelist,
					we may rank his son-in-law, <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo"
						>Azeglio</ref>, author of &quot;<title>Hector Fieramosca</title>.&quot; This
					work has enjoyed great reputation in <pb n="419"/>Italy, and, though far below
					the <title>Promessi Sposi</title> in genius, possesses considerable merit.</p>

				<p>&quot;The Duel of Barletta&quot; (La Sfida di Barletta)<note
							place="foot">The famouns 1503 duel, fought tournament style with the
							historical Ettore Fieramosca and 12 compatriot contenders opposing 13
							French, is depicted in <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo"
								>Azeglio</ref>&apos;s novel <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Ettore
									Fieramosca</title></hi>. </note> is naturally a favourite
					topic with the Italians. Being so often stigmatised as cowards, they turn with
					pride to this glorious achievement. Its origin is briefly as
					follows:&#8212;Naples had been reigned over by a branch of the house of Aragon
					for the space of sixty-five years, when <ref target="people.html#CharlesVIII"
						>Charles VIII.</ref>, King of France, was stimulated by the treachery and
					ambition of a prince of Milan to bring forward the claim of the house of Anjou.
					He (and then first those disastrous wars began, when the French met the Spaniard
					on the fields of Italy) entered the Peninsula, and overran and possessed himself
					of Naples: but, on his return to his native kingdom, he lost his conquest as
					speedily as he had gained it. On his death, which soon after followed, his
					successor, <ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis XII.</ref>, prosecuted the
					same claim to the Neapolitan crown. <ref target="people.html#FrederickIV"
						>Frederic</ref>, king of Naples, turned for assistance to his relative, <ref
						target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref> of Spain, who, making
					the fairest promises, acted with the utmost treachery. He and <ref
						target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> agreed to dispossess the reigning
					sovereign, and to divide the kingdom between them. <ref
						target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> was to possess the Abruzzi and the
					Terra di Lavoro; <ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref>,
					Calabria and Puglia. The Pope ratified this compact. For a time, however, it was
					kept secret. <ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> invaded Naples, but
						<ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref> promised his
					kinsman succour, and sent, apparently for that purpose, him whom the Spaniards
					name the &quot;great captain,&quot; &#8212; <ref
						target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo de Cordova</ref>. The
					catastrophe was soon brought about: the French overran the northern portion of
					the kingdom of Naples; Capua was besieged, and taken by treason; and <ref
						target="people.html#FrederickIV">Frederic</ref>, while he hoped to find
					assistance in the Spaniards, was informed of the treachery of <ref
						target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref>. Dispossessed of his
					kingdom, he first retired to Ischia, and afterwards took refuge in France. The
					French and Spaniards, after some resistance on the part of the eldest son of
						<ref target="people.html#FrederickIV">Frederic</ref>, possessed themselves
					of the land: peace, however, was not the result. The division they had agreed
					upon was not made so carefully but that room was left to dispute the boundaries.
					At first, the rival pretensions were amicably arranged in a meeting of <ref
						target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Louis d&apos;Armagnac</ref>, Duc de
					N&#233;mours, the French viceroy, with <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo"
						>Gonzalvo de Cordova</ref>: but this was of short duration, and war speedily
					broke out. The Spanish party was weak and unprovided, and <ref
						target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo</ref>, to gain time, fortified
					himself at Barletta, there to await the arrival of succour from Spain, and to
					wear out the French by a war of outposts. The Neapolitans themselves were
					divided; the Aragonese party adhering to Spain; the partisans of the house of
					Anjou, to France: the former, however, considered themselves as the real
					patriotic party, and treated their antagonists as traitors.</p>

				<p>The<ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis"> Duc de N&#233;mours</ref> blockaded
					Barletta: both generals avoided attacks and general engagements, while the
					numerous chivalry on both sides satisfied their martial tastes and thirst for
					honour by various challenges and duels. <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo"
						>Gonzalvo</ref> reaped every advantage from this species of warfare, and in
					the delay that ensued. The <ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Duc de
						N&#233;mours</ref> endeavoured to draw his antagonist into battle, and
					failed; but, while despising an enemy who refused to fight, he marched with the
					utmost carelessness. The Spaniards fell on his troops, and made a great many
					prisoners.</p>

				<p>Among these was Charles Hennuyer de la Motte, a French officer of distinguished
					bravery. He and his friends in misfortune were invited to partake of a feast
					given by <ref target="people.html#MendozaDiego">Mendoza</ref>, his conqueror.
					During the conversation that took place on this occasion, <ref
						target="people.html#MendozaDiego">Mendoza</ref> attributed his victory to
					the admirable mon&#339;uvring of the Italian cavalry, commanded by <ref
						target="people.html#ColonnaProspero">Prospero Colonna</ref>. The French
					despised the Italians; and La Motte exclaimed that, vanquished as they were on
					all occasions, they could not presume to compare <pb n="420"/>with the French in
					any species of warfare, and were only worthy to hold the stirrup to the knights
					of France. The good humour of the festival was not interrupted by this insult,
					but, on the morrow, <ref target="people.html#ColonnaProspero">Prospero
						Colonna</ref> called on La Motte to retract his words: he refused. The
					honour of both nations appeared to be engaged; and the generals on either side
					permitted the question to be decided by an appeal to arms. Thirteen Italians and
					thirteen Frenchman, completely armed, agreed to meet in the lists to fight till
					they fell, or were made prisoners. The lists were selected midway between
					Barletta and the quarters of the <ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Duc de
						N&#233;mours</ref>. They were surrounded only by a furrow made by a
					ploughshare; but it was settled that, whoever among the combatants could be
					driven beyond this boundary, must surrender as vanquished. The Italians were
					victorious. The French having in their presumption neglected to bring with them
					the hundred apiece, agreed on as ransom, were led prisoners to Barletta.</p>

				<p>Such is the history of the celebrated challenge which <ref
						target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> has made the ornament of
					his tale. This work has already been translated&#8212;badly enough; but the mere
					English reader has probably gathered the gist of the story from the translation,
					as well as from any skeleton account that we can give. The first thing that
					strikes the Italian reader, on commencing the perusal, is the purity and elegant
					simplicity of the style. This merit is lost in the translation. It is more
					difficult, perhaps, to translate well from the Italian than any other language;
					for the peculiarity of its prose is a wordiness unendurable in any other; and it
					requires a thorough knowledge of the genius of the language, as well as
					considerable practice in authorship, at once to preserve the peculiar style of
					the author, and to produce a readable book. </p>

				<p>The beauty of <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>&apos;s
					writing is very great: it is forcible, without exaggeration; elegant, without
					effort; and in this is very well adapted to the characteristic of his work,
					which derives its merit from its story, rather than from masterly delineation of
					character. It is not that the plot is perfect, especially according to our
					ideas; but it is congruous in its parts, and deeply interesting as a whole. The
					ill-fated pair of lovers are presented to us in situations full of pathos: the
					delicacy of sentiment and heroism which they display redeems their position from
					its usual difficulties. A wife, disliking her husband, and loving another man,
					is a subject, the topics of which are so obvious, that it is rather a favourite
					with modern novel-writers; yet it is always infinitely displeasing. <ref
						target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> has managed it far better
					than any other: the passionate, yet regulated, love of the gentle Ginevra, which
					she broods over in her island convent; the deep, religious devotion of
					Fieramosca to her and to virtue; the dark terrors that surround them, as well as
					the chivalric glory that adorns and gilds both themselves and all that surrounds
					them, sheds grace over every page; and, though these characters are rather
					shadowed forth than strongly marked, and others are but sketched, yet the few
					lines we perceive are masterly, and so much in keeping, that though the whole
					picture is, so to speak, presented in a subdued light, there is no obscurity,
					nor confusion, nor distortion. The only fault we find is in the personage <ref
						target="people.html#BorgiaCesare">C&#230;sar Borgia</ref>. He acts at once
					too subordinate and too influential a part. Kept for the most part in the
					background, he yet is the most important actor on the scene:&#8212;nor does his
					conduct seem natural: he, the most restless and fiery of men, is described as
					being content to remain secreted for many days in a secret chamber of his
					enemy&apos;s fortress, for no sufficing reason, and then, unexpectedly, the most
					disgusting and heinous crime is thrown in his path, which he commits, and then
					disappears. We may be hypercritical: it would be unnatural to place a romance in
					that age, and <pb n="421"/>people it with such personages, and not introduce
					crime in the foreground. But a romance-writer must never rest the justification
					of his plot on bare truth, without adding the dress of art. In real life, our
					acts and impulses are often most motiveless, in our own eyes, when once past;
					but in fiction we ought always to feel the enchainment of events as inevitable.
						<ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> wished to paint his
					heroine the greatest virtue triumphing over the greatest misfortune: for this he
					makes her die deceived as to her lover, and believing him inconstant. We feel
					the heroism of her character, but recoil from the trial to which it is put, and
					we would fain that Donna Elvira, herself undeceived, had undeceived Ginevra, and
					that her last moment had been gladdened by the consciousness of
					Fieramosca&apos;s truth, which, if she had already forgiven her rival, would not
					have detracted from the height of her virtue. We scarcely know any passage in
					any author impregnated with a more pathetic spirit than the conclusion of the
					novel. The night that Fieramosca passes preceding the great duel; his endeavours
					to believe that all is well with Ginevra; and the unquiet emotions inspired by
					the scarce audible psalmody over the dead, and by the beams of the light which,
					in truth, was placed beside the corpse of her he loved, whom he thought living;
					are touched with a truth and delicacy that go to the heart. The lighter parts of
					the work are also admirable: the bull-fight&#8212;the feast&#8212;the characters
					of Fanfulla, Paredes, &amp;c., are entertaining and sprightly; and the
					description of the great duel itself is brilliant and spirited. There is both
					pathos and humour in different portions of the tale, but there is no wit. The
					Italians are not a witty people, nor does their language lend itself to wit: the
					peculiarity before mentioned, its wordiness, is against a quality whose
					characteristic is brevity and terseness. <ref
						target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> is highly humorous in
						<title>Don Abbondio</title>, but he is never witty; and the same with <ref
						target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>; the same with every other
					Italian prose writer; the same will be found in their conversation. In this, as
					in almost every other quality of mind, they are in contrast with the French.</p>

				<p>The challenge of the Barletta is so dear to the Italians, that it has been
					selected to adorn the pages of another novel of great merit. &quot;<title>The
						first Viceroy of Naples</title>&quot; (<title>Il Primo Vicere di
						Napoli</title>) deserves honourable mention in this account of Italian
					romances. It is the work of <ref target="people.html#CapocciErnesto"
						>Capocci</ref>, a Neapolitan, a celebrated astronomer, and a man of profound
					learning. Deeming that the acknowledgement of so light a production might injure
					his reputation as a man of science, he has put the name of Belmonte, which was
					that of his mother, in the titlepage; and, with that pride in honouring those
					they love, which belongs to the Italians, he has dedicated it to his wife, a
					lady of great merit and talents.</p>

				<p>The warriors of Barletta are the heroes of this tale. Fieramosca and Brancaleone
					are introduced as principal personages; and one of the first incidents is the
					meeting of the latter with his friend&apos;s sister, and their mutual and sudden
					attachment. But the spirit of the romance is in absolute contrast with <ref
						target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>&apos;s.
						&quot;<title>Hector Fieramosca</title>&quot; is a tale of living, struggling
					humanity: it describes individuals suffering misfortune and deep sorrow,
					occasioned by such events as grow out of the situation of their country, and the
					characters of their contemporaries. It is almost too real for fiction in its
					disappointments, long-enduring griefs, and tragic catastrophe; while
						&quot;<title>The First Viceroy of Naples</title>&quot; is, as far as plot is
					concerned, the commonplace loves of a boy and girl, whose attachment, after a
					series of adventures and disasters, ends in a happy marriage. One of the chief
					merits of this book is its simplicity, both of style and sentiment. Wearied by
					the tendency to bombast now prevailing in literature, the reader is charmed by
					the <pb n="422"/>ease of the language, and becomes interested unawares in the
					tissue of incidents, artlessly but agreeably combined. The tale begins with the
					siege of Capua, mentioned in the sketch given above of the progress of these
					wars; and here an episode is introduced, which is a good specimen of the manner
					and power of the author, though, from its length, it must be somewhat
					abridged.</p>

				<p>Antonello Caracciolo, the head of one of the noblest families of Naples, was a
					youth of great promise; he was courteous and gentle; and this in spite of the
					evil lessons of a natural brother, Raymond, who stimulated him to acts of folly
					and vice: his only faults were such as belonged to his few years. He became
					enamoured of a peasant girl, the daughter of one of his Calabrian vassals. This
					girl had a brother, Rocco, a man of giant force and vehement passions, a
					ruffian&#8212;who was only not a bandit, because he still loved his parents and
					his sister. Raymond perceived his brother&apos;s attachment to Constance, and
					conceived a plan of villany to get her into his power. A man had been
					assassinated near her dwelling; her brother was at a distance. Raymond accused
					her father of the murder, and threw him into prison; and then instigated her
					mother to go, accompanied by Constance, and throw herself at Antonello&apos;s
					feet. The conclusion may be guessed: the daughter was led away, the mother
					roughly dismissed, but with the intimation that her request was granted. The
					father was liberated, and returned; but, when he found that the ransom paid was
					his daughter&apos;s honour, he broke out into the fiercest imprecations; and his
					son suddenly at this moment returning, he threatened to curse him unless he
					washed out the stain on the family by some act of dire revenge. Rocco, foiled in
					his attempt to see Raymond, is driven by insult to assassinate several of
					Antonello&apos;s followers, and flies to the mountains. That same night terrible
					signs of his fury were visible in the vast possessions of the prince, and
					dreadful fires marked the fatal rise of the most famous bandit of an age in
					which so many flourished.</p>

				<p>The father appealed for vengeance for his wrongs to his sovereign. Antonello had
					taken refuge in Naples with his peasant mistress, to whom he had become
					passionately attached. An order was issued that the family of Caracciolo should
					deliver him up to justice; and when this command was disobeyed, a party of
					masons were sent to raze the houses of the family, with an order to level one
					after the other to the ground, till Antonello should be found. On this the
					unfortunate youth was delivered up, and condemned to death. The tale
					continues:&#8212;</p>
				<quote><p>Then a marriage was mentioned, which at first gave rise to rejoicing; but,
						when the family began no longer to fear for the life of their relative, they
						declared that death was to be preferred to such a disgrace. Nor was there a
						noble to whom it did not appear excessive injustice to proceed as severely
						as if the two parties had been of equal rank. It seemed strange to them to
						give the same attention to the complaints of an injured vassal, as if he
						were a count or a baron. But every father and every brother, born out of the
						privileged class, exulted in his heart, as the chimera, which had a hundred
						times risen in his mind, of impartial justice in such cases, appeared on the
						point of being realised.</p>
					<p>One morning the inhabitants of the market-place saw a black scaffold elevated
						in the middle of the square; and immediately a vast crowd assembled, more
						than usually eager to witness so important an execution. The spacious
						circuit was soon filled, and soon the press grew so great, that the people,
						jammed together, appeared to lose all elasticity, and to be fused into one
						mass. There were people on the belfreys, at the windows in the balconies:
						they covered the tops of the houses, the sides of the fountains, the <pb
							n="423"/>cornices of the shops and palaces. The unfortunate Antonello,
						taken from his dungeon, was led in a cart through one of those narrow alleys
						of the old city of Naples, in which there were none but the cart and the
						guard that escorted it. When this party turned into the market-place, the
						vast crowd, with one voice, uttered a loud involuntary shout. The hapless
						youth, dismayed by the spectacle, almost lost his senses. The terrible truth
						presented to his sight was hidden by a delirium not less terrible. A mist is
						before his eyes&#8212;a ringing in his ears&#8212;a cold moisture pervades
						his body&#8212;his heart palpitates to bursting&#8212;trembling and
						tottering, every thing turns round&#8212;all seems giving way, and falling
						into an abyss. The vehement curiosity of the multitude at first sight of
						Caracciolo immediately changed to pity. Each uncovered his head at the sign
						of salvation that headed the sad procession, and all remained still and
						silent. It was a solemn spectacle, when each of so many thousands of men was
						so preoccupied, that you might have fancied yourself in a desert. At the
						sudden change the delirium of Antonello also changed: it appeared to him as
						if the pavement of the immense square had been taken up, and that, instead
						of stones, it was laid down with human heads, and that he and the
						executioner were alone in the empty space, while the latter stretched out
						his hand to seize his hair. O horror! his head is about to fall among the
						rest! He wished to shriek&#8212;to stop&#8212;to fly! but an irresistible
						force&#8212;the power of fate&#8212;prevents his moving, and carries him on
						towards the scaffold. The cart proceeded amidst the press, which, deaf to
						the signs of the attendants, opened with difficulty to the curvets and leaps
						of the horses of the armed men, and then closing behind, as the waves of the
						sea after a vessel, while it seemed to the unfortunate man that at these
						moments the earth was opening to swallow him. Those who were near saw
						clearly the internal struggles caused by these visions in the contortion of
						his limbs and convulsion of his features, but the violence of the agony
						prevented its long continuance, and he fell fainting in the arms of the
						priest. When they arrived at the foot of the scaffold, he came to himself,
						and sighed, and exclaimed, in a voice of woe, &quot;My God! where am I? am I
						alive? where is Constance? where my mother?&quot; Then, opening his eyes, he
						looked fixedly round, till, shuddering and turning away, he cried, &quot;No,
						no!&#8212;he is still there&#8212;No&#8212;I am not yet dead!&quot; Now the
						comforting voice of the holy minister came to his aid, and the unexpected
						sight of his Constance, who had arrived by another way, entirely restored
						his courage. Forgetting the chains that held him back, he was about to
						advance and embrace her. Hope returned, and he thought, &quot;It cannot be
						true&#8212;the duchess does not hate me&#8212;how have I injured her? she
						has always been kind to me&#8212;I cannot forget it: at the last festival at
						Poggio Reale the duchess and the king were peculiarly courteous: it is a
						mere show, no more. What wild beast, what tiger, would be so cruel? and to
						one of my rank&#8212;and at my age! No, it is impossible&#8212;it is folly
						to imagine otherwise! Constance is all my regret; the hapless Constance,
						made by me the fable of her native place, and now of the whole kingdom.
						Unhappy girl&#8212;I suffer, and deserve it; but you, innocent creature,
						you, indeed, will become the wife of Antonello Caracciolo yet; so that it
						will seem that I am forced to marry her, while, in truth, there is nothing
						in the world I desire more&#8212;nothing&#8212;not even life!&quot; And
						these same thoughts passed through the minds of the spectators.</p>
					<p>They ascend the scaffold. The feebleness of the youth need not excite
						surprise&#8212;who ascends between two white-clad monks, and seems bowed by
						age. See you not how each step adds years to his age? That ill-omened throng
						of priests and monks freeze the blood, and the extreme youth of <pb n="424"
						/>the condemned man inspires deep pity. But the sight of the girl, who was
						the innocent cause of the punishment, excited a more tender emotion, and
						softened the hardest heart. The peril of Antonello, whom she already
						regarded as a beloved husband, was an insupportable torment to her. Now,
						pale and ghastly, she had fallen if she had not been supported&#8212;now,
						changing colour and blushing, she trembled and shuddered, and was convulsed
						as by the most acute pain. Sometimes she raised her eyes to heaven,
						sometimes she turned them fearfully round to find a spot where she could
						look without meeting the gaze of others&#8212;sometimes she covered her face
						with her hands, as she appeared to invoke death or the termination of her
						agony.</p>
					<p>An altar and a block were both placed on the scaffold. When the two young
						beings drew near to celebrate the enforced nuptials, they rushed into each
						other&apos;s arms, and held each other in a long embrace. They were forcibly
						separated, that the rite might be fulfilled; Constance was dowered by the
						prince according to his rank: she received the bridal ring, and the priest
						blessed them. The crowd who witnessed this moving ceremony could not
						restrain from tears&#8212;the very agents wept; and who would not? But all
						did not finish here. The same priest who had pronounced the sacred words
						which gave rise to a new source of life, the very same chaunted forth the
						comforting psalms that were used to precede the death of the condemned, and
						to announce the violent separation of a being, guilty though he were, yet
						our fellow-creature, from the rest of the world. What a tremendous moment!
						New sprung hope had pitilessly deceived the unfortunate Antonello. Hope had
						given him strength to feel the spasms of agony till the last moment, as is
						made manifest by the accent in which he repeats the prayers. And yet he
						doubts; he does not abandon hope; but, alas! the executioner seizes him, and
						forces him to kneel beside the block.</p>
					<p>Already the axe is raised, when a murmur, none knows whence originating, and
						then a clamour, is heard among the crowd, crying, Pardon! pardon! And can it
						be? A horseman endeavours to make his way towards the scaffold. Room is
						eagerly made. Does he not bring a pardon? Profound silence returns. None can
						take their eyes from him, yet all desire to gaze on Antonello, and they are
						eager to see both at once. The officer being arrived opposite, made a sign
						to those on the scaffold; and in a moment, the severed head of Caracciolo
						was seen shaking, hanging by the hair, as it was held up by the
						blood-stained hand of the executioner. The eyes were seen to roll, and words
						and blood to flow from the lips. At the same moment, a piercing shriek was
						heard, as it were the concentrated expression of general horror; and the
						woman who gave forth that shriek fell on the ground.</p>
					<p>A gloomy murmur arose from the sea of heads. It moved and opened in a hundred
						parts, and the whole crowd, horrified and frightened, separated at once. The
						ill-fated Constance never rose more. Whether it were surprise, or shame, at
						finding herself the object of so many eyes at an ignominious
						spectacle&#8212;whether compassion for her lover, or whether poison had been
						given her, as was reported, by his relations&#8212;she died.</p>
					<p>The marble effigy of these unhappy lovers, placed above the arch of the
						steeple of St. Eligio, in the midst of the market-place, reminds the
						passer-by of their miserable fate.</p></quote>

				<p>The account given in this work of the duel itself is peculiarly striking. The
					unaffected simplicity of the style rises into dignity when supported by the
					importance of the subject. It is, in some respects, superior to <ref
						target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>&apos;s, especially in the
					interest it excites. The duel in &quot;<title>Hector Fieramosca</title>&quot; is
					placed at the end of the work. The reader has been deeply affected by the <pb
						n="425"/>wrongs and death of Ginevra: the duel serves neither to avenge her,
					nor to advance any portion of the story; and loses its natural interest from its
					taking place when that of the story to which it is appended has drawn to the
					close. In <ref target="people.html#CapocciErnesto">Belmonte</ref>&apos;s romance
					it takes place early in the tale, and the personages are full of ardour, hope,
					and enjoyment. We extract a portion, as a further specimen of the merits of this
					work; a good translation of which we should be glad to see among our English
					romances.</p>

				<quote><p>The Italian combatants had heard mass, and sworn to die rather than
						survive a defeat, and to defend each other till death. They then set forward
						to the appointed place. Half way they met their four judges, who told them
						that they had conferred with the judges of the adverse party, and fixed the
						conditions of the fight; but that the French had not yet arrived. However,
						Hector Fieramosca, believing the hour agreed upon to be not far off, thought
						it right not to delay: and, advancing slowly for the space of another mile,
						arrived at the field. It was a lonely spot, half way between Quarata and
						Andria, where even now may be seen the fragments of the monument which was
						erected there in memory of that glorious day, excellently adapted by nature
						for the purpose; for the soil around is wavy with various irregularities;
						but here it becomes completely even and plain, and, for a sufficient space,
						spreads itself into the form of an amphitheatre, unencumbered by any
						hinderance of tree or rock, while an olive wood flourishes around, forming,
						as it were, a thick garland. The little plain, being rather low, was
						covered, through the effects of rain, by a fine shingle, and offered a
						perfect arena for the man&#339;uvres of the horsemen. On this occasion, the
						lists selected in the midst of this plain were surrounded by a furrow that
						enclosed about the eighth part of a mile, and was marked at intervals by
						large stones. Due egress was given between these to the combatants, who,
						defeated in the combat, were forced to surrender as vanquished. A seat was
						prepared for the judges at one extremity of the field, on a jutting ridge of
						earth, and a magnificent scarlet canopy was raised under the olives. Before
						and around, but lower down, stood the trumpeters and heralds, who attended
						on the joust.</p>
					<p>When the Italians arrived, they were struck by the singular aspect of the
						field. There was no crowd pressing to and fro without the lists&#8212;no
						waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs&#8212;no impatient nor welcoming cries at
						the appearance of the combatants&#8212;all was lonely and quiet. But this
						gave a more solemn aspect to the scene, as this solitude did not arise from
						any want of spectators, but from urgent necessity, and, so to speak, a holy
						reverence: for afar off, in the neighbourhood of Andria and Corato, were to
						be seen many companies of horsemen, who had no other object than to wait on
						the necessities of the combat; and, scattered abroad through the country on
						the limits of the field, innumerable groups of spectators were to be seen
						clustered upon straw-ricks and trees, who, in a moment, could have walled in
						the circuit of the lists, had they been allowed to approach.</p>
					<p>The Italians dismounted, and, kneeling down, implored the protection of the
						God of Armies; and then, while waiting for the arrival of the enemy, Hector
						addressed his party thus:&#8212;&quot;Brothers and companions, I should be
						devoid of understanding, did I think, by my words, to inspire with courage
						warriors chosen by our illustrious leader as the flower of his troop. No, my
						friends, we know each other well. But, since the enemy have not yet made
						their appearance, I have thought it right in this interval to open my mind,
						which augurs undoubted victory. In times past, many have fought for the sake
						of private enmity&#8212;others to acquire wealth or power&#8212;others for
						the love of ladies. But you combat for honour and glory, the <lb/><fw type="vol"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. ii.</hi></fw><fw
							type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">f f</hi></fw><pb n="426"
						/>most precious and noblest reward that fortune can offer to the brave. And
						you must also reflect, that you fight to-day, not only for your own glory,
						but for that of the whole Italian nation. May this inspire you, and gift you
						with immortal renown, making you famous examples of patriotic valour, and
						the enduring theme of noble recollection to posterity. Yes, my friends, this
						combat will be regarded with infinite anxiety by the army, by Italy, by the
						whole world; and the names of the valiant men who shall remain conquerers on
						the field will go down to the remotest posterity. I will not allude to the
						enemy&apos;s arrogance and injurious contempt. May Heaven avert that any of
						us survive to see the seal put to our shame. What more famous pass of arms
						than this can our descendants ever witness? In every other it is a mere game
						and display: this will be a fierce battle. In others, the nature of the
						arms, and the rules by which they are to be used, is established&#8212;in
						this we choose for ourselves as in war itself. In a tournament the point of
						the lance is blunt&#8212;the swords have no edge&#8212;it is dishonourable
						to wound a horse&#8212;it is a felony to strike with the point. Here we
						wield lances, clubs, swords, and daggers; and happy is he who can plunge the
						blade into the heart of his adversary. Yes, happy is he who can reach the
						heart of him who desires to dishonour his bride, his sister, and his mother;
						for such is he who dares to vituperate our country, and cover it with
						infamy. Wherefore, war and death to the French! with every weapon, war and
						death!&quot; At this moment he perceived some on the opposite side appear:
						he became silent, and, ordering his helmet to be laced, they mounted their
						horses, placed their lances in the rests, and began to canter lightly, and
						to caricole about the field, that they might become familiar with it.</p>
					<p>The French now presented themselves. First came a gentleman carrying the
						helmet and lance of Monseigneur de la Motte; twelve other gentlemen
						followed, two by two, who in like manner carried the lances and helmets of
						their friends. Then, at fitting intervals, the six couples of combatants
						followed, armed and mounted as the Italians were; then came La Motte alone;
						behind him came his spotted charger, and, lastly, the twelve chargers, led
						by twelve gentlemen, two by two.</p>
					<p>La Motte, seeing that the Italian cavaliers were prepared, alighted from his
						hack, and caused his comrades to dismount also. Custom demanded that the
						leader, on such an occasion, should make a short harangue; but the eager La
						Motte, excited by the sight of the enemy, and naturally adverse to all
						formality, burst forth at once. &quot;There they are, my friends, only
						thirteen&#8212;thirteen exactly, as we are! Shall we allow ourselves to be
						vanquished at equal arms&#8212;we, who have always seen a double and a
						triple number fly before us? By my faith! this is the first time we have met
						so exactly; and the best is that they are all alike, and there is not one
						Spaniard among them. Poor wretches! not another word about them; there they
						are&#8212;you behold them so light and airy&#8212;in a little while not one
						will be seen on the field. Come, let us teach them how arrogant they are to
						compete with the cavaliers of the King of France. But, I implore you, spare
						that youth on the bay, with a blue and white scarf: it belongs to me to
						attack that <hi rendition="#italics">millantatore</hi><note>Braggart; loudmouth.</note> Fieramosca; but
						afterwards I have a particular engagement with that boy&#8212;reserve him
						for me&#8212;he challenged me, <hi rendition="#italics">morbleu!</hi><note>An expression of surprise, emphasis,
								or exasperation.</note>&#8212;so have a care of him.&quot;</p>
					<p>They then knelt, and addressed a prayer to Heaven, armed themselves, and,
						being in the saddle, began also with infinite delight to scour the field;
						and then the standards were placed at each extremity of the field, in
						expectation of the moment when the judges should give the signal for
						battle.</p></quote>

				<p>The combat itself is described with great vivacity, and in particular the <pb
						n="427"/>encounter of La Motte and Brancaleone. Brancaleone is the hero of
					the tale, but he is a mere youth; and the author, while he wished to attribute
					to him the honour of vanquishing the French leader, felt that it was too much to
					make him fall by his hand. But he extricates himself from this difficulty
					admirably. They had already met and fought, and been separated in the
					m&#234;l&#233;e, and now they met again. &quot;The dauntless La Motte had begun
					to lose faith in his unvanquishable prowess; since in this species of skirmish
					his giant stature and immense strength were of less avail than the agility of
					the youth, whom with presumptuous confidence he had despised. He writhed, and
					foamed, and became confused through rage; his desire to conquer became a balk;
					and the more blindly he rushed on to wound his adversary, the more he exposed
					himself to his blows. So much blood flowed from his body, and he was wounded in
					so many places, that he no longer feared injury, since, could he strike to earth
					his daring adversary, he had been content to be killed by a thousand wounds. At
					length, among the innumerable blows dealt by La Motte, one reached its aim, and
					poor Brancaleone also poured out a river of blood; and, on recovering from the
					stroke, he staggered so that his enemy thought it all over with him. Then his
					boldness returned; believing that his victory was secure, he turned his eyes to
					the other combatants, to gather the triumph of the entire conflict. And, though
					his companions strewed the field, yet, as he saw some among them still on
					horseback, fighting valiantly, he believed that, could he lend his aid, they
					would conquer. He therefore changed his mode of attack, and became cautious, and
					as avaricious of his blood as before he had been lavish. On the other side,
					Brancaleone, who believed that the blood he spilt must inevitably occasion his
					death, gave, as a light that expires, the last flame, and threw himself on La
					Motte with inexpressible fury; while he, warding off the blows, continued to
					back, and waited to take advantage of some good opportunity, afforded by the
					other’s fury, to end the great struggle by a blow with his club. But, at this
					crisis, he heard the cry around&#8212;&apos;La Motte, prisoner! Prisoner, La
					Motte!&apos; Both paused: La Motte looked around&#8212;he perceived that he had
					passed the furrow, and was without the lists! A heavy groan burst from him, and
					he fell with extended arms, as if struck by a thunderbolt.&quot;</p>

				<p>The story of this work turns on the loves of Brancaleone and Giacinta, the sister
					of Fieramosca; the brother being at first friendly, and then adverse, to their
					marriage. The prince of Caracciolo, drawn on by the instigations of his bastard
					brother, Raymond, seeks her hand; and Hector is desirous of this alliance. The
					prince is assassinated under circumstances that cause poor Brancaleone to be
					more than suspected. He is thrown into prison, and condemned; he escapes, and
					flies to the mountains, Giacinta being the companion of his flight. The most
					pleasing passages of the work are those that describe the wanderings of the
					lovers, and their residence at the rude but hospitable village of Picinisco. The
					interest is never high-drawn, but the purity of the style, and the artless
					simplicity of the narrative, spread a grace over the pages, very unlike the
					inflated and exaggerated sentiment now the fashion in French romances. The
					village life at Picinisco is a picture full of innocence and repose. It is
					disturbed by the inroads of some notorious banditti, the leader of whom is Rocco
					del Pizzo, brother of the unfortunate Constance, who, under the name of
					Gambalunga, spreads terror around; and who declared, in scoff of the guard of
					hunters among Picinisco, that, when they least expected it, he would appear
					alone among them, and carry off the prettiest girl in the village. His success
					in this enterprise is amusingly told:&#8212;</p>
				<quote><p>On the days of festival the devout inhabitants descended to the old church
						of Santa Maria, placed at the foot of the moun-<lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">f f 2</hi></fw><pb n="428"/>tain,
						on the top of which, at the distance of a long musket-shot, stands
						Picinisco. It was the last Sunday of the month, and the children of Ser
						Ilario had betaken themselves betimes to the church, that they might be
						among the first to occupy the sides of the confessional of the Canon Crolla,
						who was the confessor in vogue among these good girls. When they reached the
						sacristy, they saw, leaning against the great stone eagle which may still be
						seen near the great gate of the church, a strong youth, who, from his blue
						cloak, his black nose, and the marks of heat in his face, seemed to be a
						courier from San Donato. When he saw them approach, he met them with the
						usual salutation, <hi rendition="#italics">Gesu e Maria</hi>, and, holding
						out a letter, said, &quot;Thank God! that at last I found some one who can
						read this paper. My master bade me be speedy; and I have been waiting half
						an hour here, and cannot find a soul who can read. I know it is for a
						certain Giannantonio, but I cannot remember his surname.&quot;</p>
					<p>Celestina took the letter in her hand, saying to herself, as she tried to
						decipher the writing, &quot;How stupid the people of San Donato are! they
						make a long journey, and do not know to whom they are going. This fellow
						does not look silly; and yet he fancies some one can read among these
						villages! Were it not for the signora, I had never learnt so much.&quot;</p>
					<p>Her sisters proceeded to the confessional; and she read
						&quot;Gian&#8212;antonio&#8212;Ar&#8212;,&quot; &quot;Arcaro&#8212;Arcaro.
						Now I recollect,&quot; said the messenger. &quot;Well,&quot; said the girl,
						&quot;Giannantonio Arcaro, my friend, does not live at Picinisco, but at Aia
						del Lupo.&quot; &quot;And where is Aia del Lupo?&quot;
						&quot;Look&#8212;there are houses&#8212;behind the hill.&quot; &#8212;
							&quot;<hi rendition="#italics">Cospetto!</hi><note>An exclamation of surprise or wonder.</note> I
						thought myself arrived, and I am two miles off. How shall I get back to San
						Donato before dinner? What shall I do? my master bade me hurry. My good
						girl, be charitable, show me the shortest way.&quot; &quot;That before you,
						take that road&#8212;when you get to the fountain, turn to the left, and
						take the path&#8212;but it would be easier to show you the way than to make
						you understand it;&quot; and, doing what she said, followed by the youth,
						she reached the fountain, and pointed out the lane of a cross-way which he
						was to take. But at this moment his eyes lighted up with a fierce
						expression, which made her eager to return; so she said, &quot;Now I have
						shown you the way, good bye, friend.&quot; &quot;No, my dear, I do not
						understand; be so good as to go with me as far as the lane.&quot;
						&quot;Really&#8212;and what do you take me for, good man! I have lost time
						coming so far: go, in God&apos;s name! for I must hasten to church.&quot;
						&quot;You are right, my pretty angel, but you must sometimes do a good turn
						by a neighbour. I am in a greater hurry, perhaps, than you, my
						dear&#8212;Come&#8212;come as far as that. With so pretty a face, you must
						not be hard-hearted. I only ask you to go so far.&quot; &quot;No, no, good
						man; I have staid too long; good bye.&quot; &quot;Well, then, I must begin
						already to relieve you from the trouble of walking;&quot; and, so saying, he
						took her up in his arms, and, in spite of her cries and endeavours to get
						loose, ran off as if he were carrying a child. This was Gambalunga, the bold
						Gambalunga, in person. His comrades, who were waiting for him, hidden on the
						hill of Santa Croce, no sooner saw him than they leapt forth with joyful
						acclamations.</p></quote>

				<p>The pursuit of the villagers, with Brancaleone at their head, brings on the
					catastrophe of the story, which, after many perils to the lovers, and romantic
					incidents, ends happily. The whole presents a pleasing and lively picture of the
					Italians&#8212;their vehement passions, which lead them right on to their
					object, accompanied, at the same time, by a sense of natural justice and
					open-hearted frankness, and adorned by unaffected and gentle manners. This, too,
					mixed up with so much of wickedness in the bad characters as give darker shades
					of interest to the tale. We think a translation of this romance would be popular
					in England.</p>
