            <p rendition="#pnoindent">I<hi rendition="#smcaps">t</hi> is the fashion to call
						the Italians fallen and degraded; and none are more acrimonious in their
						censures than the Anglo-Italiansâa race which, while forgetting their
						patriotic duties in the delights of that paradisaics climateâwhile
						availing themselves of the benevolence and courtesy of the
						inhabitantsâand while eating the fruits of that fertile
						landâwithout care or annoyance, repay the advantages they enjoy by
						abusing the natives. There is a gentleness, a facility, a kindliness in the
						Italians which spreads an atmosphere of repose around them. Their visitors
						feel and enjoy this; but, far from being grateful, they blind themselves to
						the virtues which benefit themselves, and fix their eyes on the faults which
						are injurious only to the Italians. They even go further, and often rail the
						louder, while they imitate more grossly the vices they denounce.</p>
            <p>Most of the defects of the Italians are those that always arise in a society
						debarred from active duties. An Italian has no career, and can find
						occupation only in intrigue and vice. The utter hopelessness that pervades
						their political atmosphere, the stagnation of every territorial or
						commercial enterprise, the discouragement cast over every
						improvement,âall these are checks to laudable ambition; and yet such
						is not entirely checked. How many Italian hearts beat high for their
						country. When any opening has presented itself, how many victims have rushed
						into the breach. Perhaps in the history of no people in the world has there
						appeared so tenacious a love of country and of liberty, nor so great a
						readiness shown to make every sacrifice to acquire independence, nor so
						confirmed and active an hatred for tyranny.</p>
            <p>After various struggles, and the destruction of their best citizens by the
						despot, still the Italians pant for freedom, and hope to attain it. The
						well-educated among them feel that their chief duty is, to counteract the
						pernicious effects of slavery and superstition in debasing the national
						character. To do this, several of the most eminent have turned authors, and
						risked property and safety for the holy task of disseminating principles and
						sentiments which, in their effect, will keep alive a sense of their rights
						in the minds of their countrymen, and render them worthy of the liberty they
						hope one day to see them enjoy.</p>
            <p>They are fortunate in one circumstanceâthe soil they would cultivate is
						rich and fertile. The thing that chiefly strikes any one conversant with the
						Italians, is their quick and clear understandings. In unfrequented parts of
						England, the people are stupid, and even savage. In France, they are still
						worse. They may practise the domestic virtues, but their minds are shrunk
						and shrivelled, or covered by so impenetrable an husk, that there are no
						means of having communication with them. The facilities of
						intercourseâfor ever multiplying in this countryâand the better
						education that subsists, has partly done away with this state of things; but
						in Italy, the peasant of its remotest regions is a conversable being. He has
						intelligence, imagination, and the power of expression. He has fewer
						prejudices in favour of old habits, a greater reverence for knowledge in
						others: it is easy, therefore, to teach him. While the same divine bounty
						that has gifted him with a capacity to understand, has been also extended to
						his instructors; and the educated men of Italy are singularly able,
						laborious, <fw type="sig" rendition="#smcaps" place="bottom-center">e e
							4</fw>
               <pb n="416"/>and enlightened. Italians are found to excel in every
						province of literature. The names of their poets rank among the highest:
						their novelists, either tragic or comic, are unsurpassed: their historians
						yield only to those of the ancient world. In science, in morals, in every
						species of inventive or disquisitive literature, we find Italians among the
						foremost in desert. No wonder their rulers fear such a people, and put in
						action all their efforts either to crush or turn aside from any, to them
						injurious, purpose, the labours of their men of genius and learning. Thus
							<ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Ugo Foscolo</ref> was banished;
						thus <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> was corrupted; the
						eloquent and admirable productions of the lover of liberty were proscribed;
						and not only were the writings of the slave impregnated with a base spirit,
						but his very subjects were dictated to him. To turn aside the thoughts of
						the men of letters from an elevated and useful aim, <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> was commanded to raise
						that pitiful war of words which sprung from his
							"<title>Proposta</title>."<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> and of asserting the
						propriety of adopting, as the classic language of Italy, a language not
						wholly Tuscan, but intermingled with modes of speech peculiar to other
						provinces. <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> and his
						son-in-law, <ref target="people.html#PerticariGiulio">Perticari</ref>, began
						what they called a crusade against the "Della Crusca." <ref target="people.html#PerticariGiulio">Perticari</ref>, young and
						virtuous, and led by <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref>,
						was probably innocent of any sinister motive. <ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref> himself entered into the
						views of the Austrians: he knew his countrymen, and the unfortunate
						prejudices in Italy, which makes one portion the rival and enemy of another.
						The effect of his attack was electric. As if it had been the cause of
						independence, each literary man arose to defend the system of his country.
						The Tuscans thought their territory invaded, their dearest privileges
						undermined: the war continued for years. At present, many of the chief
						combatants are no more, while the few survivors may wonder at their folly at
						being thus entrapped to forget the nobler uses of their talents in so
						puerile a question; they may feel that had one among them written a book, in
						which genius and power had been clothed in elegant and forcible language,
						drawn either from the purest Tuscan source, or mingled with modes of speech
						deemed less classical, yet not less true to feeling, it had been a far
						better answer than volumes of verbal dispute. </p>
            <p>The Austrians, though they corrupted one of the greatest geniuses of Italy
							(<ref target="people.html#MontiVincenzo">Monti</ref>), and sent another
							(<ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Foscolo</ref>) to die in a foreign
						land, and were successful in causing all the talents of the country to be
						absorbed by a war of words, yet enjoyed only a temporary success. Deeper
						interests were awakened among the Italians during the outbreaks and
						struggles which marked the years 1820-21. Since then, their writers have
						been thoroughly awakened to the importance of their task in enlightening
						their countrymen, and in teaching them either lessons of Christian virtue,
						or animating them to a love of liberty. </p>
            <p>A very excellent article has appeared in the eleventh number of
							"<title>The London and Westminster Review</title>," written,
						we believe, by a peculiarly clever and well-informed Italian resident in

               </hi> which throws great
						light on the moving springs of Italian literature. The author has, with
						great judgment, divided the writers of his country into two classes, both
						bent on ameliorating the character of their fellow countrymen, but by
						different means: the one aims at fostering the, so to speak, inoffensive
						virtues; the other, burning with a hatred of the oppressor, and with a
						thirst for the deliverance of their native land, endeavors to strengthen and
						elevateâto teach the Italians to become patriots and citizensâto
						inspire, <pb n="417"/>not resignation, but hopeânot merely piety and
						benevolence, but ardour for the dissemination of the blessings of
						civilisation and freedomânot simply fortitude, but active courage,
						without which higher virtues, they are aware that Italy can never be
						delivered and renovated.</p>
            <p>Amidst the whole field of literature which <ref target="people.html#MazziniGiuseppe">Mazzini</ref> glances over, we
						select only one portionâits novels and romances.</p>
            <p>When a new sort of literature was, as it were, discovered, and men of the
						first talent in France and England occupied themselves by the composition of
						romances and novelsâall sorts of fictitious adventure in prose,
						whether belonging to past ages or modern mannersâit was to be supposed
						that the Italians would shine also in the same career. At first, however,
						they did not originate any work of the sort worthy of themselves, and it
						grew into a common opinion that the spirit of Italy was so crushed and
						deadened, that their writers had fallen into a low scale. <ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Ugo Foscolo</ref> was a mere imitator in
						his "<title>Jacopo Ortis</title>." But <ref target="people.html#FoscoloUgo">Foscolo</ref> was strictly a didactic
						writer. His refined and discerning mind, his eloquent and enthusiastic
						spirit, which dictated his labours on <ref target="people.html#PetrarcaFrancesco">Petrarch</ref> and <ref target="people.html#Dante">Dante</ref>, and his poem of the
							"<title>Sepolcri</title>"âthe most finished elegy of
						modern Italy, was not inventive of facts. "<title>Jacopo
						Ortis</title>" was a vehicle for opinions and emotionsânot an
						epic, whose incidents and conduct were to interest and delight. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> redeemed the
						reputation of his country. The "<title>Promessi Sposi</title>,"
						translated into every European language, is proof that the Italians are
						still themselves. It yields to no romance of any country in graphic
						descriptionsâin eloquenceâin touching incident and forcible
						reflection. It is, however, so entirely Italian in all its parts, that it
						can only be truly relished in its native guise. It has seized and
						individualised, as it were, various species of human beings, specimens of
						which can be found only in that soil; and thus, to a certain degree, its
						reputation must be local. Any one conversant with the Italian character
						perceives at once the truth and vividness of the picture; to others it is a
						fancy piece, and cannot come home in the same way to their experience and
						sympathies; besides that, the translation is vapid and lifeless, and
						incapable of communicating the spirit of the original. The excellence of
						this work consists, in the first place, in its admirable discrimination and
						representation of character. Its personages are not shadows and vague
						generalities, but men and women stamped with individuality. They all live
						and move before usâwe feel as if we should recognise if we saw
						themâand those who have been in Italy have seen such, and perceive not
						portraits, but vivid resemblances. We have seen and recognise Don Abbondio,
						and his servant Perpetua; their modes of thinking and phraseology are all
						familiar to us, though graced in the work with the ideality which marks the
						perfection of art. The spirit and reality of such portions as may pass for
						episodes, the stories of Gertrude and Cristofero, are unsurpassed in any
						work, in any language, for interest, truth, and beauty. The conversion of
						the Innominatoâthe riots at Milanâthe progress, prevalence, and
						cessation of the plague, are passages of high-wrought eloquence that carry
						the reader along with them. They show not only the deepest knowledge of the
						human heart, but a vivid graphic talent, surpassing that of every modern
						tale-writer. The defect of the work is its whole. Admirable in parts, it
						wants the artifice of plot, which should make the interest rise continually.
						From the moment that Lucia is liberated by the Innominato, the story, such
						as it is, comes to a stop. Much of this arises from the character of her
						betrothed. She herself, gentle, resigned, and affectionate, interests us
						more than that sort of person in a book usually does; but Renzo is not her
						fitting lover. It is <pb n="418"/>true that he is nature itself, the
						absolute portrait of an Italian rustic. We ought to be content that Lucia, a
						Milanese peasant, should have for a husband a person in the same situation
						of life; but the sweetness and blameless simplicity of the heroine removes
						her from the vulgarities of her situation, while Renzo is immersed in them;
						the discrepancy jars on our taste, and injures the tale as a work of
						art.</p>
            <p>The author of the "<title>Promessi Sposi</title>" has not aimed at
						inspiring ardour for liberty and hatred of the tyrant: his lessons are
						rather those of piety and resignation. In any other work we might blame
						this; but the truth is so much better than declamation, and the picture he
						gives of the evils of misrule and ignorance is so forcible, that it stands
						in lieu of didactic tirades. The effect of the book being to impress the
						reader with a deep sense of the mischiefs that ensue from a people being
						kept in a state of bigotry and ignorance, and from a foreign, inert, and
						short-sighted government, every un-prejudiced person must reap a
						well-founded hatred of tyrants and superstition from such worth a thousand
						diatribes.</p>
            <p>This want of a generous and enlarged aim is more to be deplored for the
						author than the work. <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> is a man of first-rate genius. Besides the
							"<title>Promessi Sposi</title>," he has written two
							tragedies<hi rendition="#sup">

						according to the French notion of the Athenian theatre, but interspersed
						with choruses. As dramas, these plays are defectiveâas poems, they are
						highly beautiful. There is, in particular, a chorus in the
							"<title>Camaledole</title>" on the horrors of war and the
						blessings of peace, which may rank among the most beautiful lyrics in the
						Italian language. But the want of moral energy that blinds a Milanese to the
						real evils that afflict his country, superstition and despotism, has fallen
						heavily on the poet. <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> has become a bigot and a slave. His life is spent in
						churches. His thoughts and actions are under the government of a priest, in
						obedience to whose dictates he has destroyed a beautiful romance on the
						subject of <ref target="people.html#Napoleon">Napoleon.</ref> Thus that

								note]</note>
               </hi>," has fallen with club-like weight on the
						head of this illustrious man, crushing his genius, rendering him ungrateful
						to his Creator for the surpassing gifts of mind lavished on him, causing him
						to "hide his light under a bushel;" so that, at the great account,
						when asked to what use he put the vast bounty of God, in giving him powers
						of soul superior to the multitude, he can only answer, "I disdained
						your gift, and regarded the telling of my beads as the chief end and aim of
						an intelligent beingâs life." Miserable, indeed, are the effects of
						catholicism, which causes the believer to surrender his conscience into the
						hands of another; which deprives man of his best privilege, that of judging
						by his innate sense of right and wrong; and utterly brutalises him, as he
						regulates his sense of duty by a fictitious code of morality, invented for
						the sole purpose of enslaving him, instead of resting it on the plain
						precepts of enlightened religion; which, while it teaches us to "love
						our neighbour as ourself," will also teach that the best proof a man of
						genius can give of his obedience to this command, is to enlighten the
						ignorant, and animate to virtue the demoralisedâa task that can in no
						way be so well fulfilled as by the multiplication of works that will
						convince the head of the excellence of right, and warm the heart with
						courage to exercise it. </p>

						over by a branch of the house of Aragon for the space of sixty-five years,
						when <ref target="people.html#CharlesVIII">Charles VIII.</ref>, King of
						France, was stimulated by the treachery and ambition of a prince of Milan to
						bring forward the claim of the house of Anjou. He (and then first those
						disastrous wars began, when the French met the Spaniard on the fields of
						Italy) entered the Peninsula, and overran and possessed himself of Naples:
						but, on his return to his native kingdom, he lost his conquest as speedily
						as he had gained it. On his death, which soon after followed, his successor,
							<ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis XII.</ref>, prosecuted the same
						claim to the Neapolitan crown. <ref target="people.html#FrederickIV">Frederic</ref>, king of Naples, turned for assistance to his relative,
							<ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref> of Spain,
						who, making the fairest promises, acted with the utmost treachery. He and
							<ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> agreed to dispossess the
						reigning sovereign, and to divide the kingdom between them. <ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> was to possess the Abruzzi and
						the Terra di Lavoro; <ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref>, Calabria and Puglia. The Pope ratified this compact.
						For a time, however, it was kept secret. <ref target="people.html#LouisXII">Louis</ref> invaded Naples, but <ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref> promised his
						kinsman succour, and sent, apparently for that purpose, him whom the
						Spaniards name the "great captain," â <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo de Cordova</ref>. The
						catastrophe was soon brought about: the French overran the northern portion
						of the kingdom of Naples; Capua was besieged, and taken by treason; and <ref target="people.html#FrederickIV">Frederic</ref>, while he hoped to find
						assistance in the Spaniards, was informed of the treachery of <ref target="people.html#FerdinandIIAragon">Ferdinand</ref>. Dispossessed of
						his kingdom, he first retired to Ischia, and afterwards took refuge in
						France. The French and Spaniards, after some resistance on the part of the
						eldest son of <ref target="people.html#FrederickIV">Frederic</ref>,
						possessed themselves of the land: peace, however, was not the result. The
						division they had agreed upon was not made so carefully but that room was
						left to dispute the boundaries. At first, the rival pretensions were
						amicably arranged in a meeting of <ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Louis d'Armagnac</ref>, Duc de NÃ©mours, the French viceroy,
						with <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo de Cordova</ref>: but
						this was of short duration, and war speedily broke out. The Spanish party
						was weak and unprovided, and <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo</ref>, to gain time, fortified himself at Barletta, there to
						await the arrival of succour from Spain, and to wear out the French by a war
						of outposts. The Neapolitans themselves were divided; the Aragonese party
						adhering to Spain; the partisans of the house of Anjou, to France: the
						former, however, considered themselves as the real patriotic party, and
						treated their antagonists as traitors.</p>
            <p>The<ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis"> Duc de NÃ©mours</ref>
						blockaded Barletta: both generals avoided attacks and general engagements,
						while the numerous chivalry on both sides satisfied their martial tastes and
						thirst for honour by various challenges and duels. <ref target="people.html#CordobaGonzalo">Gonzalvo</ref> reaped every
						advantage from this species of warfare, and in the delay that ensued. The
							<ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Duc de NÃ©mours</ref>
						endeavoured to draw his antagonist into battle, and failed; but, while
						despising an enemy who refused to fight, he marched with the utmost
						carelessness. The Spaniards fell on his troops, and made a great many
						prisoners.</p>
            <p>Among these was Charles Hennuyer de la Motte, a French officer of
						distinguished bravery. He and his friends in misfortune were invited to
						partake of a feast given by <ref target="people.html#MendozaDiego">Mendoza</ref>, his conqueror. During the conversation that took place
						on this occasion, <ref target="people.html#MendozaDiego">Mendoza</ref>
						attributed his victory to the admirable monÅuvring of the Italian
						cavalry, commanded by <ref target="people.html#ColonnaProspero">Prospero
							Colonna</ref>. The French despised the Italians; and La Motte exclaimed
						that, vanquished as they were on all occasions, they could not presume to
						compare <pb n="420"/>with the French in any species of warfare, and were
						only worthy to hold the stirrup to the knights of France. The good humour of
						the festival was not interrupted by this insult, but, on the morrow, <ref target="people.html#ColonnaProspero">Prospero Colonna</ref> called on La
						Motte to retract his words: he refused. The honour of both nations appeared
						to be engaged; and the generals on either side permitted the question to be
						decided by an appeal to arms. Thirteen Italians and thirteen Frenchman,
						completely armed, agreed to meet in the lists to fight till they fell, or
						were made prisoners. The lists were selected midway between Barletta and the
						quarters of the <ref target="people.html#ArmagnacLouis">Duc de
							NÃ©mours</ref>. They were surrounded only by a furrow made by a
						ploughshare; but it was settled that, whoever among the combatants could be
						driven beyond this boundary, must surrender as vanquished. The Italians were
						victorious. The French having in their presumption neglected to bring with
						them the hundred apiece, agreed on as ransom, were led prisoners to
						Barletta.</p>
            <p>Such is the history of the celebrated challenge which <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> has made the ornament
						of his tale. This work has already been translatedâbadly enough; but
						the mere English reader has probably gathered the gist of the story from the
						translation, as well as from any skeleton account that we can give. The
						first thing that strikes the Italian reader, on commencing the perusal, is
						the purity and elegant simplicity of the style. This merit is lost in the
						translation. It is more difficult, perhaps, to translate well from the
						Italian than any other language; for the peculiarity of its prose is a
						wordiness unendurable in any other; and it requires a thorough knowledge of
						the genius of the language, as well as considerable practice in authorship,
						at once to preserve the peculiar style of the author, and to produce a
						readable book. </p>
            <p>The beauty of <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>'s
						writing is very great: it is forcible, without exaggeration; elegant,
						without effort; and in this is very well adapted to the characteristic of
						his work, which derives its merit from its story, rather than from masterly
						delineation of character. It is not that the plot is perfect, especially
						according to our ideas; but it is congruous in its parts, and deeply
						interesting as a whole. The ill-fated pair of lovers are presented to us in
						situations full of pathos: the delicacy of sentiment and heroism which they
						display redeems their position from its usual difficulties. A wife,
						disliking her husband, and loving another man, is a subject, the topics of
						which are so obvious, that it is rather a favourite with modern
						novel-writers; yet it is always infinitely displeasing. <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> has managed it far
						better than any other: the passionate, yet regulated, love of the gentle
						Ginevra, which she broods over in her island convent; the deep, religious
						devotion of Fieramosca to her and to virtue; the dark terrors that surround
						them, as well as the chivalric glory that adorns and gilds both themselves
						and all that surrounds them, sheds grace over every page; and, though these
						characters are rather shadowed forth than strongly marked, and others are
						but sketched, yet the few lines we perceive are masterly, and so much in
						keeping, that though the whole picture is, so to speak, presented in a
						subdued light, there is no obscurity, nor confusion, nor distortion. The
						only fault we find is in the personage <ref target="people.html#BorgiaCesare">CÃ¦sar Borgia</ref>. He acts at
						once too subordinate and too influential a part. Kept for the most part in
						the background, he yet is the most important actor on the scene:ânor
						does his conduct seem natural: he, the most restless and fiery of men, is
						described as being content to remain secreted for many days in a secret
						chamber of his enemy's fortress, for no sufficing reason, and then,
						unexpectedly, the most disgusting and heinous crime is thrown in his path,
						which he commits, and then disappears. We may be hypercritical: it would be
						unnatural to place a romance in that age, and <pb n="421"/>people it with
						such personages, and not introduce crime in the foreground. But a
						romance-writer must never rest the justification of his plot on bare truth,
						without adding the dress of art. In real life, our acts and impulses are
						often most motiveless, in our own eyes, when once past; but in fiction we
						ought always to feel the enchainment of events as inevitable. <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref> wished to paint his
						heroine the greatest virtue triumphing over the greatest misfortune: for
						this he makes her die deceived as to her lover, and believing him
						inconstant. We feel the heroism of her character, but recoil from the trial
						to which it is put, and we would fain that Donna Elvira, herself undeceived,
						had undeceived Ginevra, and that her last moment had been gladdened by the
						consciousness of Fieramosca's truth, which, if she had already forgiven
						her rival, would not have detracted from the height of her virtue. We
						scarcely know any passage in any author impregnated with a more pathetic
						spirit than the conclusion of the novel. The night that Fieramosca passes
						preceding the great duel; his endeavours to believe that all is well with
						Ginevra; and the unquiet emotions inspired by the scarce audible psalmody
						over the dead, and by the beams of the light which, in truth, was placed
						beside the corpse of her he loved, whom he thought living; are touched with
						a truth and delicacy that go to the heart. The lighter parts of the work are
						also admirable: the bull-fightâthe feastâthe characters of
						Fanfulla, Paredes, &amp;c., are entertaining and sprightly; and the
						description of the great duel itself is brilliant and spirited. There is
						both pathos and humour in different portions of the tale, but there is no
						wit. The Italians are not a witty people, nor does their language lend
						itself to wit: the peculiarity before mentioned, its wordiness, is against a
						quality whose characteristic is brevity and terseness. <ref target="people.html#ManzoniAlessandro">Manzoni</ref> is highly humorous
						in <title>Don Abbondio</title>, but he is never witty; and the same with
							<ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>; the same with
						every other Italian prose writer; the same will be found in their
						conversation. In this, as in almost every other quality of mind, they are in
						contrast with the French.</p>
            <p>The challenge of the Barletta is so dear to the Italians, that it has been
						selected to adorn the pages of another novel of great merit.
							"<title>The first Viceroy of Naples</title>" (<title>Il Primo
							Vicere di Napoli</title>) deserves honourable mention in this account of
						Italian romances. It is the work of <ref target="people.html#CapocciErnesto">Capocci</ref>, a Neapolitan, a celebrated astronomer, and a man of
						profound learning. Deeming that the acknowledgement of so light a production
						might injure his reputation as a man of science, he has put the name of
						Belmonte, which was that of his mother, in the titlepage; and, with that
						pride in honouring those they love, which belongs to the Italians, he has
						dedicated it to his wife, a lady of great merit and talents.</p>
            <p>The warriors of Barletta are the heroes of this tale. Fieramosca and
						Brancaleone are introduced as principal personages; and one of the first
						incidents is the meeting of the latter with his friend's sister, and
						their mutual and sudden attachment. But the spirit of the romance is in
						absolute contrast with <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>'s. "<title>Hector Fieramosca</title>" is a
						tale of living, struggling humanity: it describes individuals suffering
						misfortune and deep sorrow, occasioned by such events as grow out of the
						situation of their country, and the characters of their contemporaries. It
						is almost too real for fiction in its disappointments, long-enduring griefs,
						and tragic catastrophe; while "<title>The First Viceroy of
							Naples</title>" is, as far as plot is concerned, the commonplace
						loves of a boy and girl, whose attachment, after a series of adventures and
						disasters, ends in a happy marriage. One of the chief merits of this book is
						its simplicity, both of style and sentiment. Wearied by the tendency to
						bombast now prevailing in literature, the reader is charmed by the <pb n="422"/>ease of the language, and becomes interested unawares in the
						tissue of incidents, artlessly but agreeably combined. The tale begins with
						the siege of Capua, mentioned in the sketch given above of the progress of
						these wars; and here an episode is introduced, which is a good specimen of
						the manner and power of the author, though, from its length, it must be
						somewhat abridged.</p>
            <p>Antonello Caracciolo, the head of one of the noblest families of Naples, was
						a youth of great promise; he was courteous and gentle; and this in spite of
						the evil lessons of a natural brother, Raymond, who stimulated him to acts
						of folly and vice: his only faults were such as belonged to his few years.
						He became enamoured of a peasant girl, the daughter of one of his Calabrian
						vassals. This girl had a brother, Rocco, a man of giant force and vehement
						passions, a ruffianâwho was only not a bandit, because he still loved
						his parents and his sister. Raymond perceived his brother's attachment
						to Constance, and conceived a plan of villany to get her into his power. A
						man had been assassinated near her dwelling; her brother was at a distance.
						Raymond accused her father of the murder, and threw him into prison; and
						then instigated her mother to go, accompanied by Constance, and throw
						herself at Antonello's feet. The conclusion may be guessed: the
						daughter was led away, the mother roughly dismissed, but with the intimation
						that her request was granted. The father was liberated, and returned; but,
						when he found that the ransom paid was his daughter's honour, he broke
						out into the fiercest imprecations; and his son suddenly at this moment
						returning, he threatened to curse him unless he washed out the stain on the
						family by some act of dire revenge. Rocco, foiled in his attempt to see
						Raymond, is driven by insult to assassinate several of Antonello's
						followers, and flies to the mountains. That same night terrible signs of his
						fury were visible in the vast possessions of the prince, and dreadful fires
						marked the fatal rise of the most famous bandit of an age in which so many
						flourished.</p>
            <p>The father appealed for vengeance for his wrongs to his sovereign. Antonello
						had taken refuge in Naples with his peasant mistress, to whom he had become
						passionately attached. An order was issued that the family of Caracciolo
						should deliver him up to justice; and when this command was disobeyed, a
						party of masons were sent to raze the houses of the family, with an order to
						level one after the other to the ground, till Antonello should be found. On
						this the unfortunate youth was delivered up, and condemned to death. The
						tale continues:â</p>
            <quote>
               <p>Then a marriage was mentioned, which at first gave rise to rejoicing;
							but, when the family began no longer to fear for the life of their
							relative, they declared that death was to be preferred to such a
							disgrace. Nor was there a noble to whom it did not appear excessive
							injustice to proceed as severely as if the two parties had been of equal
							rank. It seemed strange to them to give the same attention to the
							complaints of an injured vassal, as if he were a count or a baron. But
							every father and every brother, born out of the privileged class,
							exulted in his heart, as the chimera, which had a hundred times risen in
							his mind, of impartial justice in such cases, appeared on the point of
							being realised.</p>
               <p>One morning the inhabitants of the market-place saw a black scaffold
							elevated in the middle of the square; and immediately a vast crowd
							assembled, more than usually eager to witness so important an execution.
							The spacious circuit was soon filled, and soon the press grew so great,
							that the people, jammed together, appeared to lose all elasticity, and
							to be fused into one mass. There were people on the belfreys, at the
							windows in the balconies: they covered the tops of the houses, the sides
							of the fountains, the <pb n="423"/>cornices of the shops and palaces.
							The unfortunate Antonello, taken from his dungeon, was led in a cart
							through one of those narrow alleys of the old city of Naples, in which
							there were none but the cart and the guard that escorted it. When this
							party turned into the market-place, the vast crowd, with one voice,
							uttered a loud involuntary shout. The hapless youth, dismayed by the
							spectacle, almost lost his senses. The terrible truth presented to his
							sight was hidden by a delirium not less terrible. A mist is before his
							eyesâa ringing in his earsâa cold moisture pervades his
							bodyâhis heart palpitates to burstingâtrembling and
							tottering, every thing turns roundâall seems giving way, and
							falling into an abyss. The vehement curiosity of the multitude at first
							sight of Caracciolo immediately changed to pity. Each uncovered his head
							at the sign of salvation that headed the sad procession, and all
							remained still and silent. It was a solemn spectacle, when each of so
							many thousands of men was so preoccupied, that you might have fancied
							yourself in a desert. At the sudden change the delirium of Antonello
							also changed: it appeared to him as if the pavement of the immense
							square had been taken up, and that, instead of stones, it was laid down
							with human heads, and that he and the executioner were alone in the
							empty space, while the latter stretched out his hand to seize his hair.
							O horror! his head is about to fall among the rest! He wished to
							shriekâto stopâto fly! but an irresistible forceâthe
							power of fateâprevents his moving, and carries him on towards the
							scaffold. The cart proceeded amidst the press, which, deaf to the signs
							of the attendants, opened with difficulty to the curvets and leaps of
							the horses of the armed men, and then closing behind, as the waves of
							the sea after a vessel, while it seemed to the unfortunate man that at
							these moments the earth was opening to swallow him. Those who were near
							saw clearly the internal struggles caused by these visions in the
							contortion of his limbs and convulsion of his features, but the violence
							of the agony prevented its long continuance, and he fell fainting in the
							arms of the priest. When they arrived at the foot of the scaffold, he
							came to himself, and sighed, and exclaimed, in a voice of woe, "My
							God! where am I? am I alive? where is Constance? where my mother?"
							Then, opening his eyes, he looked fixedly round, till, shuddering and
							turning away, he cried, "No, no!âhe is still
							thereâNoâI am not yet dead!" Now the comforting voice
							of the holy minister came to his aid, and the unexpected sight of his
							Constance, who had arrived by another way, entirely restored his
							courage. Forgetting the chains that held him back, he was about to
							advance and embrace her. Hope returned, and he thought, "It cannot
							be trueâthe duchess does not hate meâhow have I injured her?
							she has always been kind to meâI cannot forget it: at the last
							festival at Poggio Reale the duchess and the king were peculiarly
							courteous: it is a mere show, no more. What wild beast, what tiger,
							would be so cruel? and to one of my rankâand at my age! No, it is
							impossibleâit is folly to imagine otherwise! Constance is all my
							regret; the hapless Constance, made by me the fable of her native place,
							and now of the whole kingdom. Unhappy girlâI suffer, and deserve
							it; but you, innocent creature, you, indeed, will become the wife of
							Antonello Caracciolo yet; so that it will seem that I am forced to marry
							her, while, in truth, there is nothing in the world I desire
							moreânothingânot even life!" And these same thoughts
							passed through the minds of the spectators.</p>
               <p>They ascend the scaffold. The feebleness of the youth need not excite
							surpriseâwho ascends between two white-clad monks, and seems bowed
							by age. See you not how each step adds years to his age? That ill-omened
							throng of priests and monks freeze the blood, and the extreme youth of
								<pb n="424"/>the condemned man inspires deep pity. But the sight of
							the girl, who was the innocent cause of the punishment, excited a more
							tender emotion, and softened the hardest heart. The peril of Antonello,
							whom she already regarded as a beloved husband, was an insupportable
							torment to her. Now, pale and ghastly, she had fallen if she had not
							been supportedânow, changing colour and blushing, she trembled and
							shuddered, and was convulsed as by the most acute pain. Sometimes she
							raised her eyes to heaven, sometimes she turned them fearfully round to
							find a spot where she could look without meeting the gaze of
							othersâsometimes she covered her face with her hands, as she
							appeared to invoke death or the termination of her agony.</p>
               <p>An altar and a block were both placed on the scaffold. When the two young
							beings drew near to celebrate the enforced nuptials, they rushed into
							each other's arms, and held each other in a long embrace. They were
							forcibly separated, that the rite might be fulfilled; Constance was
							dowered by the prince according to his rank: she received the bridal
							ring, and the priest blessed them. The crowd who witnessed this moving
							ceremony could not restrain from tearsâthe very agents wept; and
							who would not? But all did not finish here. The same priest who had
							pronounced the sacred words which gave rise to a new source of life, the
							very same chaunted forth the comforting psalms that were used to precede
							the death of the condemned, and to announce the violent separation of a
							being, guilty though he were, yet our fellow-creature, from the rest of
							the world. What a tremendous moment! New sprung hope had pitilessly
							deceived the unfortunate Antonello. Hope had given him strength to feel
							the spasms of agony till the last moment, as is made manifest by the
							accent in which he repeats the prayers. And yet he doubts; he does not
							abandon hope; but, alas! the executioner seizes him, and forces him to
							kneel beside the block.</p>
               <p>Already the axe is raised, when a murmur, none knows whence originating,
							and then a clamour, is heard among the crowd, crying, Pardon! pardon!
							And can it be? A horseman endeavours to make his way towards the
							scaffold. Room is eagerly made. Does he not bring a pardon? Profound
							silence returns. None can take their eyes from him, yet all desire to
							gaze on Antonello, and they are eager to see both at once. The officer
							being arrived opposite, made a sign to those on the scaffold; and in a
							moment, the severed head of Caracciolo was seen shaking, hanging by the
							hair, as it was held up by the blood-stained hand of the executioner.
							The eyes were seen to roll, and words and blood to flow from the lips.
							At the same moment, a piercing shriek was heard, as it were the
							concentrated expression of general horror; and the woman who gave forth
							that shriek fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>A gloomy murmur arose from the sea of heads. It moved and opened in a
							hundred parts, and the whole crowd, horrified and frightened, separated
							at once. The ill-fated Constance never rose more. Whether it were
							surprise, or shame, at finding herself the object of so many eyes at an
							ignominious spectacleâwhether compassion for her lover, or whether
							poison had been given her, as was reported, by his relationsâshe
							died.</p>
               <p>The marble effigy of these unhappy lovers, placed above the arch of the
							steeple of St. Eligio, in the midst of the market-place, reminds the
							passer-by of their miserable fate.</p>
            </quote>
            <p>The account given in this work of the duel itself is peculiarly striking. The
						unaffected simplicity of the style rises into dignity when supported by the
						importance of the subject. It is, in some respects, superior to <ref target="people.html#AzeglioMassimo">Azeglio</ref>'s, especially in
						the interest it excites. The duel in "<title>Hector
						Fieramosca</title>" is placed at the end of the work. The reader has
						been deeply affected by the <pb n="425"/>wrongs and death of Ginevra: the
						duel serves neither to avenge her, nor to advance any portion of the story;
						and loses its natural interest from its taking place when that of the story
						to which it is appended has drawn to the close. In <ref target="people.html#CapocciErnesto">Belmonte</ref>'s romance it
						takes place early in the tale, and the personages are full of ardour, hope,
						and enjoyment. We extract a portion, as a further specimen of the merits of
						this work; a good translation of which we should be glad to see among our
						English romances.</p>
            <quote>
               <p>The Italian combatants had heard mass, and sworn to die rather than
							survive a defeat, and to defend each other till death. They then set
							forward to the appointed place. Half way they met their four judges, who
							told them that they had conferred with the judges of the adverse party,
							and fixed the conditions of the fight; but that the French had not yet
							arrived. However, Hector Fieramosca, believing the hour agreed upon to
							be not far off, thought it right not to delay: and, advancing slowly for
							the space of another mile, arrived at the field. It was a lonely spot,
							half way between Quarata and Andria, where even now may be seen the
							fragments of the monument which was erected there in memory of that
							glorious day, excellently adapted by nature for the purpose; for the
							soil around is wavy with various irregularities; but here it becomes
							completely even and plain, and, for a sufficient space, spreads itself
							into the form of an amphitheatre, unencumbered by any hinderance of tree
							or rock, while an olive wood flourishes around, forming, as it were, a
							thick garland. The little plain, being rather low, was covered, through
							the effects of rain, by a fine shingle, and offered a perfect arena for
							the manÅuvres of the horsemen. On this occasion, the lists selected
							in the midst of this plain were surrounded by a furrow that enclosed
							about the eighth part of a mile, and was marked at intervals by large
							stones. Due egress was given between these to the combatants, who,
							defeated in the combat, were forced to surrender as vanquished. A seat
							was prepared for the judges at one extremity of the field, on a jutting
							ridge of earth, and a magnificent scarlet canopy was raised under the
							olives. Before and around, but lower down, stood the trumpeters and
							heralds, who attended on the joust.</p>
               <p>When the Italians arrived, they were struck by the singular aspect of the
							field. There was no crowd pressing to and fro without the listsâno
							waving of scarfs and handkerchiefsâno impatient nor welcoming
							cries at the appearance of the combatantsâall was lonely and
							quiet. But this gave a more solemn aspect to the scene, as this solitude
							did not arise from any want of spectators, but from urgent necessity,
							and, so to speak, a holy reverence: for afar off, in the neighbourhood
							of Andria and Corato, were to be seen many companies of horsemen, who
							had no other object than to wait on the necessities of the combat; and,
							scattered abroad through the country on the limits of the field,
							innumerable groups of spectators were to be seen clustered upon
							straw-ricks and trees, who, in a moment, could have walled in the
							circuit of the lists, had they been allowed to approach.</p>
               <p>The Italians dismounted, and, kneeling down, implored the protection of
							the God of Armies; and then, while waiting for the arrival of the enemy,
							Hector addressed his party thus:â"Brothers and companions, I
							should be devoid of understanding, did I think, by my words, to inspire
							with courage warriors chosen by our illustrious leader as the flower of
							his troop. No, my friends, we know each other well. But, since the enemy
							have not yet made their appearance, I have thought it right in this
							interval to open my mind, which augurs undoubted victory. In times past,
							many have fought for the sake of private enmityâothers to acquire
							wealth or powerâothers for the love of ladies. But you combat for
							honour and glory, the <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left">

                  <pb n="426"/>most

							but for that of the whole Italian nation. May this inspire you, and gift
							you with immortal renown, making you famous examples of patriotic
							valour, and the enduring theme of noble recollection to posterity. Yes,
							my friends, this combat will be regarded with infinite anxiety by the
							army, by Italy, by the whole world; and the names of the valiant men who
							shall remain conquerers on the field will go down to the remotest
							posterity. I will not allude to the enemy's arrogance and injurious
							contempt. May Heaven avert that any of us survive to see the seal put to
							our shame. What more famous pass of arms than this can our descendants
							ever witness? In every other it is a mere game and display: this will be
							a fierce battle. In others, the nature of the arms, and the rules by
							which they are to be used, is establishedâin this we choose for
							ourselves as in war itself. In a tournament the point of the lance is
							bluntâthe swords have no edgeâit is dishonourable to wound a
							horseâit is a felony to strike with the point. Here we wield
							lances, clubs, swords, and daggers; and happy is he who can plunge the
							blade into the heart of his adversary. Yes, happy is he who can reach
							the heart of him who desires to dishonour his bride, his sister, and his
							mother; for such is he who dares to vituperate our country, and cover it
							with infamy. Wherefore, war and death to the French! with every weapon,
							war and death!" At this moment he perceived some on the opposite
							side appear: he became silent, and, ordering his helmet to be laced,
							they mounted their horses, placed their lances in the rests, and began
							to canter lightly, and to caricole about the field, that they might
							become familiar with it.</p>
               <p>The French now presented themselves. First came a gentleman carrying the
							helmet and lance of Monseigneur de la Motte; twelve other gentlemen
							followed, two by two, who in like manner carried the lances and helmets
							of their friends. Then, at fitting intervals, the six couples of
							combatants followed, armed and mounted as the Italians were; then came
							La Motte alone; behind him came his spotted charger, and, lastly, the
							twelve chargers, led by twelve gentlemen, two by two.</p>
               <p>La Motte, seeing that the Italian cavaliers were prepared, alighted from
							his hack, and caused his comrades to dismount also. Custom demanded that
							the leader, on such an occasion, should make a short harangue; but the
							eager La Motte, excited by the sight of the enemy, and naturally adverse
							to all formality, burst forth at once. "There they are, my friends,
							only thirteenâthirteen exactly, as we are! Shall we allow
							ourselves to be vanquished at equal armsâwe, who have always seen
							a double and a triple number fly before us? By my faith! this is the
							first time we have met so exactly; and the best is that they are all
							alike, and there is not one Spaniard among them. Poor wretches! not
							another word about them; there they areâyou behold them so light
							and airyâin a little while not one will be seen on the field.
							Come, let us teach them how arrogant they are to compete with the
							cavaliers of the King of France. But, I implore you, spare that youth on
							the bay, with a blue and white scarf: it belongs to me to attack that

               <p>They then knelt, and addressed a prayer to Heaven, armed themselves, and,

            <p>The combat itself is described with great vivacity, and in particular the <pb n="427"/>encounter of La Motte and Brancaleone. Brancaleone is the hero
						of the tale, but he is a mere youth; and the author, while he wished to
						attribute to him the honour of vanquishing the French leader, felt that it
						was too much to make him fall by his hand. But he extricates himself from
						this difficulty admirably. They had already met and fought, and been
						separated in the mÃªlÃ©e, and now they met again. "The
						dauntless La Motte had begun to lose faith in his unvanquishable prowess;
						since in this species of skirmish his giant stature and immense strength
						were of less avail than the agility of the youth, whom with presumptuous
						confidence he had despised. He writhed, and foamed, and became confused
						through rage; his desire to conquer became a balk; and the more blindly he
						rushed on to wound his adversary, the more he exposed himself to his blows.
						So much blood flowed from his body, and he was wounded in so many places,
						that he no longer feared injury, since, could he strike to earth his daring
						adversary, he had been content to be killed by a thousand wounds. At length,
						among the innumerable blows dealt by La Motte, one reached its aim, and poor
						Brancaleone also poured out a river of blood; and, on recovering from the
						stroke, he staggered so that his enemy thought it all over with him. Then
						his boldness returned; believing that his victory was secure, he turned his
						eyes to the other combatants, to gather the triumph of the entire conflict.
						And, though his companions strewed the field, yet, as he saw some among them
						still on horseback, fighting valiantly, he believed that, could he lend his
						aid, they would conquer. He therefore changed his mode of attack, and became
						cautious, and as avaricious of his blood as before he had been lavish. On
						the other side, Brancaleone, who believed that the blood he spilt must
						inevitably occasion his death, gave, as a light that expires, the last
						flame, and threw himself on La Motte with inexpressible fury; while he,
						warding off the blows, continued to back, and waited to take advantage of
						some good opportunity, afforded by the otherâs fury, to end the great
						struggle by a blow with his club. But, at this crisis, he heard the cry
						aroundâ'La Motte, prisoner! Prisoner, La Motte!' Both
						paused: La Motte looked aroundâhe perceived that he had passed the
						furrow, and was without the lists! A heavy groan burst from him, and he fell
						with extended arms, as if struck by a thunderbolt."</p>
            <p>The story of this work turns on the loves of Brancaleone and Giacinta, the
						sister of Fieramosca; the brother being at first friendly, and then adverse,
						to their marriage. The prince of Caracciolo, drawn on by the instigations of
						his bastard brother, Raymond, seeks her hand; and Hector is desirous of this
						alliance. The prince is assassinated under circumstances that cause poor
						Brancaleone to be more than suspected. He is thrown into prison, and
						condemned; he escapes, and flies to the mountains, Giacinta being the
						companion of his flight. The most pleasing passages of the work are those
						that describe the wanderings of the lovers, and their residence at the rude
						but hospitable village of Picinisco. The interest is never high-drawn, but
						the purity of the style, and the artless simplicity of the narrative, spread
						a grace over the pages, very unlike the inflated and exaggerated sentiment
						now the fashion in French romances. The village life at Picinisco is a
						picture full of innocence and repose. It is disturbed by the inroads of some
						notorious banditti, the leader of whom is Rocco del Pizzo, brother of the
						unfortunate Constance, who, under the name of Gambalunga, spreads terror
						around; and who declared, in scoff of the guard of hunters among Picinisco,
						that, when they least expected it, he would appear alone among them, and
						carry off the prettiest girl in the village. His success in this enterprise
						is amusingly told:â</p>

               <p>On the days of festival the devout inhabitants descended to the old

                  <pb n="428"/>tain, on the top of which, at the distance of a long musket-shot,
							stands Picinisco. It was the last Sunday of the month, and the children
							of Ser Ilario had betaken themselves betimes to the church, that they
							might be among the first to occupy the sides of the confessional of the
							Canon Crolla, who was the confessor in vogue among these good girls.
							When they reached the sacristy, they saw, leaning against the great
							stone eagle which may still be seen near the great gate of the church, a
							strong youth, who, from his blue cloak, his black nose, and the marks of
							heat in his face, seemed to be a courier from San Donato. When he saw
							them approach, he met them with the usual salutation, <hi rendition="#italics">Gesu e Maria</hi>, and, holding out a letter,
							said, "Thank God! that at last I found some one who can read this
							paper. My master bade me be speedy; and I have been waiting half an hour
							here, and cannot find a soul who can read. I know it is for a certain
							Giannantonio, but I cannot remember his surname."</p>
               <p>Celestina took the letter in her hand, saying to herself, as she tried to
							decipher the writing, "How stupid the people of San Donato are!
							they make a long journey, and do not know to whom they are going. This
							fellow does not look silly; and yet he fancies some one can read among
							these villages! Were it not for the signora, I had never learnt so
							much."</p>
               <p>Her sisters proceeded to the confessional; and she read
							"GianâantonioâArâ,"
							"ArcaroâArcaro. Now I recollect," said the messenger.
							"Well," said the girl, "Giannantonio Arcaro, my friend,
							does not live at Picinisco, but at Aia del Lupo." "And where
							is Aia del Lupo?" "Lookâthere are housesâbehind
							the hill." â "<hi rendition="#italics">Cospetto!</hi>

                  </hi> I thought myself arrived, and I am two miles
							off. How shall I get back to San Donato before dinner? What shall I do?
							my master bade me hurry. My good girl, be charitable, show me the
							shortest way." "That before you, take that roadâwhen you
							get to the fountain, turn to the left, and take the pathâbut it
							would be easier to show you the way than to make you understand
							it;" and, doing what she said, followed by the youth, she reached
							the fountain, and pointed out the lane of a cross-way which he was to
							take. But at this moment his eyes lighted up with a fierce expression,
							which made her eager to return; so she said, "Now I have shown you
							the way, good bye, friend." "No, my dear, I do not understand;
							be so good as to go with me as far as the lane."
							"Reallyâand what do you take me for, good man! I have lost
							time coming so far: go, in God's name! for I must hasten to
							church." "You are right, my pretty angel, but you must
							sometimes do a good turn by a neighbour. I am in a greater hurry,
							perhaps, than you, my dearâComeâcome as far as that. With so
							pretty a face, you must not be hard-hearted. I only ask you to go so
							far." "No, no, good man; I have staid too long; good
							bye." "Well, then, I must begin already to relieve you from
							the trouble of walking;" and, so saying, he took her up in his
							arms, and, in spite of her cries and endeavours to get loose, ran off as
							if he were carrying a child. This was Gambalunga, the bold Gambalunga,
							in person. His comrades, who were waiting for him, hidden on the hill of
							Santa Croce, no sooner saw him than they leapt forth with joyful
							acclamations.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of the villagers, with Brancaleone at their head, brings on the
						catastrophe of the story, which, after many perils to the lovers, and
						romantic incidents, ends happily. The whole presents a pleasing and lively
						picture of the Italiansâtheir vehement passions, which lead them right
						on to their object, accompanied, at the same time, by a sense of natural
						justice and open-hearted frankness, and adorned by unaffected and gentle
						manners. This, too, mixed up with so much of wickedness in the bad
						characters as give darker shades of interest to the tale. We think a
						translation of this romance would be popular in England.</p>
