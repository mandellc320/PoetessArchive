               </ref> well deserves a place, both from the number and
                    elegance of her publications. She was the eldest daughter of Nicholas Turner,
                    esq. a gentleman of fortune, who possessed estates in Surrey and Sussex; a man,
                    it is said, of an improved mind and brilliant conversation. She lost her mother
                    when very young, and was brought up under the care of an aunt, whose ideas of
                    female education were less favourable to mental accomplishments than those of
                    her father. She received, therefore, rather a fashionable than a literary
                    education, and she was left to gratify her taste for books by desultory reading,
                    and almost by stealth. Her genius, indeed, early showed itself in a propensity
                    to poetry; but she was introduced while very young to the gaieties and
                    dissipation of London, and, becoming a wife before she was sixteen, was plunged
                    into the cares of a married life before her fine genius had received all the
                    advantages it might have gained by a culture more regular and persevering. </p>

            <p> Her husband, Mr. Smith, was the younger son of a rich West-Indian merchant, and
                    associated with him in the business. The marriage had been brought about by
                    parents, and did not prove a happy one; it had probably been hastened on her
                    side by the dread of a mother-in-law, as her father was on the point of marrying
                    a second wife. The married pair lived at first in London, in the busy part of
                    the town, but soon after took a house at Southgate. The husband had little
                    application to business; and probably, of the young couple, neither party had
                    much notion of economy. The management of the concern was soon resigned to the
                    father of Mr. Smith, who purchased for them an estate in Hampshire called Lys
                    Farm. Here <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> found her
                    tastes for rural scenery and for elegant society gratified; but building and
                    expensive improvements, joined to an increasing family, soon brought them into
                    difficulties, which were not lessened by the death of her husband's
                    grandfather, to whom Mr. Smith acted as executor, in the discharge of which
                    office a litigation arose with the other branches of the family, which plunged
                    them into lawsuits for life. The vexation attending these perplexities, together
                    with the pecuniary embarrassments she was continually involved in, clouded the
                    serenity of <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref>'s
                    mind, and gave to her writings that bitter and querulous tone of complaint which
                    is discernable in so many of them. </p>

                        Smith</ref>'s genius seems<pb n="iii"/> to have been more to poetry
                    than to any other walk of literature. Her <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Sonnets</hi>
               </title>, which was the first publication she gave to the
                    world, were universally admired. That species of verse, which in this country
                    may be reckoned rather an exotic, had at that time been but little cultivated.
                    For plaintive, tender, and polished sentiment the Sonnet forms a proper vehicle,
                    and <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref>'s success
                    fixed at once her reputation as a poet of no mean class. They were published
                    while her husband was in the King's Bench,<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot">King’s Bench Prison, used mainly for incarcerating debtors

                            occasionally outside) its walls, some of which accommodated
                            families.</note>
               </hi> where she attended him with laudable assiduity,
                    and exerted herself to further his liberation; her feelings upon which event she
                    thus describes in a letter to a friend: "For more than a month I had shared
                    the restraint of my husband amidst scenes of misery, of vice, and even of
                    terror. Two attempts had, since my last residence among them, been made by the
                    prisoners to procure their liberation by blowing up the walls of the house.
                    Throughout the night appointed for this enterprise I remained dressed, watching
                    at the window. After such scenes and such apprehensions, how deliciously
                    soothing to my wearied spirits was the soft, pure air of the summer's
                    morning, breathing over the dewy grass, as, having slept one night upon the
                    road, we passed over the heaths of Surrey!" </p>
            <p> Their difficulties, however, were far from being terminated; and the increasing
                    derangement of Mr. Smith's affairs soon afterwards obliged them to leave
                    England, and they were settled some time in a large gloomy chateau in Normandy,
                    where <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> gave birth to
                    her <milestone unit="signature" n="a 2" rendition="#center"/>

                    affecting pathos, though exceptionable with regard to its moral tendency. </p>
            <p> Returning to England, they occupied for some time an ancient mansion belonging
                    to the Mills' family, at Woodlading, in Sussex, where <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> wrote several of her
                    poems. </p>
            <p> An entire separation afterwards taking place between her and her husband, she
                    removed with most of her children to a small cottage near Chichester, where she
                    wrote her novel of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Emmeline</hi>
               </title> in the
                    course of a few months. She afterwards resided in various places, mostly on the
                    coast of Sussex; for she was particularly fond of the neighbourhood of the sea.
                    The frequent change of scene which, either from necessity or inclination, she
                    experienced, were no doubt favourable to that descriptive talent which forms a
                    striking feature of her genius. Her frequent removals may be traced in her poems
                    and other works. The name of the Arun is consecrated in poetry, and is often
                    mentioned by her: <quote>

            <p> Poets are apt to complain, and often take a pleasure in it; yet they should
                    remember that the pleasure of their readers is only derived from the elegance
                    and harmony with which they do it. The reader is a selfish being, and seeks only
                    his own gratification. But for the language of complaint in plain prose, or the
                    exasperations of personal resentment, he has seldom much sympathy. It is
                    certain, however, that the life of this lady was a very chequered one. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> had a family of twelve
                    children, six only of whom survived her. Her third son lost a limb in the
                    service of his country, and afterwards fell sacrifice to the yellow fever at
                    Barbadoes, whither he had gone to look after the family property. The severest
                    stroke she met with was the loss of a favourite daughter, who died at Bath,
                    where <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> also was for the
                    recovery of her health. The young lady had been married to the Chevalier de
                    Faville, a French emigrant. Her mother is said never entirely to have recovered
                    from this affliction. </p>
            <p> Her last removal was to Stoke, a village in Surrey, endeared to her by her
                    having spent there many years of her childhood; and there she died Oct. 28th,
                    1806, in her 57th year, after a tedious and painful illness. She was a widow at
                    the time of her death, and, being in possession of her own fortune, had a
                    prospect of greater ease in her pecuniary circumstances than she<pb n="vi"/> had
                    for some time enjoyed. Her youngest son, who was advancing in the military
                    career, fell a victim to the pestiferous climate of Surinam before her death,
                    but the news had not reached her. </p>
            <p> Though she was worn by illness, the powers of her mind retained their full
                    vigour, and her last volume of poems, entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Beachy Head</hi>
               </title>, was in the press at the time of her decease;
                    an elegant work, which no ways discredits her former performances. </p>
            <p> She was the author of several publications for children and young people, which
                    are executed with great taste and elegance, and communicate, in a pleasing way,
                    much knowledge of botany and natural history, of which two studies she was very
                    fond. That entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Conversations</hi>
               </title>
                    is interspersed with beautiful little descriptive poems on natural objects. </p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> is most known to
                    readers in general by her novels; yet they seem to have been less the
                    spontaneous offspring of her mind than her poems. She herself represents them as
                    being written to supply money for those emergencies which, from the perplexed
                    state of her affairs, she was often thrown into; but, though not of the first
                    order, they hold a respectable rank among that class of publications. They are
                    written in a style correct and elegant; they show a knowledge of life, and of
                    genteel life; and there is much beauty in the descriptive scenery, which <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</ref> was one of the first to
                    introduce. Descriptions, of whatever beauty, are but little attended to in a
                    novel of high interest, particu- <pb n="vii"/>larly if introduced, as they often
                    are, during a period of anxious suspense for the hero or heroine; but are very
                    properly placed, at judicious intervals, in compositions of which variety rather
                    than deep pathos, and elegance rather than strength, are the characteristics. </p>
            <p> The two most finished novels of <ref target="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs.
                        Smith.</ref> are <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Emmeline</hi>
               </title> and
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Celestina</hi>
               </title>. In the first she
                    is supposed to have drawn her own character, (with what degree of impartiality
                    others must judge,) in that of Mrs. Stafford. </p>
            <p>
               <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Celestina</hi>
               </title> is not inferior to
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Emmeline</hi>
               </title> in the conduct of
                    the piece, and possesses still more beauties of description. The romantic scenes
                    in the south of France are rich and picturesque. The story of Jesse and her
                    lover is interesting, as well as that of Jaquelina. </p>

               </hi> is said to be the most popular of the
                    author's productions. The best drawn character in it is that of a wealthy
                    old lady who keeps all her relations in constant dependence, and will not be
                    persuaded to name her heir. This was written during the war with America; and
                    the author takes occasion, as also in many other of her publications, to show
                    the strain of her politics. </p>
            <p> She also wrote <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Desmond</hi>
               </title>, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Wanderings of Warwick</hi>

                  <hi rendition="#italics">Montalbert</hi>
               </title>, and many others, to the
                    number of thirty-eight volumes. They all show a knowledge of life, and facility
                    of execution, without having any very strong features, or particularly aiming to
                    illustrate any moral truth. The situations and the scenery are often<pb n="viii"/> romantic; the characters and the conversations are from common life. </p>
            <p> Her later publications would have been more pleasing, if the author, in the
                    exertions of fancy, could have forgotten herself; but the asperity of invective
                    and the querulousness of complaint too frequently cloud the happier exertions of
                    her imagination. </p>
