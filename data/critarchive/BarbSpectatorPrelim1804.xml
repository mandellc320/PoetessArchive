               generation passeth away and another cometh. Whoever has lived long enough to compare
               one race of men with that which has preceded it, will have observed a change, not
               only in the tastes and habitudes of common life, but in the fashion of their studies,
               and their course of general reading. Books influence manners; and manners, in return,
               influence the taste for books.</p>
            <p> Books make a silent and gradual, but a sure change in our ideas and opinions; and as
               new authors are continually taking possession of the public mind, and old ones
               falling into disuse, new associations insensibly take place, and shed their influence

               would put <ref target="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</ref> into the hands of
               his child, and the parent of the present day would give him <ref

               same general sentiments of piety and benevolence: yet their offspring will be pupils
               of a different school, and their moral ideas will have some shades of difference.
               This new infusion of taste and moral sentiment acts in its turn upon the relish for
               books; and thus the fame of writers is exposed to continual fluctuation. Nor does
               this remark apply only to those ephemeral publications which, either from the nature
               of the subject or the mediocrity of its execution, live their day, and are then
               buried in oblivion; but to books that have been the favourites of the public, and
               ‘the very glass by which its noble youth did dress themselves.'<note>

               the taste of the public into a different channel. It is true, indeed, that a work of
               the first excellence cannot perish. It will continue to be respected as a classic:
               but it will <pb n="iii"/> no longer be the book which everyone who reads is expected
               to be acquainted with, to which allusions are often made, and readily understood in
               conversation; it loses the precious privilege of occupying the minds of youth: in
               short, it is withdrawn from the parlour-window, and laid upon the shelf in honourable
               repose. It ceases to be current coin, but is preserved like a medal in the cabinets
               of the curious.</p>
            <p> This revolution the <title>Spectators</title>, with the other sets of papers by the
               same hands, appear to the Editor to have undergone. When those were young who now are
               old, no books were so popular, particularly with the female sex. They were the
               favourite volumes in a young lady's library; and probably the very first that, after
               the <title>Bible</title>, she would have thought of purchasing. <ref
                  target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</ref> and the other

                  </title> IV.iii.52, altered. </note> and every little circumstance related of them
               remained indelibly engraven on our memories. From the papers of <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> we imbibed our first relish for
               wit; from his criticisms we formed our first standard of taste; and from his
               delineations we drew our first ideas of manners. It <lb/><fw type="sig">a 2</fw>
               <pb n="iv"/> requires little attention to be convinced that this is now far from
               being the case. It is not difficult to meet with those among the rising generation
               who have only seen here and there an occasional paper of a publication once so
               generally diffused; and it now and then happens that a story from the
                  <title>Tatler</title> is produced as new, in polite company, without detection.
               Various causes have contributed to this change. When these periodical papers were
               first published, the plan itself was new. It has since been adopted by various
               writers with more or less success, till the frame-work is worn out, or, if the reader
               please, till the canvas of the panorama is become threadbare. Style has also been
               purified and refined. Criticism has become more profound. Essay-writing has been
               largely cultivated. Moral sentiments of weight and importance have become trite from
               frequent repetition. The talent also of composition is more common than it was a
               century ago; and many things which were then first said have since been better said.
               Add to this, that much of the wit and lively satire of these papers has been employed
               on subjects of a temporary nature, and has consequently lost much of its salt and
               pungency. We are no longer interested in the <pb n="v"/> contest between the opera
               and the puppet-show. We can only guess how much of truth and how much of invention is
               contained in the account of the Mohawks; and we are less struck with the whimsical
               effect of party-patching, when the mode itself is forgotten amidst newer inventions
               of capricious ornament, and more modern exhibitions of fashionable folly.</p>
            <p> It is also to be considered, that the more efficacious these pieces have been, and
               no doubt they have had considerable effect, in refining the taste and correcting the
               manners of society, the sooner will they be thrown by as antiquated or useless. Thus,
               the very success of a book may hasten the period of its being forgotten; and the
               completion of an author's purpose may turn out to be the ruin of his fame. <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> was himself aware of this cause
               of a diminution of popularity, and says, in one of his essays, that those papers
               which attack the follies of the day, will, in process of time, become like old plate;
               the weight will remain, but the fashion will be lost. </p>
            <p> It must however be acknowledged, that a great part of these compositions do by no
               means stand upon so high a ground of merit as to have any strong claim upon the
               notice of <lb/><fw type="sig">a 3</fw>
               <pb n="vi"/> the present age. In the <title>Tatler</title>s there is a great deal of
               absolute trifling; and the <title>Spectator</title>s themselves, though the best of
               the several sets, are very unequally written,—as indeed might be expected from the
               various hands engaged in the work. <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard"
                  >Steele</ref> was an entertaining rather than a fine writer; and none of his
               coadjutors (the immortal <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> alone
               excepted) would now be thought much above the common run of essay-writers in a
               newspaper or a magazine. Many inaccuracies and even vulgarisms blemish the pages of
                  <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref>, which an author of less
               celebrity would now avoid. We are grown more accurate in our definitions, more
               discriminating in our investigations, more pure in our diction, more fastidious in
               the ornaments of style; we possess standards of excellence of every kind to refer to,
               books multiply on our hands, and we willingly consign to oblivion a portion of the
               old, to make room for the increasing demands of the new.</p>
            <p> This being the case, it has been thought that a <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >Selection</hi> from the <hi rendition="#italics">

               spirit and excellence of these works chiefly resides, might be no unacceptable
               present to the world in general, and par- <pb n="vii"/> ticularly to <hi
                  rendition="#italics">young people</hi> of both sexes, who may not happen to
               possess the originals, and who, if they did, would want a guide, in so miscellaneous
               a work, to direct them to what is best worth their notice. Let it not be imagined
               that such a Selection is presumptuously intended to supersede the original volumes;
               they must always find their place in a well-furnished library: but the generality of
               readers, of whose various occupations the cultivation of literature makes only a
               part, (and of this class are nearly all women, and most men who are not devoted to
               professional studies,) may perhaps be well content to have some of the most beautiful
               compositions in our language presented to them, without being obliged to lose their
               own time in separating them from a mass of uninteresting matter. The French are very
               fond of extracting what they call <hi rendition="#italics">l'esprit d'un auteur</hi>,
               which may be translated <hi rendition="#italics">the essence of a writer</hi>. In
               this, which may be compared to the essential oils of plants, resides the genuine and
               distinguishing flavour of an author's wit; but it commonly bears a very small
               proportion to his bulk. Whole libraries might by this process be distilled down to a
               few pocket volumes; as a single phial of <hi rendition="#italics">attar</hi> of roses
               contains <lb/><fw type="sig">a 4</fw>
               <pb n="viii"/> the precious product of many acres. Time is an admirable chymist in
               this way. We are apt to lament the waste he has made among the productions of antient
               genius: but it is probable, if we had an opportunity of inspecting them, we should
               find that, in reality, nearly all are preserved to us that are most worth
               preservation; and that what has perished is chiefly made up of the residuum of
               science, and the caput mortuum of literature. It is true, indeed, that there is a
               light in which papers that describe the manners and little incidents of the day, rise
               in value as their contents become more obsolete. With what curiosity should we peruse
               a Roman newspaper, or a critique upon <ref target="people.html#Roscius"
               >Roscius</ref>, or a <hi rendition="#italics">conversatione</hi> at the toilette of

                  <title>Spectator</title>s are already a great source of information, and five
               hundred years hence will be invaluable; though it must be observed, some discernment
               is necessary to separate the playful exaggerations of humour from the real facts on
               which they are grounded.</p>

               called the <title>Examiner</title>, conducted with great virulence on the other side.
               The <title>Tatler</title> was a kind of newspaper as well as an essay: it was
               published three times a week, and sold, there being then no stamp-duty, at the low

            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> kept himself concealed, and was
               only suspected of being one of the authors till its appearance in volumes. This
               publication gave as it were the dawn and promise of its successor, the <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Spectator</hi>
               </title>; and indeed there are papers in it equal in humour to any of the latter: as
               the account of the freezing of words in Nova Zembla, the Court of Honour, and some
               others: but, in general, the wit is local and temporary, the style negligent; and
               even the strain of the graver papers rather gives the idea of a wit who lashes the
               town, than an elegant moralist who instructs the world. The <title>Tatler</title>
               abounds in personalities; to some of these the clue cannot now be reco- <pb n="xi"/>
               vered, and of others the interest has long since been lost. Party spirit also, at the
               time these papers were published, ran very high; the whigs and tories were so nearly
               balanced that they maintained for some time an equal struggle, which at length ended
               in the complete defeat of the whigs, the disgrace of the <ref

               responsibility of a paper, of which he was now well known to be the editor, and of
               being personally threatened, as he often was, for the liberties he took with living
               characters, he suddenly dropped the work on January 2, 1710. It revived in two
               months' time, under better auspices and with new associates, and bore the title of
               the <title>

               completely alienated from his old friends; but his defection was more than
               compensated by the regular assistance of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
                  >Addison</ref>. The new plan was better concerted, the authors felt their
               strength, they had experienced how popular this way of writing was capable of
               becoming, and they determined to <pb n="xii"/> keep it free from personal satire and
               party politics. This in general they did, and it was laid on the queen's table at
               breakfast. It is not difficult, however, for a skilful reader to discern in the
               general turn of sentiment the political complexion of the writers. The town soon
               found out to whom they were obliged for their entertainment; and an elegant
               compliment was paid to the <title>Spectator</title> in the following epigram: <quote>

            <p> To estimate the good which was done by this publication, we should consider the
               state of society at the time it was written. Party spirit was high and bitter, the
               manners of the wits and fashionable young men were still tinctured with the
               licentiousness of the court <pb n="xiii"/> of <ref
                  target="people.html#CharlesIIKingofEngland">Charles II</ref>., mixed with the
               propensity to disorderly outrages and savage frolics incident to a people who were
               still amused by the Bear Garden<note>The Bear Garden was a sort of amphitheatre
                  dedicated to bull-baiting, bear-baiting, prize-fighting, and similar sports. It
                  was attended by butchers, drovers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; also by people of the highest
                  fashion, for whom there were seats set apart, ornamented with old tapestry
                  hangings, the price of which was half-a-crown. Its neighbourhood was notorious for
                  pick-pockets and infamous women. May Fair, another place of disorderly resort, was
                  abolished in 1709 [<ref target="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</ref>'s note].
               </note>, and who had not yet been taught to bend under the yoke of a strict police.
               The stage was in its meridian of genius and fashion, but disgraced by rant and
               grossness, which offended the sober and excluded the strict. Men lived much in clubs,
               and of course drinking was common. There was more separation than at present between
               the different classes of society; and each was more strongly marked with the
               peculiarities of his profession. There were learned and there were elegant women; but
               manners had not received a general polish, nor had women the advantage of a general
               cultivation. Genius had already attained its perfection, but the reign of taste may

               unknown. Of all these <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> was the
               head of gold. His merit is indeed so superior to that of his associates, that their
               labours probably live to this day only by being grafted on his fame. Many of their
               papers are pleasing and instructive: yet, if by any accident they were destroyed,
               their loss would scarcely be felt amongst the various treasures of English
               literature; whereas the loss of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>
               could not elsewhere be supplied, and would make a chasm not in the number only, but
               in the species of our fine writers.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> was one of a cluster of men of
               genius, who, flourishing at a time when the taste of the nation was forming itself,
               became in their different walks the standards of literary excellence. His peculiar
               portion was delicate humour, taste, and richness of imagination: these were all
               enlisted on the side of virtue <pb n="xv"/> and good manners. In these periodical
               papers he assumed the title of Censor; and no one was better qualified for so
               delicate and useful an office. Decency and sobriety of behaviour are every where
               inculcated: every offensive singularity, every outrage of the licentious upon the
               sober and defenceless part of society, is held up to reprobation: marriage, the
               constant butt of the wits and jest of the stage, is treated with just respect, and
               its duties enforced. <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> says of
               himself, that as <ref target="people.html#Socrates">Socrates</ref> made it his boast,
               that he had drawn down philosophy from the gods to dwell among men, so he shall be
               satisfied to have it said of him, that he had brought her from schools and colleges
               to the tea-table and the dressing-room. His talents were well adapted for an
               undertaking of this sort. His excellence lay not so much in the depth or extent of
               his ideas, as in his pleasing manner of communicating them; in the splendour he
               diffused over a serious—in the grace with which he touched a lighter subject. <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> had a large portion of the honey
               of <ref target="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</ref>: nourished like him with
               the purest flower of classical literature, he possessed a like vivid fancy; a similar
               fulness and richness of style. <pb n="xvi"/> But he also possessed the attic salt of
                  <ref target="people.html#Apuleius">Lucian</ref>: the manner of this author is so

               knowledge of <ref target="people.html#Menippus">the Greek author</ref>, might easily
               be induced to believe the dialogue was really translated from that elegant
               satirist.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> had a wonderful talent in
               working up a hint, and producing a most beautiful fancy-piece from a neglected
               fragment, a slight outline, or an obscure tradition. Of this, his account of the
               nation of the Amazons, the Loves of Shalum and Hilpah, and the History of the Lovers'
               Leap, may be given as instances. Even where the substance is borrowed, as in some of
               the Eastern tales which he has condescended to illustrate; who is not struck with
               their different effect as clothed in his style, and as we read them in the bald
               translation of the Arabian Tales? Whatever he touches he turns to gold. If we compare
               him with the most distinguished of his contemporaries (for to the most distinguished
               alone can he be compared), we shall find he has more ease and simplicity than <ref
                  target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>, whose wit is not always free from
               affectation, and whose satire is frequently splenetic, sometimes malignant. <ref
                  target="people.html#ArbuthnotJohn">Arbuthnot</ref> and <ref
                  target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref> had as much wit, per- <pb n="xvii"
               /> haps a freer vein of humour; but <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan"
                  >Swift</ref> could not, like <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
               >Addison</ref>, ally it to grace and soften it with amenity. The satire of <ref
                  target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref> is caustic and contemptuous; that
               of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> is so sheathed in urbanity,
               that it scarcely offends those whom it chastises.</p>
            <p> To be convinced of this we need only turn our thoughts to the different effect
               produced by the strictures of each upon the female sex. Both are perhaps in reality
               equally severe, and by their pleasantries betray a contempt for a sex they probably
               considered in a very inferior light: yet such is the charm of manner, that the
                  <title>Spectator</title> has ever been the favourite of the toilette and the
               dressing-room; while it requires no common strength of mind in a lady, to overcome
               the disgust excited by the supercilious harshness of <ref
                  target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">the Irish Dean</ref>, and to profit by lessons
               delivered with so much roughness. When <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
                  >Addison</ref> rallies, you see a satyr peeping over the shoulder of the Graces.
               His wit is refined; it is of a kind that requires and exercises penetration in his
               reader, who is to catch his meaning from the side views that are dexterously
               presented to him; for the author never laughs himself. The style of <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> is pure and clear; rather diffuse
               than <lb/>

               <pb n="xviii"/> concentrated, and ornamented to the highest degree consistent with
               good taste. But this ornament consists in the splendour of imagery, not in the
               ordonnance of words; his readers will seek in vain for those sonorous cadences with
               which the public ear has been familiarised since the writings of <ref
                  target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>. They will find no stately
               magnificence of phrase, no triads of sentences artfully balanced, so as to form a
               sweep of harmony at the close of a period. His words are genuine English: he deals
               little in inversions, and often allows himself to conclude negligently with a trivial
               word. The fastidious ear may occasionally be offended with some colloquial phrases,
               and some expressions which would not now, perhaps, be deemed perfectly accurate, the
               remains of barbarisms which he more than any one had laboured to banish from good
               writing; but the best judges have doubted, whether our language has not lost more
               than it has gained since his time. An idiomatic style gives a truth and spirit to a
               composition, that is but ill compensated by an elaborate pomp, which sets written
               composition at too great a distance from speech, for which it is only the substitute.
               There is perhaps a little too much of <pb n="xix"/> what the French call <hi

               he conveys his advice to the female part of his readers: but it was the fashion of

               sly ridicule. <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, in his surly way,

               by his exquisite natural taste, as by his familiar acquaintance with the Greek and
               Roman classics, and the laws of composition; we may add also, by his serious and
               religious turn of mind, a circumstance of no small moment in relishing a poem the
               basis of which is laid in scriptural mythology. This admirable poem, which is now the
               boast of every Englishman, was at that time but little noticed. Not that <ref

               long enough before the public to attract the notice of judges: but there had been no
               large edition before his time, and many circumstances had contributed to prevent its
               soon becoming a popular work. <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</ref>'s
               political character was for some time obnoxious; his style had many little rough- <pb
                  n="xxi"/> nesses, and many scholastic terms not easily understood. His poem was in
               blank verse, which was then a novelty to the English reader, as was also the nature
               of the poem itself; for we had no regular epic, and the common reader was not, as
               now, familiarized, through the medium of good translations, with <ref

               and elegant criticism, the essayist goes on to illustrate the beauties of his author.
               The many brilliant passages that are quoted, and brought into parallel with
               corresponding ones in the antient poets, chequer the page with a pleasing variety,
               and, by familiarizing the reader with the style of <ref

               reception of the entire poem. Such a critique has certainly less in it that suits the
               present day, and therefore the editor was long in doubt whether to admit these papers
               in the present Selection. They will however be found useful to young persons in
               laying a basis of just taste, and older ones might have regretted the omission of
               what they have been accustomed to admire. A reader of the present day will <lb/><fw

            <p> Several papers are devoted to theatrical entertainments. Such was then the
               licentiousness of the playhouse, that the austere moralists condemned it altogether.
                  <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> did better; for he undertook
               to reform it; and <pb n="xxiii"/> no doubt it is owing to the castigation which he
               and other writers of taste and virtue have bestowed upon it, that it is at present
               tolerably free from gross indecency, rant, and profaneness. It was then common for
               ladies of character to go in a mask the first night of a new play, as they <hi
                  rendition="#italics">expected </hi>to be put out of countenance. <ref
                  target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref> had a great share in this
               reformation, as well by his own comedies as by his strictures on those of others.</p>
            <p> Not content with the incidental and indirect service done to virtue and religion in
               the general strain of his writings, the Saturday papers through many of the volumes
               are devoted by <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> expressly to
               that purpose. The sentiments of rational and liberal devotion which breathe through
               them, are blended with the speculations of philosophy and the paintings of a fine
               imagination. His religious affections break forth at a fine sun-set, the view of the
               starry heavens, and other circumstances proper to impress a mind of feeling. Of these
               a portion are presented to the reader; perhaps not so many as, upon a vague
               recollection, he will imagine might have been collected: but the truth is, we abound
               so much in excellent <lb/><fw type="sig">b 4</fw>
               <pb n="xxiv"/> discourses of this nature, that many of them would not now appear to
               be marked with that originality which is meant to form the basis of this Selection.
               In one particular, we must reluctantly confess, <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> was <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >not</hi> liberal. He had no enlarged ideas of religious toleration. He treats
               Freethinkers, whom he often attacks, with a contempt and insult by no means
               consistent with either the philosophy or the urbanity of his character: nay, he gives
               broad hints that the civil magistrate would be well employed in hunting these vermin,
               as he calls them, out of society; and talks, half in jest half in earnest, of
               "blowing an atheist out of the mouth of a cannon." But <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> was, and was accustomed to call
               himself, a tory in religion, though a whig in politics.</p>
            <p> The next class may be called his Fancy Pieces, as the <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <title>Vision of Mirzah</title>, the <title>Mountain of Miseries</title>,
                     <title>Marathon and Yaratilda</title>
               </hi>. These are almost all such as none but himself could write. The flower of the
               most elegant imagination, the visions of a poetical fancy, are blended sometimes with
               sentiment, sometimes with wit and gaiety, and often are illustrative of some sublime
               moral truth. In this kind of <pb n="xxv"/> writing, particularly pleasing to young
               minds, <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> has been often imitated,
               but perhaps never equalled.</p>
            <p> In the pictures of life and delineation of manners, which make up a large part of
               the work, the hand of a master is not less apparent. The character of the Spectator
               himself is well conceived and faithfully kept up; and that of <ref
                  target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</ref> is exquisitely
               drawn. It is however remarkable, that his character, as delineated in the course of
               the work, is very different from the sketch of it given in the account of the club
               with which the first volume of the <title>Spectator</title> opens: but that paper is
               not <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>'s, and it should seem as if
               the authors had intended to make more use of those characters than they afterwards
               found it convenient to do; for the greater part of them come but little into play,
               and are no way essential to the conduct of the work. <ref
                  target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</ref>, in the
               account given of him in the first paper, is said to have been in his youth a man of
               the town, a fine gentleman, to have supped with wits, blustered in coffee-houses, and
               fought duels. <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>'s <ref
                  target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger</ref> is nothing of all this. He
               is an honest country gentleman, ignorant of the town <pb n="xxvi"/> and the ways of
               it, with a moderate share of sense, very little information, and a large portion of
               what many would call salutary prejudices. By the first paper we are prepared to
               expect a man whose singularities proceed from good sense and an original cast of
               thought; a kind of humourist, not unlike the elder Shandy;<note>Referring to <ref

                     <title>Tristram Shandy</title>
                  </hi>.</note> but the singularities of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
                  >Addison</ref>'s <ref target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger</ref>
               proceed from rusticity, and the prejudices of a confined education, operating indeed
               upon a most benevolent and friendly heart. His character is set in a new light, in a
               paper written by <ref target="people.html#AikinJohn">Dr. Aikin</ref>, in the
                  <title>Monthly Magazine</title> for February 1800.<note>
                  <title>"On the Humour of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> and

                  </title> 9.1 (February 1, 1800): 1-3.</note>It is there observed, that this
               character, though meant to be a favourite, is also meant as a vehicle of satire upon
               the character of the country gentleman, which <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
                  >Addison</ref> has more openly held up to ridicule in the country squire of his
                  <title>Freeholder</title>: they are extremely different with regard to the
               amiableness of their characters, but they have the same national and party
               prejudices, and are both intended to exhibit inferiority to the more cultured
               inhabitant of the town, and to fasten a ridicule upon the tory, which at that time
               was the country party. In <ref target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de
                  Coverley</ref>, however, this design is subservient to that of <pb n="xxvii"/>
               drawing an amiable and worthy character. <ref target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley"
                  >Sir Roger</ref>'s benevolence, hospitality, piety, and honest open cheerfulness,
               win our warmest affections; and if we often smile at, we always love him. The
               reserved, sagacious, and thoughtful character of the <title>Spectator</title>
               contrasts very well with the simplicity and turn for active sports of the knight.
               With regard to his passion for the widow, and the effect it is said to have had upon
               him, it may be doubted whether it forms a natural feature in a character like his.
               Minds that expand themselves in feelings of cheerful good will, and acts of general
               benevolence, and are at the same time destitute of those nicer discriminations of
               taste that influence particular predilections, are perhaps not very likely to have
               the colour of their whole lives affected by a hopeless passion. But <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> has had little to do with that
               part of his character. Opposed to <ref target="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir
                  Roger</ref> is Sir Andrew Freeport, a London merchant. Trade, though rising fast,
               or rather already risen into consequence, was despised by the country gentry. <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> has frequently taken occasion to
               set the trading part of the community, who were nearly all whigs, in a respectable
               light, and to show the connection of commerce with science and liberal <pb n="xxviii"
               /> principles. Many other characters, in the course of the work, are delineated with
               great spirit and humour; and the <title>Spectator</title>s are by this alone
               advantageously distinguished from all the periodical papers which have succeeded
               them.</p>
            <p> Thus various are the merits of an author, whose fame can only perish with the
               language in which he wrote. As a critic, it is not profound learning or metaphysical
               subtlety, but exquisite taste; as a philosopher, it is not deep research, but the
               happy art of unfolding an idea, and placing it in the most attractive light; as a
               moralist, it is not that energy which rouses and carries away the soul in the vortex
               of its own enthusiasm; nor the novelty of system, resulting from bold original ideas,
               but an eloquence urbane, persuasive, and temperate, the alliance of the heart with
               the imagination, which distinguishes the page of <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>. In strokes of delicate humour
               and refined wit he is inexhaustible; but he has given us no instance of the pathetic,
               except in his story of Theodosius and Constantia.</p>
            <p> To the other authors of these periodical papers we are indebted for many pleasing
               essays. <ref target="people.html#PearceZachary">Pierce</ref>, bishop of Rochester,
               has some ingenious papers of the serious kind. The un- <pb n="xxix"/> fortunate <ref
                  target="people.html#BudgellEustace">Budgell</ref>, the relation of <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref>, wrote many papers: his style
               often comes so near that of his friend and master as to do him great honour, were it
               not said that <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> added so many
               touches of his own as to make <ref target="people.html#BudgellEustace"
               >Budgell</ref>'s property in them very doubtful. He uses the signature of X. <ref
                  target="people.html#TickellThomas">Tickell</ref>, who in many of his works
               presented a fainter reflexion of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph"
                  >Addison</ref>, was one of the set; but his papers have no mark. <ref
                  target="people.html#ParnellThomas">Parnell</ref> wrote the vision of the Grotto of
               Grief, and the Palace of Vanity. Mr. <ref target="people.html#ByromJohn">Byrom</ref>
               wrote the popular piece, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">My time, O ye Muses</hi>
               </title>, and some papers on dreaming. Most of the interesting stories are <ref
                  target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref>'s; and the greater part of those
               papers that paint the manners of the town. <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard"
                  >Steele</ref> had a flowing pen, but his style is negligent; and though he has
               endeavoured to serve the cause of virtue, particularly in his strictures on duelling,
               then very common, and gaming, yet his morals have neither the dignity nor the purity
               of those of his coadjutor. 'The snuffers (says <ref
                  target="people.html#LatimerBishop">bishop Latimer</ref>) should be of pure gold.'
               Such was not <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref>, whose weaknesses
               and faults drew upon him the reprehension of his own better judgment. He was a
               character vibrating between virtue and vice, but he <pb n="xxx"/> wanted not moral
               feeling. He is said to have opposed duelling, in consequence of the deep remorse he
               felt from the fatal termination of a duel which he himself fought in early life with
               a brother officer. <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref> tells a story
               with humour, but without its more delicate touches; and his style is marked by little
               flippancies, and a certain air of the town. His signature is T, and sometimes R.

            <p> The <title>Spectator</title> continued from 1710 to 1714; that is, during the last
               years of <ref target="people.html#AnneQueenofGreatBritain">Queen Anne</ref> to the
               beginning of the reign of <ref target="people.html#ageorgeIKingofGreatBritain">George
                  the First</ref>: and during a time when all the other periodical publications were
               party papers, and so bitter a spirit of animosity divided almost every company, it
               was no small advantage that one paper appeared every morning the tendency of which
               was of an opposite nature, and that presented subjects for conversation which men
               might canvass without passion, and on which <lb/><fw type="sig">2</fw>
               <pb n="xxxi"/> they might differ without resentment. Three thousand of them were sold
               daily soon after the commencement of the publication; afterwards, it is said, twenty
               thousand; and it may rebuke our rage for typographical luxury to be told, that the
               immortal productions of <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> were
               first given to the public on a half-sheet of very coarse paper, and, before the
               imposition of a stamp, for the price of one penny.</p>
            <p> The <title>Guardian</title>s may be considered as a kind of sequel to the
                  <title>Spectator</title>s. They were in two volumes. The strain of them is
               somewhat less sprightly; but they contain many excellent papers, and among them
               several by <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>. The
                  <title>Guardian</title> was published in the year 1713, between the seventh and
               eighth volumes of the <title>Spectator</title>. For what reason the authors dropped,
               changed, and resumed their title in so short a space, cannot now be known. The
                  <title>Guardian</title> has, like the <title>Spectator</title>, a set of
               characters as a frame to the work, my Lady Lizard and her sons and daughters, to whom
               Nestor Ironside is the Guardian; but they are drawn with less spirit than those of
               the club in the <title>Spectator</title>, and both have the fault of not being
               necessary to the conduct of the work. It is justly observed by Dr. <ref
                  target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Johnson</ref>, that the grave <pb n="xxxii"/>
               character of a Guardian, and a guardian to young ladies, is unfavourable to the

               just criticisms on a species of poetry now almost obsolete, but at one period so much
               in fashion, that there was hardly a poet who did not try his hand at it; till at
               length it became insipid by the triteness of the sentiment, and the servile use of
               the heathen mythology. The lovers of Italian poetry will by no means be satisfied to
               see the beautiful poems of Aminta and Pastor Fido<note>

               English readers had, at that time, little relish for the belles lettres of other
               nations. The Italian language was perhaps less cultivated than in the preceding
               century. <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> himself had a
               sufficient portion of national prejudice, as appears whenever the French writers are
               incidentally mentioned. The concluding allegory on pastoral poetry exhibits much
               elegant fancy, along with a strange con- <pb n="xxxiii"/> fusion in the application
               of it to different writers, and the periods in which they flourished. The critique on
                  <ref target="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</ref>'s Pastorals by that author
               himself, is remarkable for the delicacy and artful irony which imposed on the editor
               of the paper, and secured its insertion, though it was, in fact, a concealed ridicule
               on <ref target="people.html#PhilipsAmbrose">Phillips</ref>, whose pastorals it had
               been the aim of the former papers to extol.</p>
            <p> The <title>Freeholder</title> was a direct party paper, written by <ref
                  target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> alone, on the side of Government,
               immediately after the rebellion of 1715, when perhaps one half of the nation were
               Jacobites in their hearts. It can of course supply little matter for a selection of
               this kind: yet a few papers are given, both as they possess genuine humour, and
               because, as <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> himself remarks,
               future readers may see in them the complexion of the times in which they were
               written. His country squire is drawn with great humour and much effect, as the
               representative of a set of men who were then almost all partisans against the court,
               if not favourers of the Stuart family.</p>
