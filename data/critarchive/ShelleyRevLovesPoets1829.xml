               <hi rendition="#largest">T</hi>HE Loves of the Poets! that we may understand why the
               conjunction of ideas represented by these words, presents the most resplendent image
               of beauty, grace, and happiness, that the human mind can well conceive, let us
               analyze them, and learn what Love, and what a Poet is.</p>
            <p>There is much in the world afforded by nature and contrived by man, to yield
               satisfaction and enjoyment to our senses and our physical wants. In this northern
               clime the rich engross much of these. Carriages, horses, palaces with all their
               appendages, costly dress, and luxurious tables. The poor, (<hi rendition="#italics"
                  >i.e.</hi> the unopulent, not the absolutely poor, those shut out from nature's
               table, the starving and miserable), have a counterbalance in a keener sense of the
               delights of leisure—they bring appetite instead of fastidious taste to season their
               plain viands, repose after labour, instead of downy beds, and silken hangings. With
               the omission of the necessitous and sick, our physical nature is replete with
               agreeable sensations; and yet how many ministered to, even to superfluity, are
               unhappy.</p>
            <p>The mind requires more contribution than even our corporeal frame; ennui is the
               offspring of plenty and comfort; and while we contrive to shut out the evil elements,
               listlessness and weariness pervade the soul and pall every enjoyment. If the poor
               suffer less from this annoyance, it is not because they receive more pleasure; but
               because care, anxiety, or labour, occupy them; the rich also invent employments;
               books, operas, concerts, hunting, shooting, balls, picture-dealing, building,
               planting, travelling, fanciful changes of dress, and gambling. Yet these suffice not,
               nor professions, trades, nor ambition, to afford pleasure, though they waste the
               time; even the pursuits of wisdom, and the discoveries of science, engrossing as they
               are, and often delightful, are inefficient to take the sting from life, changing its
               burthen to gladness: this miracle is left for the affections; and the best form of
               affection, from the excess of its sympathy, is Love.</p>
            <p>Who can feel satiety or sorrow when he loves?—"Love," Plato says, "showers benignity
               upon the world; before his presence, all harsh passions flee and perish. He is the
               author of all soft affections, the destroyer of all ungentle thoughts, possessed by
               the fortunate, and desired by the unhappy, therefore unhappy, because they possess
               him not; he is the father of grace and delicacy, and gentleness and delight and
               persuasion, and desire; the cherisher of all that is good, the abolisher of all<pb

               labour and in fear, in desire and in reason; the ornament and governor of all things
               human and divine; the best, the loveliest."<note>

            <p>"Love," Shelley writes, "is that powerful attraction towards all we conceive, or
               fear, or hope beyond ourselves, when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an
               inefficient void, and seek to awaken in all things that are, a community with what we
               experience within ourselves. The meeting with an understanding capable of clearly
               estimating our own, an imagination which should enter into, and seize upon the subtle
               and delicate peculiarities we have delighted to cherish and unfold in secret, with a
               frame whose nerves, like the chords of two exquisite lyres strung to the
               accompaniment of one delightful voice, vibrate with the vibrations of our own; this
               is the unattainable point to which Love tends; and to attain which, it urges forth
               the powers of man to arrest the faintest shadow of that, without the possession of
               which there is no rest or respite to the heart over which it rules."<note>Essay on

            </p>
            <p>If so imperious, intense and pervading, be the spirit of Love, most powerful in the
               best and most delicate natures, how earnestly must women, whose being is formed for
               tenderness and sympathy, desire to know among whom in the harder, harsher sex this
               feeling exists in its greatest purity and force. And is not a poet an incarnation of
               the very essence of Love?</p>
            <p>What is a Poet? Is he not that which wakens melody in the silent chords of the human
               heart? A light which arrays in splendor things and thoughts which else were dim in
               the shadow of their own insignificance. His soul is like one of the pools in the Ilex
               woods of the Maremma,<note>Maremma is a coastal area of Tuscany in Italy. The ilex
                  genus of evergreen grow plentifully in the Mediterranean climate of that

               and mellows their tints, making a little world within itself, the copy of the outer
               one; but more entire, more faultless. But above all, a poet's soul is Love; the
               desire of sympathy is the breath that inspires his lay, while he lavishes on the
               sentiment and its object, his whole treasure-house of resplendent imagery, burning
               emotion, and ardent enthusiasm. He is the mirror of nature, reflecting her back ten
               thousand times more lovely; what then must not his power be, when he adds beauty to
               the most perfect thing in nature—even Love.</p>

               Another scrap in the same volume may serve as a comment. The few lines she has
               written on "Sentiment" sufficiently show why she depreciates the breathing sentiment
               of love, which is a poet's treasure and his gift.</p>
            <p>Let us instead of refuting an opinion which this lady may already have discarded as
               false, turn to the pages of the book before us, which propose to give us the history
               of the Loves of the Poets, of modern poets that is, for with many declarations of
               ignorance, yet with no little presumption, the fair authoress sweeps out of her list
               the loves of the classic authors; she shall have her way, however, and with her we
               will confine ourselves to the poets of modern Europe.</p>
            <p>This work is the production of <ref target="people.html#JamesonAnna">the authoress of
                  the "<title>Diary of an Ennuyée</title>,"</ref> a book we have heard described as
               the offspring of a singular union of a light head and a heavy heart—whose defect is
               to have made reality and fiction, who are brother and sister, and who may not
               therefore too closely unite, marry, and produce an offspring which is neither true
               nor false. Yet notwithstanding this defect, which disturbs and confuses the reader
               throughout, it is an interesting, clever, and graceful work.</p>
            <p>The book dwells somewhat on the Troubadours, and then commences with the early
               Italian poets. So much has been said concerning <ref

               hearts were the abode of Love, the realm over which sweet womanhood reigned and

               <p>Leonora then was not unworthy of her illustrious conquest, either in person,
                  heart, or mind. To be summoned daily into the presence of a princess thus
                  beautiful and amiable, to read aloud his verses to her, to hear his own praises
                  from her lips, to bask in her approving smiles, to associate with her in
                  retirement, to behold her in all the graceful simplicity of her familiar life, was
                  a dangerous situation for <ref target="people.html#TassoTorquato">Tasso</ref>, and
                  surely not less so for Leonora herself. That she was aware of his admiration, and
                  perfectly understood his sentiments, and that a mysterious intelligence existed
                  between them, consistent with the utmost reverence on his part, and the most
                  perfect delicacy and dignity on hers, is apparent from the meaning and tendency of
                  innumerable passages scattered through his minor poems, too significant in their
                  application to be mistaken. Though that application be not avowed, and even
                  disguised, the very disguise, when once detected, points to the object. Leonora
                  knew, as well as her lover, that a princess "was no love-mate for a
                     bard."<note>Byron, "The Lament of Tasso" stanza V, line 13, slightly altered.
                  </note>She knew far better than her lover—until <hi rendition="#italics">he</hi>
                  too had been taught by wretched experience—the haughty and implacable temper of
                  her brother Alphonso, who was never known to brook an injury or forgive an
                  offender. She must have remembered too well the twelve years imprisonment and the
                  narrow escape from death, of her unfortunate mother, for a less cause. She was of
                  a timid reserved nature, increased by the extreme delicacy of her constitution.
                  Her hand had been frequently sought by princes and nobles, whom she had uniformly
                  rejected, at the risk of displeasing her brother; and the eyes of a jealous court
                  were upon her. <ref target="people.html#TassoTorquato">Tasso</ref>, on the other
                  hand, was imprudent, hot-headed, fearless, and ardently attached. For both their
                  sakes it was necessary for Leonora to be guarded and reserved, unless she would
                  have made herself the fable of all Italy. —Vol. i. p. 296.</p>

               Complaint here is superseded by tender regret; solicitation by acknowledged sympathy;
               jealousy and suspense by gratitude and joy. The authoress is not pleased that while
               women mourn till death the loss of their companion, men usually change the elegiac
               strain composed for their first love, for epithalamiums on a marriage with a second.
               It is probably one among the many superstitions which rather injure than exalt the
               characters of women, which makes us, in spite of ourselves, set so high a price on
               their constancy even to the dead. Human beings in every stage of life need
                  companions;<pb n="476"/>women protectors; and except that, for the highminded and
               delicate, there are few worthy companions and protectors, and that if once a woman
               find one man on whom she may bestow without sorrow her tenderness, it is very
               unlikely that, losing him, she find a second, we know no cause in reason and
               morality, and hardly in good taste, which should condemn the lovely, bereaved, and
               ardent heart to perpetual widowhood.</p>
            <p>A woman's love is tenderness, and may wed itself to the lost and dead. A man's is
               passion, and must expend itself on the living. A woman's domesticity is of her own
               making, and her home may be replete with elegance though she be alone. An unmarried
               man has no home. A solitary woman is the world's victim, and there is heroism in her
               consecration. A man whose fate is not allied to a female, from whatever cause, is
               divested of every poetical attribute—there is something rugged, harsh, and unnatural
               in the very idea. After all, the worthiness of the beloved object must always stand
               as an excuse for inconstancy; or, with a poet, the fervency and truth of his passion:
               since, through the force of his imagination, he may dress in jewels richer than those
               that adorned the doll at Loretto, a black-visaged Madonna;<note>The statue of Our

               judging from the hardness and peremptoriness of her character, her love of ridicule,
               and her talent for sarcasm, that she first awoke the sting of the "Wasp of

                     >Pope</ref>.</note> and he, with all the bitterness of one whose person was but

            <p>The authoress sums up her work by a glance at the poets of the day, and their loves—a
               chapter as well left out, for she, fearing to tread on forbidden ground, tells us, in
               fact, nothing. Unable to throw the ideality of distance over the near and
               distinct—and afraid, justly so—for the practice of shewing up our friends is the vice
