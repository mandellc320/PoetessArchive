               another. Centuries are the children of one mighty family, but there is no
               family-likeness between them. We ourselves are standing on the threshold of a new
               era, and we are already hastening to make as wide a space, mark as vast a difference
               as possible, between our own age and its predecessor. Whatever follies we may go back
               upon, whatever opinions we may re-adopt, they are never those which have gone <hi rendition="#italics">immediately</hi> before us. Already there is a wide gulph
               between the last century and the present. In religion, in philosophy, in politics, in
               manners, there has passed a great change; but in none has been worked a greater
               change than in poetry, whether as it regards the art itself, or the general feeling
               towards it. The decline and fall of that Roman empire of the mind seems now advanced
               as an historical fact; while we are equally ready to admit that some twenty years
               since the republic was in its plenitude of power. In the meantime a new set of
               aspirants have arisen, and a new set of opinions are to be won. But it is from the
               past that we best judge of the present; and perhaps we shall more accurately say what
               poetry is by referring to what it has been.</p><p>Poetry in every country has had its origin in three sources, connected with the
               strongest feelings belonging to the human mind—Religion, War, and Love. The mysteries
               of the present; the still greater mysteries of the future; the confession of some
               superior power so deeply felt; higher impulses speaking so strongly of some spiritual
               influence of a purer order than those of our common wants and wishes;—these all found
               words and existence in poetry. The vainest fictions of mythology were the strongest
               possible evidence how necessary to the ignorance of humanity was the belief of a
               superior power; so entire was the interior conviction, that sooner than believe in
               nothing no belief was too absurd for adoption. The imagination, which is the source
               of poetry, has in every country been the beginning as well as the ornament of
               civilization. It civilizes because it refines. A general view of its influence in the
               various quarters of the globe will place this in the most striking point of view.</p><p>Africa is the least civilized quarter of the globe, not so much from its savage as
               from its apathetic state; one could almost believe that it had been formed from the
               dregs of the other parts. Now, the distinguishing mark of its deficiency in that soil
               of mind wherewith the intellect works, is its total want of imagination. It is the
               only great portion of the world which is not emphatically made known to us by its own
               peculiar religion. Her mythology was the earthly immortality of Greece. Greece is
               indelibly linked with the idea of civilization; but all those fine and graceful
               beliefs which made its springs holy places, and haunted the fragrant life of every
               flower and leaf, were the creations of earliest time. Look from thence to the fierce
               regions of the North,—how full is the Scandinavian faith of the wild and wonderful!
               or to the East, how gorgeous their tales of enchantment, with their delicate
                  Peris,<note>Supernatural beings of Persian mythology endowed with grace and
                  beauty.</note> and the fallen and fearful spirits in their subterranean
               caverns!—again, the faith of Brahma, with its thousand deities. Or, to cross the wide
               Atlantic, there are the vestiges of a terrible creed yet<pb n="467"/>touched with
               something of spiritual loveliness, in their singing-birds bringing tidings of the
               departed, and in the green hunting-grounds which made their future hope. Each and all
               these creeds are the work and wonder of the imagination—but in these Africa has no
               part. No august belief fills with beauty or terror the depths of her forests, and no
               fallen temple makes its site sacred though in ruins. Her creeds have neither beauty
               nor grandeur. The Devil is their principal Deity, and their devotion is born of
               physical fear. Other nations have had their various faiths, created and coloured by
               the scenes which gave them birth. The religion of Greece was beautiful as her own
               myrtle and olive groves. The Scandinavian was like its own wild mountains and snowy
               wastes, with just gleams of beauty from its starry nights and meteors. The Arabian
               was glowing and magnificent as the summer earth and radiant sky of its believers;
               while that of the American Indian was terrible as the huge serpents and the
               interminable forests which gave shelter to its mysteries. But in Africa the sunny
               sky, the noble rivers, the woods, splendid in size and foliage, have been without
               their wonted effect. Slaves from the earliest period, the very superstitions of her
               sable sons are mean fears caught from their masters; all about them is earthly,
               utterly unredeemed by those spiritual awakenings which are as lights from another
               world. We might believe that some great original curse has been said over them, and
               that they are given over into the hand of man and not of God. And in simple truth
               that curse has been slavery. The Helots<note>Serfs of ancient Sparta.</note> even of
               Greece were uninspired. "A slave cannot be eloquent," said <ref target="people.html#Longinus"><name>Longinus</name></ref><note><ref target="people.html#LandonLetitia"><name>Landon</name></ref> probably relies on her memory of Section XLIV of William Smith's 1739
                  translation of <ref target="people.html#Longinus"><name>Longinus</name></ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics"><title>On the Sublime</title></hi>, "but never yet did a slave become an orator." Smith's rendering established
                  the text for English audiences and was frequently reprinted into the nineteenth
                  century.</note>; nor poetical either—the wells of his enthusiasm are dried up.
               What some ancient writer says of iron may be applied to Poetry—its use is the first
               step to civilization, and civilization is freedom.</p><p>Next to Religion War was the great source of poetry; and the deeds of the brave were
               sung in that spirit of encouragement which one man will ever receive from the praise
               bestowed on the deeds of another, when he meditates similar achievements of his own.
               And here we may be permitted a few words on what we cannot but consider an unjust and
               erroneous opinion, now much insisted upon,—that poets and conquerors have been equal
               enemies of the human race—the one but acting what the other praised; and that the sin
               of encouragement was equal, if not greater, than that of commission. In answer to
               this we must observe that it is not fair to judge of former actions by our present
               standard. Our first view of society is always the same: we see the human race
               dwelling in small dispersed sets, with rude habits, the results of hardships and of
               dangers. A more favourable situation, or, more commonly, the influence of some
               superior mind, which from the wonderful effects produced by a single man is often a
               nation's history: these or similar causes first placed some of the tribes in
               positions of comparative comfort and advancement. This position would of course be
               envied by their savage and starving neighbours, who would consider brute force the
               only means of sharing their advantages. Single motives never last: ambition,
               aggrandisement, conquest with a view to security, soon gave a thousand motives to
               warfare that had originally began in want and self-defence. It has required centuries
               so to consolidate kingdoms that now a breathing space is allowed for reflection on
               the sin of sacrificing man's most valuable possession—life. But what part has the
               poet taken in these scenes of bloodshed? One certainly of amelioration. If he has
               sung of con-<lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">2 h 2</hi></fw><pb n="468"/>querors, the qualities held up to admiration were those of magnanimity
               and generosity. He has spoken of the love of liberty as holding light the love of
               life; and the highest eulogium of a warrior was that he died in defence of his native
               country. But to give our assertion the support of an example—Perhaps the spirit which
               animates, the desire which excites, the power which supports, a conqueror, were never
               more entirely personified than in <ref target="people.html#Xerxes">Xerxes</ref>. He
               possessed to the utmost that grasping ambition, that carelessness of human blood,
               which characterize the mere conqueror; yet with all the purple pomp of his power, we
               are not aware of his having been held up otherwise than in reprobation, while the
               whole world has been filled with the fame of his brave opposers; and the names of
               those who fell at Marathon are still the watchwords of freedom. Again, in the days of
               chivalry, what were the qualities the minstrel lauded in the knight?—his valour,
               certainly, but still more his courtesy, his protection of the weak against the
               strong, his devotion, his truth;—till the "ungentle knight" was almost as much a
               phrase of disgrace as that of the "recreant."</p><p>Love was the third great fountain of poetry's inspiration; and who that has ever
               loved will deny the necessity of a language, beyond the working-day tongue of our
               ordinary run of hopes and fears, to express feelings which have so little in common
               with them. What has been the most popular love-poetry in all countries?—that which
               gave expression to its spiritual and better part—constancy kept like a holy
               thing—blessings on the beloved one, though in that blessing we have ourselves no
               share; or sad and affectionate regrets in whose communion our own nature grows more
               kindly from its sympathy. We are always the better for entering into other’s sorrow
               or other's joy.</p><p>The whole origin and use of poetry may be expressed in a few brief words: it
               originates in that idea of superior beauty and excellence inherent in every
               nature—and it is employed to keep that idea alive; and the very belief in excellence
               is one cause of its existence. When we speak of poetry as the fountain whence youth
               draws enthusiasm for its hopes,—where the warrior strengthens his courage, and the
               lover his faith,—the treasury where the noblest thoughts are garnered,—the archives
               where the noblest deeds are recorded,—we but express an old belief. One of our great
               reviews—the "<ref target="people.html#WestminsterReview"><title>Westminster</title></ref>"—in speaking of the fine arts, &amp;c. says, "The aristocracy do well to
               encourage poetry: it is by fiction themselves exist—and what is poetry but
                  fiction?"<note>Not identified.</note> fiction; its merit and its power lie alike
               in its truth: to one heart the aspiring and elevated will come home; to another the
               simple and natural: the keynote to one will be the voice of memory, which brings back
               young affections—early confidence,—hill and valley yet glad with the buoyant step
               which once past over them,—flowers thrice lovely from thoughts indelibly associated
               with their leaf or breath: such as these are touched by all that restores, while it
               recalls, days whose enjoyment would have been happiness, could they but have had the
               knowledge of experience without its weariness. To another, poetry will be a vision
               and a delight, because the virtue of which he dreams is there realized—and because
               the "love which his spirit has painted"<note><ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge"><name>Byron</name></ref>,"Stanzas to [Augusta]" 7.</note> is to be found in its pages. But in each
               and all cases the deep well of sympathy is only to be found when the hazel rod is
               poised by the hand of truth. And, till some moral steam is discovered as potent as
               that now so active in the physical<pb n="469"/>world, vain will be the effort to
               regulate mankind like machinery: there will ever be spiritual awakenings, and deep
               and tender thoughts, to turn away from the hurry and highways of life, and whose
               place of refuge will still be the green paths and pleasant waters of poesy. That
               tribes of worse than idle followers have crowded the temple, and cast the dust they
               brought around the soiled altar,—that many have profaned their high gift to base
               use—that poetry has often turned aside from its divine origin and diviner end,—is
               what must be equally admitted and lamented; but who will deny that our best and most
               popular (indeed in this case best and popular are equivalent terms) poetry makes its
               appeal to the higher and better feelings of our nature, and not a poet but owes his
               fame to that which best deserves it? What a code of pure and beautiful morality,
               applicable to almost every circumstance, might be drawn from <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"><name>Shakspeare</name></ref>!</p><p>The influence of poetry has two eras,—first as it tends to civilize; secondly as it
               tends to prevent that very civilization from growing too cold and too selfish. Its
               first is its period of action; its second is that of feeling and reflection: it is
               that second period which at present exists. On the mere principle of utility, in our
               wide and weary world, with its many sorrows and more cares, how anxiously we ought to
               keep open every source of happiness! and who among us does not recollect some hour
               when a favourite poet spread before us a page like that of a magician's; when some
               expression has seemed like the very echo of our feelings; how often and with what a
               sensation of pleasure have long-remembered passages sprang to our lips; how every
               natural beauty has caught a fresh charm from being linked with some associate verse!
               Who that has these or similar recollections but would keep the ear open, and the
               heart alive, to the "song that lightens the languid way!"<note><ref target="people.html#MooreThomas"><name>Sir Thomas Moore's</name></ref> "Boat Glee," a ballad from the comic opera <hi rendition="#italics">M. P.,
                     or The Blue Stocking</hi> (1811).</note></p><p>Why one age should be more productive in poetry than another is one of those
               questions—a calculation of the mental longitude—likely to remain unanswered. That
               peculiar circumstances do not create the poet is proved by the fact, that only one
               individual is so affected: if it were mere circumstance, it would affect alike all
               who are brought within its contact. What confirmation of this theory (if theory it
               be) is to be found in the history of all poets!—where are we to seek the cause which
               made them such, if not in their own minds? We daily see men living amid beautiful
               scenery; and scenery is much dwelt upon the advocates of circumstance. Switzerland is
               a most beautiful country, yet what great poet has it ever produced? The spirit which
               in ancient days peopled grove and mountain with Dryad and Oread,<note> Nymphs from
                  classical mythology.</note> or, in modern times, with associations, must be in him
               who sees, not in the object seen. How many there are, leading a life of literary
               leisure, living in a romantic country, and writing poetry all their days, who yet go
               down to their unremembered graves no more poets than if they had never turned a
               stanza! While, on the other hand, we see men with every obstacle before them, with
               little leisure and less encouragement, yet force their upward way, make their voice
               heard, and leave their memory in imperishable song. Take <ref target="people.html#BurnsRobert"><name>Burns</name></ref> for an example: much stress has been laid on the legendary ballads he was
               accustomed to hear from infancy; but if these were so potent, why did they not
               inspire his brother as well as himself? <ref target="people.html#BurnsGilbert"><name>Mr. Gilbert Burns</name></ref> is recorded, by every biographer, to have been a sensible, and even a superior
               man; he dwelt in the same country—he heard the same songs—why was he not a poet too?
               There can be but one<pb n="470"/> answer,—there was not that inherent quality in his
               mind which there was in his brother's. Many young men are born to a higher name than
               fortune—many spend their youth amid the most exciting scenes—yet why do none of these
               turn out a <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge"><name>Byron</name></ref>, but for some innate first cause? What made <ref target="people.html#MiltonJohn"><name>Milton</name></ref> in old age,—in sickness, in poverty—depressed by all that would have weighed
               to the very dust an ordinary man—without one of man's ordinary encouragements,—what
               could have made him turn to the future as to a home, collect his glorious energies,
               and finish a work, the noblest aid ever given to the immortality of a language? What,
               but that indefinable spirit, whose enthusiasm is nature's own gift to the poet. <hi rendition="#italics">Poeta nascitur non fit</hi><note> The poet is born, not made.</note> is, like many other old truths, the very
               truth after all.</p><p>We cannot but consider that, though some be still among us, our own great poets
               belong to another age. Their fame is established, and their horde of imitators have
               dispersed; those wearying followers who, to use the happy expression of a
               contemporary writer, "think that breaking the string is bending the bow of <ref target="people.html#Ulysses"><name>Ulysses</name></ref>." We hear daily complaints of the want of present taste and talent for poetry:
               we are more prepared to admit the latter than the former. In the most sterile times
               of the imagination, love of poetry has never been lacking; the taste may have been
               bad, but still the taste existed. <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"><name>Wordsworth</name></ref> truly says, "that, with the young, poetry is a passion;"<note> Essay,
                  "Supplementary to the Preface" to <hi rendition="#italics">Lyrical Ballads.</hi>
                  (1815) </note> and there will always be youth in the world to indulge the hopes,
               and feel the warm and fresh emotions, which their fathers have found to be vain, or
               have utterly exhausted. To these, poetry will ever be a natural language; and it is
               the young who make the reputation of a poet. We soon lose that keen delight, which
               marvels if others share not in it: the faculty of appreciation is the first which
               leaves us. It is tact rather than feeling which enables experience to foresee the
               popularity of a new poet. As to the alleged want of taste, we only refer to the
               editions of established authors which still find purchasers: one has just appeared of
                  <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter"><name>Scott</name></ref>, another of <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge"><name>Byron</name></ref>. With what enthusiasm do some set up <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"><name>Wordsworth</name></ref> for an idol, and others <ref target="people.html#ShelleyPercy"><name>Shelley</name></ref>! But this taste is quite another feeling to that which creates; and the little
               now written possesses beauty not originality. The writers do not set their own mark
               on their property: one might have put forth the work of the other, or it might be
               that of their predecessors. This was not the case some few years ago. Who could have
               mistaken the picturesque and chivalric pages of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter"><name>Scott</name></ref> for the impassioned one of <ref target="people.html#ByronGeorge"><name>Byron</name></ref>? or who could for a moment have hesitated as to whether a poem was marked with
               the actual and benevolent philosophy of <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"><name>Wordsworth</name></ref>, or the beautiful but ideal theory of <ref target="people.html#ShelleyPercy"><name>Shelley</name></ref>? We are now producing no great or original (the words are synonymous) poet. We
               have graceful singing in the bower, but no voice that startles us into wonder, and
               hurries us forth to see whose trumpet is awakening the land. We know that when the
               snow has long lain, warming and fertilizing the ground, and when the late summer
               comes, hot and clear, the rich harvest will be abundant under such genial influences.
               Perhaps poetry too may have its atmosphere; and a long cold winter may be needed for
               its glad and glorious summer. The soil of song, like that of earth, may need rest for
               renewal. Again we repeat, that though the taste be not, the spirit of the day is,
               adverse to the production of poetry. Selfishness is its principle, indifference its
               affectation, and ridicule its commonplace. We allow no appeals save to our reason, or
               to our fear <pb n="471"/> of laughter. We must either be convinced or sneered into
               things. Neither calculation nor sarcasm are the elements for poetry. A remark made by
                  <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter"><name>Scott</name></ref> to one of his great compeers shows how he knew the age in which he was fated
               to end his glorious career:—"Ah—it is well that we have made our reputation!" The
               personal is the destroyer of the spiritual; and to the former everything is now
               referred. We talk of the author's self more than his works, and we know his name
               rather than his writings. There is a base macadamizing spirit in literature; we seek
               to level all the high places of old. But till we can deny that fine "farther looking hope"<note><ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam"><name>Wordsworth</name></ref>, "The Force of Prayer, or, The Founding of Boulton Priory, A Tradition" 47.
               </note> which gives such a charm to <ref target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam"><name>Shakespeare's</name></ref> confessional sonnets; till we can deny that "<title>The Paradise Lost</title>"
               was the work of old age, poverty, and neglect, roused into delightful exertion by a
               bright futurity; till we can deny the existence of those redeemers of humanity—we
               must admit, also, the existence of a higher, more prophetic, more devoted and
               self-relying spirit than is to be accounted for on the principles either of vanity or
               of lucre: we shall be compelled to admit that its inspiration is, indeed, <quote><lg type="stanza"><l>A heavenly breath</l><l>Along an earthly lyre.<note><ref target="people.html#BlanchardLaman"><name>Laman Blanchard</name></ref>, "The Spirit of Poesy" 5-6.</note></l></lg></quote></p><p>Methinks there are some mysteries in the soul on whose precincts it were well to

                  phrase.</note> Poetry like religion requires faith, and we are the better and
               happier for yielding it. The imagination is to the mind what life is to the body—its
               vivifying and active part. In antiquity, poetry had to create, it now has to
               preserve. Its first effort was against barbarism, its last is against selfishness. A
               world of generous emotions, of kindly awakenings, those <quote><lg type="stanza"><l>Which bid the perished pleasures move</l><l>In mournful mockery o'er the soul of love;<note><ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuel">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</ref>,
                           "Lines On an Autumnal Evening" 7-8.</note></l></lg></quote> a world of thought and feeling, now lies in the guardianship of the poet.
               These are they who sit in the gate called the beautiful, which leads to the temple.
               Its meanest priests should feel that their office is sacred. Enthusiasm is no passion
               of the drawing-room, or of the pence-table: its home is the heart, and its hope is
               afar. This is too little the creed of our generation; yet, without such creed, poetry
               has neither present life nor future immortality. As <ref target="people.html#WhiteheadCharles"><name>Whitehead</name></ref> finely says in his poem of "The Solitary,"—<quote><lg type="stanza"><l rendition="#indent1">Not for herself, not for the wealth she brings,</l><l>Is the muse wooed and won, but for the deep,</l><l rendition="#indent1">Occult, profound, unfathomabl things,—</l><l>The engine of our tears whene'er we weep,</l><l>The impulse of our dreams when'er we sleep,</l><l rendition="#indent1">The mysteries that our sad hearts possess,</l><l>Which, and the keys whereof, the Muse doth keep,—</l><l rendition="#indent1">Oh ! to kindle soft humanity, to raise,</l><l>With gentle strength infused, the spirit bowed;</l><l rendition="#indent1">To pour a second sunlight on our days,</l><l>And draw the restless lightining from our cloud;</l><l>To cheer the humble and to dash the proud.</l><l rendition="#indent1">Besought in peace to live, in peace to die,—</l><l rendition="#indent1">The poet's task is done—Oh, Immortality! <note><ref target="people.html#WhiteheadCharles"><name>Charles Whitehead</name></ref> (1804-1862), <hi rendition="#italics">The Solitary</hi>
