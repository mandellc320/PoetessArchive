				<p><hi rendition="#largest">T</hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">he</hi> title of this
					production leads us to examine the <hi rendition="#italics">dramatis
						person&#230;</hi> as a painter examines the several pictures of a collected
					groupe of figures, representing a variety of characters; and, according to this
					mode of examination, we shall pass our strictures on the <hi
						rendition="#italics">pictures</hi> exhibited on this canvas. The most
					prominent figure of the piece is Sir Gilbert Oxmondeley; who, from having been
					born plain Gilbert Oxmondeley, and been bred to the trade of a glover and hosier
					in Cheapside, is turned round on the sportive wheel of fortune, and thrown into
					the rank of baroner, with the appendage of four thousand pounds in a year. Such
					a change in circumstances naturally produces a change of manners; which are well
					described in the author&apos;s own words: </p>
				<pb n="137"/>

				<quote><p> The baronet, as is natural to suppose, in a man undergoing so sudden a
						change of circumstances, lost what few good qualities he had ever possessed,
						in such vicious ones, as he had never before dreamt of;&#8212;his sentiments
						and manners underwent as speedy a metamorphose, as the house and furniture
						of Goody Baucis and her good man Philemon.<hi rendition="#sup"><note
								place="foot">From <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Jonathan
									Swift</ref>&apos;s <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Baucis and
										Philemon, Imitated from Ovid</title></hi>
							(1709).</note></hi> The counter-bow and smirk, with the indiscriminately
						applied sentences of, &quot;much obliged to your
						ladyship,&quot;&#8212;&quot;thank you, sir,&quot; were converted into a
						stiff gait and sneer at the little world below him, with a continual
						grumbling cough in his throat, which seemed to say, &quot;dam&apos;me,
						don&apos;t you know who I am?&quot; </p></quote>
				<p> This is a good painting.&#8212;Miss Eliza, Sir Gilbert&apos;s daughter, has
					educated herself principally by the assistance of novels, and consequently
					marries the first man who asks the honor of her fair hand, reduces herself to
					poverty, and flies from her creditors to the stage.&#8212;This, though not an
					original, is a good <hi rendition="#italics">copy</hi>.&#8212;The family of the
					Hutchinbuncks is well executed; and the Dutch boy, or man in miniature, is <hi
						rendition="#italics">alive</hi>:&#8212;but the foundling Rachel is too
					formal, sententious, and affected, for a country girl bred up in a
					parsonage-house with the good simple Mr. Morden: the <hi rendition="#italics"
						>colours</hi> are therefore not natural. </p>
				<p> Jonathan Parkinson, the quaker and no quaker, (being only so called by the <hi
						rendition="#italics">world</hi> because he wore plain clothes and a flat
					crown&apos;d hat, lest he should offend the memory of his ancestors; and who
					retained also for the same reason the peculiarity of that stiff phraseology used
					by the sect,) forms the picture which pleases us the least in the piece. It <hi
						rendition="#italics">may be</hi> that, as Jonathan Parkinson is not friendly
					to our court of criticism, he must allow for our being a little <hi
						rendition="#italics">piqued</hi> that a man, who is exalted by the
					liberality of his sentiments, should so set his face against poor Reviewers as
					to refuse all acquaintance with us, and to <hi rendition="#italics">judge
						us</hi> severely without knowing us: for Jonathan&apos;s own words are, on
					being presented by a bookseller with two <hi rendition="#italics">new
						Reviews</hi>,&#8212;&quot;I do thank thee, friend, for thy civility, but <hi
						rendition="#italics">I do never read </hi>
					<hi rendition="#smcaps">those books</hi>.&quot;&#8212;Now human creatures are
					not always good Christians, and so disposed to forgive as they ought to be; it
					may therefore be considered as a venial sin, if we exult a little over the
					fallible virtue of this <hi rendition="#italics">preacher</hi> and <hi
						rendition="#italics">pattern of moral rectitude;</hi> and if we <hi
						rendition="#italics">smile</hi> when we see him peeping over the shoulder of
					the frail Miss Darlington, who presents him with two illegitimate pledges of an
					illicit amour. The <hi rendition="#italics">costume</hi> of this <hi
						rendition="#italics">portrait</hi> is ill preserved. </p>
				<p> The dashing Cranberry, the cold-blooded Alfred, the gamester Lady Paragon, the
					swindler Blackman, the travell&apos;d Sir Bauble, and many others, are rather
					daubings than good pictures;&#8212;the colours are unnatural.&#8212;We give the
					following chapter as a specimen of the work: </p>
				<pb n="138"/>
				<quote><p> In the evening, a clod-pole, who had been employed by Miss Oxmondeley to
						carry Emily&apos;s letter to her brother, returned with the answer; and
						having received his promised reward from the hand of Eliza, she flew with
						the letter to Emily, for whom it was directed. </p>
					<p> It contained the wished for information, that the beaus, as Eliza called
						them, were highly flattered by the invitation, and would be at Fairford
						early in the morning. </p>
					<p> &quot;Dear me,&quot; said Emily, &quot;what will Sir Gilbert say to their
						coming so soon in the morning?&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Oh,&quot; said Miss Oxmondeley, &quot;I&apos;ll tell him they come
						early on purpose to see the lions.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Dear me,&quot; returned Emily, &quot;why you have no lions here, have
						you?&quot; </p>
					<p> When Miss Oxmondeley could suppress her laughter sufficiently to explain
						herself, Emily much approved of her friend&apos;s intention; but Rachel said
						she feared it was a hazardous plan, as she hardly imagined the gentlemen
						would investigate the curiosities of Fairford with the leisure or attention
						Sir Gilbert would expect, from the account she had just given him of their
						taste.</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; replied Eliza, &quot;leave that to me, I know every step my
						father takes in the morning, and will lead them a different way from that I
						know he has taken; and when we meet, which I&apos;ll contrive shan&apos;t be
						till dinner, I&apos;ll tell him, I have been forced to show them all about
						myself, as I could not find him.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;But should the deceit be discovered&quot;&#8212;said Rachel. </p>
					<p> &quot;I&apos;ll contrive some excuse, I warrant me, to bring us off,&quot;
						said Miss Oxmondeley. </p>
					<p> &quot;And if it should not&quot;&#8212;continued Rachel hesitatingly. </p>
					<p> &quot;Why all the better,&quot; replied Eliza, insensible to the very gentle
						reproof Rachel ventured to give to her improper conduct. </p>
					<p> &quot;I was quite frightened at dinner,&quot; said Emily, &quot;when you
						told your papa about their coming.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Oh, I know how to cuff him over,&quot; replied Eliza, half ashamed she
						did not possess absolute dominion over her father. </p>
					<p> &quot;And now he does not know Alfred is to be here,&quot; returned Emily. </p>
					<p> &quot;I have a trick to introduce him with,&quot; replied Eliza. </p>
					<p> &quot;I think you run great risks, Miss Oxmondeley,&quot; said Rachel,
						&quot;of incurring Sir Gilbert&apos;s displeasure, to obtain a gratification
						which the anxiety that its purchase occasions must, in my opinion, in a
						great measure outweigh.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Oh! that&apos;s half the pleasure,&quot; returned Miss Oxmondeley;
						&quot;it is so romantic to impose on a father, and so delightful to plan
						schemes and stratagems for seeing the pretty fellows.&quot; </p>
					<p> Rachel durst admonish no farther, on so slight an acquaintance, with one
						acknowledged by the world so far her superior in rank, and remained silent.
						Emily Morden, who never thought for herself, was always of opinion of the
						last speaker. </p>
					<pb n="139"/>
					<p> On the succeeding day, Sir Gilbert, as was his usual custom, walked into his
						grounds immediately after breakfast; he had strolled nearly the round, had
						rested once in the hermitage, and stopped twice to admire the Chinese
						temple, (his favorite building, because it had cost the largest sum in
						erecting,) when proceeding, he arrived within a few paces of the ruin, which
						represented the angle of a gothic building, with a dilapidated window
						supported between two mouldering pillars; as he stood viewing the venerable
						structure, a voice behind it called out &quot;Here&apos;s at your cock
						robin,&quot; and immediately a large stone flew over his head. </p>
					<p> &quot;Hollo! hollo!&quot; exclaimed the astonished baronet. </p>
					<p> &quot;Hollo! hollo!&quot; repeated a voice. </p>
					<p> &quot;What&apos;s here, an echo?&quot; cried another speaker. &quot;Hollo!
						hollo! again.&quot; </p>
					<p> The baronet was mean while rapidly approaching, and distinctly heard his
						daughter say, &quot;Oh Lud a mercy, it&apos;s papa, I dare say! I hope he
						did not see us.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;I&apos;ll climb up these stones and peep,&quot; said the first voice. </p>
					<p> In a few seconds, a face appeared through the frame-work of the window; and
						in less than in an instant the fragment of antiquity, in reality no more
						firmly built than it was really meant to appear, yielded to the weight
						imposed upon it, crumbled, fell, and carried with it to the ground the
						person in question. </p>
					<p> The scene fallen, the actors behind it became conspicuous; and Miss
						Oxmondeley, Mr. Cranberry, and Rachel, appeared standing in various
						attitudes of terror and surprise&#8212;Miss Emily and Alfred sitting on the
						grass, at a short distance from the scene of action, and John Morden lying
						prostrate amongst the ruined ruins. </p>
					<p> &quot;Here&apos;s a pretty spot of work!&quot; cried the baronet, &quot;the
						mouldering walls of my abbey all in ruins!&#8212;How the devil came you to
						climb up it, you imp of vexation?&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Have you hurt yourself,&quot; said Eliza, advancing to John. </p>
					<p> &quot;Oh, no!&quot; said he, rising gently, while he held one hand on his
						back, and rubbed his left knee with the other. </p>
					<p> &quot;If you had broken your neck, I should not have pitied you,&quot; cried
						the baronet. </p>
					<p> &quot;If he had,&quot; returned Eliza, &quot;it would have signified little
						to him, whether you had or not&#8212;your compassion would be of much more
						consequence to him now, for I&apos;m sure he&apos;s hurt.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Here&apos;s at your cock Robin, indeed!&quot; exclaimed Sir Gilbert,
						settling the flaps of his waistcoat with both his hands, and moving about
						his fingers in painful agitation. </p>
					<p> &quot;Give me leave to introduce Mr. Cranberry to you, papa.&quot; </p>
					<p> Cranberry bowed, scraped, muttered a great deal, and said nothing. </p>
					<p> &quot;How do you do, sir?&quot; said Sir Gilbert impatiently.&#8212;
						&quot;If it had been my Chinese temple, instead of this ruin, I&apos;d have
						broken your neck for you, myself, puppy!&quot; he continued, turning to
						John. </p>
					<p> &quot;Is there a Chinese-temple in these gardens?&quot; asked Cranberry with
						affected eagerness and pleasure. </p>
					<pb n="140"/>
					<p> &quot;Yes sir, yes sir,&quot; answered Sir Gilbert, placidity returning to
						his bow. </p>
					<p> Cranberry had already received his cue from Eliza, and now turning quickly
						round to Rachel, exclaimed, &quot;Oh, you cruel creature, not to point it
						out to me, when you know my partiality for those buildings!&quot; </p>
					<p> John Morden, advancing to Sir Gilbert, said, &quot;I beg pardon, Sir
						Gilbert, but I thought those mock ruins had always been built
						stronger.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Well, well,&quot; said the baronet, &quot;it is some consolation that
						I can afford to build another.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;If I might be allowed to speak,&quot; said Cranberry, &quot;I think it
						gives the idea it was meant to convey much more forcibly in its present
						state than it did before.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Indeed!&quot; replied the baronet, &quot;Surely not:&quot; he gave a
						moment&apos;s pause to observation, then added, &quot;let me stand where you
						do a minute, sir, if you please.&quot; </p>
					<p> Eliza ran up to her father, and peeping over his shoulder, &quot;Oh,
						decidedly, decidedly,&quot; she cried. </p>
					<p> &quot;Decidedly, what?&quot; asked the baronet. </p>
					<p> &quot;More mutilated, papa,&quot; answered she. </p>
					<p> &quot;Oh, infinitely more ruinous and dilapidated,&quot; added Cranberry. </p>
					<p> &quot;But my robin is lost,&quot; said Sir Gilbert, with a sigh; &quot;I
						don&apos;t like that.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Ay, flown away,&quot; cried John, still holding his knee; &quot;it
						would have been a good thing for me, if I could have taken wing like
						it:&quot; a wink to Eliza and Cranberry followed this sentence. </p>
					<p> &quot;Why, did you really think it was alive?&quot; asked the baronet, with
						pleasure sparkling in his eyes. </p>
					<p> &quot;Why was it not?&quot; said John, with affected surprise. </p>
					<p> &quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; exclaimed Sir Gilbert, unable to contain his extacy;
						&quot;you were really taken in then, ha! ha! ha! you are not the first that
						has been taken in about that robin.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;No, nor the last neither,&quot; said Eliza, looking archly at her
						companions. </p>
					<p> &quot;No, no, no,&quot; returned the baronet; &quot;I can&apos;t help
						laughing though at the thoughts of it;&#8212;I can easily have the ruin
						mended, and another bird put up.&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;Besides you can vary your subject, and the deception will have the
						better effect,&quot; remarked Cranberry. </p>
					<p> &quot;True, sir, true, so it will; those that have seen it before, will
						think the robin has flown away, indeed,&quot; returned the baronet. </p>
					<p> &quot;But the Chinese temple, Sir Gilbert&#8212;&quot; </p>
					<p> &quot;I&apos;m on the road to it now,&quot; answered the exulting baronet;
						&quot;walk you behind Eliza,&quot; continued he, &quot;you have seen it
						often enough, and it is not worth a pin, without you have a clear view of it
						breaking upon you from amongst the trees;&#8212;walk on, sir, walk on, the
						path will lead you to it;&quot; and on they moved, Eliza and John rejoicing
						in the happy change John&apos;s maneuver had worked on the baronet&apos;s
						temper. </p>

				<p> We are sorry that we have not been more entertained with the whole of this

					from the comic powers of Mr. Lathom; and that we have met with scenes not
					unworthy of the drama, where the ridicule is well painted which resulted from
					pride, ostentation, and vanity, grafted on low birth, mean education, and
					defective intellects. Prolixity is the great fault of this author, and it is
					indeed too common an error. It is to be wished that writers of all descriptions
					would study the <hi rendition="#italics">multum in parvo</hi>,<hi
