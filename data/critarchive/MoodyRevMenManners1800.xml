            <p><hi rendition="#largest">T</hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">he</hi> title of this
               production leads us to examine the <hi rendition="#italics">dramatis personæ</hi> as
               a painter examines the several pictures of a collected groupe of figures,
               representing a variety of characters; and, according to this mode of examination, we
               shall pass our strictures on the <hi rendition="#italics">pictures</hi> exhibited on
               this canvas. The most prominent figure of the piece is Sir Gilbert Oxmondeley; who,
               from having been born plain Gilbert Oxmondeley, and been bred to the trade of a
               glover and hosier in Cheapside, is turned round on the sportive wheel of fortune, and
               thrown into the rank of baroner, with the appendage of four thousand pounds in a
               year. Such a change in circumstances naturally produces a change of manners; which
               are well described in the author's own words: </p>
            <pb n="137"/>
            <quote><p> The baronet, as is natural to suppose, in a man undergoing so sudden a change
                  of circumstances, lost what few good qualities he had ever possessed, in such
                  vicious ones, as he had never before dreamt of;—his sentiments and manners
                  underwent as speedy a metamorphose, as the house and furniture of Goody Baucis and
                  her good man Philemon.<note>From <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Jonathan
                        Swift</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Baucis and Philemon, Imitated
                           from Ovid</title></hi> (1709).</note> The counter-bow and smirk, with the
                  indiscriminately applied sentences of, "much obliged to your ladyship,"—"thank
                  you, sir," were converted into a stiff gait and sneer at the little world below
                  him, with a continual grumbling cough in his throat, which seemed to say, "dam'me,
                  don't you know who I am?" </p></quote>
            <p> This is a good painting.—Miss Eliza, Sir Gilbert's daughter, has educated herself
               principally by the assistance of novels, and consequently marries the first man who
               asks the honor of her fair hand, reduces herself to poverty, and flies from her
               creditors to the stage.—This, though not an original, is a good <hi
                  rendition="#italics">copy</hi>.—The family of the Hutchinbuncks is well executed;
               and the Dutch boy, or man in miniature, is <hi rendition="#italics">alive</hi>:—but
               the foundling Rachel is too formal, sententious, and affected, for a country girl
               bred up in a parsonage-house with the good simple Mr. Morden: the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">colours</hi> are therefore not natural. </p>
            <p> Jonathan Parkinson, the quaker and no quaker, (being only so called by the <hi
                  rendition="#italics">world</hi> because he wore plain clothes and a flat crown'd
               hat, lest he should offend the memory of his ancestors; and who retained also for the
               same reason the peculiarity of that stiff phraseology used by the sect,) forms the
               picture which pleases us the least in the piece. It <hi rendition="#italics">may
                  be</hi> that, as Jonathan Parkinson is not friendly to our court of criticism, he
               must allow for our being a little <hi rendition="#italics">piqued</hi> that a man,
               who is exalted by the liberality of his sentiments, should so set his face against
               poor Reviewers as to refuse all acquaintance with us, and to <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >judge us</hi> severely without knowing us: for Jonathan's own words are, on being
               presented by a bookseller with two <hi rendition="#italics">new Reviews</hi>,—"I do
               thank thee, friend, for thy civility, but <hi rendition="#italics">I do never read
                  </hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">those books</hi>."—Now human creatures are not always
               good Christians, and so disposed to forgive as they ought to be; it may therefore be
               considered as a venial sin, if we exult a little over the fallible virtue of this <hi
                  rendition="#italics">preacher</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">pattern of moral
                  rectitude;</hi> and if we <hi rendition="#italics">smile</hi> when we see him
               peeping over the shoulder of the frail Miss Darlington, who presents him with two
               illegitimate pledges of an illicit amour. The <hi rendition="#italics">costume</hi>
               of this <hi rendition="#italics">portrait</hi> is ill preserved. </p>
            <p> The dashing Cranberry, the cold-blooded Alfred, the gamester Lady Paragon, the
               swindler Blackman, the travell'd Sir Bauble, and many others, are rather daubings
               than good pictures;—the colours are unnatural.—We give the following chapter as a
               specimen of the work: </p>
            <pb n="138"/>
            <quote><p> In the evening, a clod-pole, who had been employed by Miss Oxmondeley to
                  carry Emily's letter to her brother, returned with the answer; and having received
                  his promised reward from the hand of Eliza, she flew with the letter to Emily, for
                  whom it was directed. </p><p> It contained the wished for information, that the
                  beaus, as Eliza called them, were highly flattered by the invitation, and would be
                  at Fairford early in the morning. </p><p> "Dear me," said Emily, "what will Sir
                  Gilbert say to their coming so soon in the morning?" </p><p> "Oh," said Miss
                  Oxmondeley, "I'll tell him they come early on purpose to see the lions." </p><p>
                  "Dear me," returned Emily, "why you have no lions here, have you?" </p><p> When
                  Miss Oxmondeley could suppress her laughter sufficiently to explain herself, Emily
                  much approved of her friend's intention; but Rachel said she feared it was a
                  hazardous plan, as she hardly imagined the gentlemen would investigate the
                  curiosities of Fairford with the leisure or attention Sir Gilbert would expect,
                  from the account she had just given him of their taste.</p><p>"Oh!" replied Eliza,
                  "leave that to me, I know every step my father takes in the morning, and will lead
                  them a different way from that I know he has taken; and when we meet, which I'll
                  contrive shan't be till dinner, I'll tell him, I have been forced to show them all
                  about myself, as I could not find him." </p><p> "But should the deceit be
                  discovered"—said Rachel. </p><p> "I'll contrive some excuse, I warrant me, to
                  bring us off," said Miss Oxmondeley. </p><p> "And if it should not"—continued
                  Rachel hesitatingly. </p><p> "Why all the better," replied Eliza, insensible to
                  the very gentle reproof Rachel ventured to give to her improper conduct. </p><p>
                  "I was quite frightened at dinner," said Emily, "when you told your papa about
                  their coming." </p><p> "Oh, I know how to cuff him over," replied Eliza, half
                  ashamed she did not possess absolute dominion over her father. </p><p> "And now he
                  does not know Alfred is to be here," returned Emily. </p><p> "I have a trick to
                  introduce him with," replied Eliza. </p><p> "I think you run great risks, Miss
                  Oxmondeley," said Rachel, "of incurring Sir Gilbert's displeasure, to obtain a
                  gratification which the anxiety that its purchase occasions must, in my opinion,
                  in a great measure outweigh." </p><p> "Oh! that's half the pleasure," returned
                  Miss Oxmondeley; "it is so romantic to impose on a father, and so delightful to
                  plan schemes and stratagems for seeing the pretty fellows." </p><p> Rachel durst
                  admonish no farther, on so slight an acquaintance, with one acknowledged by the
                  world so far her superior in rank, and remained silent. Emily Morden, who never
                  thought for herself, was always of opinion of the last speaker. </p><pb n="139"
                  /><p> On the succeeding day, Sir Gilbert, as was his usual custom, walked into his
                  grounds immediately after breakfast; he had strolled nearly the round, had rested
                  once in the hermitage, and stopped twice to admire the Chinese temple, (his
                  favorite building, because it had cost the largest sum in erecting,) when
                  proceeding, he arrived within a few paces of the ruin, which represented the angle
                  of a gothic building, with a dilapidated window supported between two mouldering
                  pillars; as he stood viewing the venerable structure, a voice behind it called out
                  "Here's at your cock robin," and immediately a large stone flew over his head.
                  </p><p> "Hollo! hollo!" exclaimed the astonished baronet. </p><p> "Hollo! hollo!"
                  repeated a voice. </p><p> "What's here, an echo?" cried another speaker. "Hollo!
                  hollo! again." </p><p> The baronet was mean while rapidly approaching, and
                  distinctly heard his daughter say, "Oh Lud a mercy, it's papa, I dare say! I hope
                  he did not see us." </p><p> "I'll climb up these stones and peep," said the first
                  voice. </p><p> In a few seconds, a face appeared through the frame-work of the
                  window; and in less than in an instant the fragment of antiquity, in reality no
                  more firmly built than it was really meant to appear, yielded to the weight
                  imposed upon it, crumbled, fell, and carried with it to the ground the person in
                  question. </p><p> The scene fallen, the actors behind it became conspicuous; and
                  Miss Oxmondeley, Mr. Cranberry, and Rachel, appeared standing in various attitudes
                  of terror and surprise—Miss Emily and Alfred sitting on the grass, at a short
                  distance from the scene of action, and John Morden lying prostrate amongst the
                  ruined ruins. </p><p> "Here's a pretty spot of work!" cried the baronet, "the
                  mouldering walls of my abbey all in ruins!—How the devil came you to climb up it,
                  you imp of vexation?" </p><p> "Have you hurt yourself," said Eliza, advancing to
                  John. </p><p> "Oh, no!" said he, rising gently, while he held one hand on his
                  back, and rubbed his left knee with the other. </p><p> "If you had broken your
                  neck, I should not have pitied you," cried the baronet. </p><p> "If he had,"
                  returned Eliza, "it would have signified little to him, whether you had or
                  not—your compassion would be of much more consequence to him now, for I'm sure
                  he's hurt." </p><p> "Here's at your cock Robin, indeed!" exclaimed Sir Gilbert,
                  settling the flaps of his waistcoat with both his hands, and moving about his
                  fingers in painful agitation. </p><p> "Give me leave to introduce Mr. Cranberry to
                  you, papa." </p><p> Cranberry bowed, scraped, muttered a great deal, and said
                  nothing. </p><p> "How do you do, sir?" said Sir Gilbert impatiently.— "If it had
                  been my Chinese temple, instead of this ruin, I'd have broken your neck for you,
                  myself, puppy!" he continued, turning to John. </p><p> "Is there a Chinese-temple
                  in these gardens?" asked Cranberry with affected eagerness and pleasure. </p><pb
                  n="140"/><p> "Yes sir, yes sir," answered Sir Gilbert, placidity returning to his
                  bow. </p><p> Cranberry had already received his cue from Eliza, and now turning
                  quickly round to Rachel, exclaimed, "Oh, you cruel creature, not to point it out
                  to me, when you know my partiality for those buildings!" </p><p> John Morden,
                  advancing to Sir Gilbert, said, "I beg pardon, Sir Gilbert, but I thought those
                  mock ruins had always been built stronger." </p><p> "Well, well," said the
                  baronet, "it is some consolation that I can afford to build another." </p><p> "If
                  I might be allowed to speak," said Cranberry, "I think it gives the idea it was
                  meant to convey much more forcibly in its present state than it did before."
                  </p><p> "Indeed!" replied the baronet, "Surely not:" he gave a moment's pause to
                  observation, then added, "let me stand where you do a minute, sir, if you please."
                  </p><p> Eliza ran up to her father, and peeping over his shoulder, "Oh, decidedly,
                  decidedly," she cried. </p><p> "Decidedly, what?" asked the baronet. </p><p> "More
                  mutilated, papa," answered she. </p><p> "Oh, infinitely more ruinous and
                  dilapidated," added Cranberry. </p><p> "But my robin is lost," said Sir Gilbert,
                  with a sigh; "I don't like that."</p><p>"Ay, flown away," cried John, still
                  holding his knee; "it would have been a good thing for me, if I could have taken
                  wing like it:" a wink to Eliza and Cranberry followed this sentence. </p><p> "Why,
                  did you really think it was alive?" asked the baronet, with pleasure sparkling in
                  his eyes. </p><p> "Why was it not?" said John, with affected surprise. </p><p>
                  "Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed Sir Gilbert, unable to contain his extacy; "you were
                  really taken in then, ha! ha! ha! you are not the first that has been taken in
                  about that robin." </p><p> "No, nor the last neither," said Eliza, looking archly
                  at her companions. </p><p> "No, no, no," returned the baronet; "I can't help
                  laughing though at the thoughts of it;—I can easily have the ruin mended, and
                  another bird put up." </p><p> "Besides you can vary your subject, and the
                  deception will have the better effect," remarked Cranberry. </p><p> "True, sir,
                  true, so it will; those that have seen it before, will think the robin has flown
                  away, indeed," returned the baronet. </p><p> "But the Chinese temple, Sir
                  Gilbert—" </p><p> "I'm on the road to it now," answered the exulting baronet;
                  "walk you behind Eliza," continued he, "you have seen it often enough, and it is
                  not worth a pin, without you have a clear view of it breaking upon you from
                  amongst the trees;—walk on, sir, walk on, the path will lead you to it;" and on
                  they moved, Eliza and John rejoicing in the happy change John's maneuver had
                  worked on the baronet's temper. </p></quote>

            <p> We are sorry that we have not been more entertained with the whole of this novel:
               but we readily acknowledge that we have occasionally received pleasure from the comic
               powers of Mr. Lathom; and that we have met with scenes not unworthy of the drama,
               where the ridicule is well painted which resulted from pride, ostentation, and
               vanity, grafted on low birth, mean education, and defective intellects. Prolixity is
               the great fault of this author, and it is indeed too common an error. It is to be
               wished that writers of all descriptions would study the <hi rendition="#italics"
                  >multum in parvo</hi>,<note>Much matter within a small compass.</note> and the
               happy art of compressing. <hi rendition="#italics">How</hi> to <hi
                  rendition="#italics">begin</hi>, and <hi rendition="#italics">how</hi> to <hi
                  rendition="#italics">finish</hi>, are points of difficulty: but <hi
                  rendition="#italics">when</hi> to <hi rendition="#italics">finish</hi> requires
               the most resolution. </p>
