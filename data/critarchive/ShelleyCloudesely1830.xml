				<p>I<hi rendition="#smcaps">n</hi> his able preface to this work, <ref
						target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref> sets the writer of
					fiction in a very high place. He compares him with the historian and the
					dramatist, and gives him the preference. He says&#8212;and his late occupation
					of the History of the Commonwealth has informed him of the truth of the
					assertion&#8212;that &quot;individual history and biography are mere guesses in
					the dark.&quot; &quot;The writer collects his information of what the great men
					on the theatre of the world are reported to have said and done, and then
					endeavours with his best sagacity to find out the explanation; to hit on that
					thread, woven through the whole contexture of the piece, which, being
					discovered, we are told <quote>

						</lg></quote> But man is a more complex machine than is dreamed of in our
					philosophy, and it is probable that the skill of no moral anatomist has yet been
					consummate enough fully to solve the obscurities of any one of the great
					worthies of ancient or modern times.&quot; While the writer of fiction, <ref
						target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref> goes on to say,
					&quot;when he introduces his ideal personage to the public, enters upon the task
					with a preconception of the qualities that belong to this being, the principle
					of his actions and its concomitants. He has thus two advantages: in the first
					place, his express office is to draw just conclusions from assigned premises, a
					task of no extraordinary difficulty; and, secondly, while he endeavours to aid
					those conclusions by consulting the oracle in his bosom, the suggestions of his
					own heart, instructed as he is besides by a converse with the world, and a
					careful survey of the encounters that present themselves to his observation, he
					is much less liable to be cribbed and cabined in by those unlooked-for
					phenomena, which in the history of an individual seem to have a malicious
					pleasure in thrusting themselves forward to subvert the best digested theories.
					In this sense, then, it is infallibly true that fictitious history, when it is
					the work of a competent hand, is more to be depended upon, and comprises more of
					the science of man, than whatever can be exhibited by the historian.&quot; The
					writer of fiction, <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref>
					asserts, has besides many advantages over the dramatist; &quot;he has leisure to
					ripen his materials; to draw out his results one by one, even as they grow up
					and unfold themselves in the &apos;seven ages&apos; of man. He is not confined,
					like the dramatist, to put down the words that his characters shall utter. He
					accompanies the language made use of by them with his comments, and explains the
					inmost thoughts that pass in the bosom of the upright man and the
					perverse.&quot;</p>
				<p>Such, indeed, have been the characteristics of <ref
						target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref>&apos;s novels. While
					other writers represent manners rather than passions, or passions at once vague
					and incomplete, he conceives, in its entireness, the living picture of an event
					with all its adjuncts; he sets it down in its vivid reality: no part is dim, no
					part is tame. We have the clear and distinct representation of his conception,
					and are made to feel that his portraiture is endowed with the very essence and
					spirit of our nature. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Mr
						Bulwer</ref> had, in his delightful novel of
					&quot;<title>Pelham</title>,&quot; described his idea of a work of fiction.
					Story, he renders the subordinate. The almost common events of life are his
					groundwork; or where he mingles the romantic, it is made rather an episode than
					an intrinsic part of his machinery. <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton"
						>Mr Bulwer</ref> does not take the materials of the world around, first
					separating, and then, by aid of the inventive faculty, moulding them into a new
					form, whose exact appearance depends on a preconceived notion of what must be,
					to fulfil his idea; but he gives us rather himself, his experience, his
					opinions, his emotions. The high-wrought and <fw type="vol" place="bottom-left"
							><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. xxvii. no. clxv.</hi></fw><milestone
						unit="signature" n="3 A" rendition="#smcaps"/><pb n="712"/>noble tone of his
					mind spreads a sacred and even mysterious grandeur over his pages. His wit
					enlivens them, his acute observations and peculiar and beautiful power of
					poetically linking the apparently dissimilar by their real similitudes, are the
					value and charm of his works.</p>
				<p>But though <ref target="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Mr Bulwer</ref>’s
					exceeding talent exalts this species of compostition, it is not in itself of so
					high a grade as the other, which in fact almost infringes on the ideality of the
					drama by a sort of unity, wanting, in what we may call in comparison with this
					the &quot;narrative,&quot; the &quot;didactic novel.&quot; The temple which
					presents to our eyes the proportions and harmonious accords of architecture, is
					a finer production than a rambling palace, though the apartments of the latter
					may be more glittering, lustrous, and delightful. There seems in our human
					nature a necessity of self-restraint, before we can reach the highest kind of
					excellence. If simplicity is the best,&#8212;if those, <quote>

					example they cannot be, for their characteristic is, that they are genuine and
					untaught. Putting, therefore, these out of the question, I repeat, that a
					certain degree of obedience to rule and law is necessary for the completion and
					elevation of our nature and its productions. Of all writers, <ref
						target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref>, whom the ignorant
					have deemed irregular, is the closest follower of these laws, for he has always
					a scope and an aim, which, beyond every other writer, he fulfils. The merely
					copying from our own hearts will no more form a first-rate work of art, than
					will the most exquisite representation of mountains, water, wood, and glorious
					clouds, form a good painting, if none of the rules of grouping or colouring are
					followed. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</ref> has not
					attained this master art; his wonderful genius developes itself in individual
					characters and scenes, unsurpassed, except by <ref
						target="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</ref>, for energy and
					truth; but his wholes want keeping&#8212;often even due connexion.</p>
				<p>Of all modern writers, <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref>
					has arrived most sedulously, and most successfully, at the highest species of
					perfection his department of art affords. He sketches in his own mind, with a
					comprehensive and bold imagination, the plan of his work; he digs at the
					foundations, and learns all the due bearings of his position; he examines his
					materials, and sees exactly to what purpose each is best fitted; he makes an
					incident; he unerringly divines the results, both of the event and passion,
					which this incident will bring forth. By dint of the mastery of thought, he
					transfuses himself into the very souls of his personages; he dives into their
					secret hearts, and lays bare, even to their anatomy, their workings; not a
					pulsation escapes him,&#8212;while yet all is blended into one whole, which
					forms the pervading impulse of the individual he brings before us. Who,
					remembering Falkland, but feels as if he had stood by that noble ruin, and
					watching its downfall! Who but writhes under the self-dejection of Mandeville,
					and feels the while his own heart whisper fearful oracles of the tameless and
					sad incongruities of our souls! Who but exulted madly with St Leon, when he
					obtained his specious gifts! We pass with their creator into the very form and
					frame of his creatures: our hearts swell responsive to every emotion he
					delineates. When we heard of another tale by the same author, we wondered what
					new magic circle was traced, within which we were to stand side by side with the
					enchanter, seeing the spirits that rise to his call, enthralled by the spell he
					casts over us.</p>
				<p><title>Cloudesley</title> is before us, a fresh example of what we have been
					saying. This tale contains a train of events, each naturally flowing one<pb
						n="713"/> from the other, and each growing in importance and dignity as they
					proceed. We have no extraneous ornaments; no discursive flights. Comparing this
					book with others, we felt as if we had quitted gardens and parks, and tamer
					landscapes, for a scene on nature&apos;s grandest scale; that we wandered among
					giants&apos; rocks, &quot;the naked bones of the world waiting to be
						clothed.&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><ref

							Letter V. </note></hi> We use this quotation, because it suggested
					itself to our minds as we read these volumes, but we must guard our meaning from
					the idea of there being any turgidness in <title>Cloudesley</title>. Grace and
					dignity, joined to power, are its characteristics. The first volume is the least
					interesting. The author digs at the foundation, and then places the first
					stones; then we begin to feel the just proportions and promising beauty of the
					plan, till the tantalizing work of preparation finally yields to the full
					manifestation of the conception of the artist. If we may be permitted another
					metaphor, and this last is the most just, we will say that this work reminds us
					of the solemn strain of some cathedral organ. First, a few appropriate chords
					are fitfully and variously struck; a prelude succeeds to awaken our attention,
					and then rises the full peal, which swells upon the ear, till the air appears
					overcharged and overflowing with majestic harmonies. As far as an image can go,
					this exactly pourtrays our sensations on reading <title>Cloudesley</title>. The
					composer rapts us from ourselves, filling our bosoms with new and extraordinary
					emotions, while we sit soul-enchained by the wonders of his art.</p>
				<p>The story of Cloudesley is of the younger brother of a nobleman, placed under
					peculiarly tempting circumstances, on the death of his elder, of his concealing
					that elder&apos;s new-born heir, and so stepping into the place and honours of
					the orphan. We have here three prominent characters;&#8212;the guilty uncle, his
					agent, who conceals and brings up the child, and the child himself. The contrast
					of these situations and characters produces a group matchless for interest,
					while the circumstances that grow out of the first committed fraud, are the
					influences that mould these characters at will. The conflicting emotions of the
					uncle are first brought forward, and then the remorse that quickly follows his
					crime. Remorse it may emphatically be called, and not repentance, since he does
					not desire to repair the injuries he has committed: a carking, self-consuming
					bitterness of spirit. He hates himself&#8212;but no love for another engenders a
					generous return to right. He finds himself the very dupe of ambition;&#8212;he
					wished to be the peer he would naturally have become, had his brother died
					childless,&#8212;so he puts aside the child, and assumes his station in the
					world, and then finds that he is not what he expected to be. Not the noble, the
					gentleman of vast possessions, inheritor of a spotless name; not the lineal
					successor to honours and power, such as thousands would envy. This, indeed, he
					appears in the eyes of the world, but in his own heart, he knows himself to be
					the opposite of this. He is a robber, a swindler, a villain; he would exchange
					back all for his former innocence, but his terror of infamy is greater than his
					love for virtue, and he clings tenaciously to the fruits of his crime, as the
					sole compensation for the consciousness of guilt. Remorse is at first a trifling
					punishment. God&apos;s justice follows in the premature deaths of his own
					children, and the loss of his beloved wife: he feels the finger of the Eternal
					marking with torturous traces in his soul the judgement due to crime.</p>
				<p>More slowly&#8212;for he has no instinct of nature to quicken his
					emotions&#8212;the agent of the false uncle, Cloudesley, awakes to penitence.
					Remorse in the brother was inspired by the injury he had done the dead, in
					Cloudesley, by that inflicted on the living. In the former it was a barren
					feeling, wasting the soul; in the latter, quickened into life by the spirit of
					love, it grows into an earnest desire to repair the wrongs in which he took
					part. Thus he devotes himself to the preservation and education of the orphan
					boy. And here we have the third personage. The description of the bringing up of
					the injured outcast child, is replete with grace, and with many a lesson to be
					conned by parents, and followed by preceptors. Time rolls on, bringing to
					maturity these seeds<pb n="714"/> of events, these various elements of passion
					and of action, until there grows up before one’s eyes their natural results,
					recorded by the hand of truth, graced by the charms of imagination. </p>
				<p>At first Cloudesley&apos;s penitence manifests itself by the exemplary attention
					and affection which he bestows on his charge. He is a father to him in
					appearance; in reality, almost more, being tutor and servant at the same time,
					as he is the protector. He considers the injured offspring of his early and kind
					patron as a being superior to himself, whom he reverences as well as loves. As
					the boy grows up, he becomes more keenly alive to the injustice done him. He
					remonstrates with the usurper by letter, vainly. The only effect of his epistle
					is to increase the wretchedness of the successful criminal, not to change his
					intents. At last he visits him in person, and their interview is a
					highly-wrought scene of passionate eloquence. Still the uncle is obdurate.
					Cloudesley educated his ward in Italy. He had to travel far northward to seek
					his false relative. He leaves the boy, the nursling of love, on whose ear no
					unkind or harsh work had ever grated, under the guardianship of a man whose
					integrity, strangely blended with rudeness, renders him a very unfitting
					supplier of his place. This event brings on the catastrophe. We will not mar its
					interest by a lame abridgement. It is the peculiar excellence of <ref
						target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref>&apos;s writing, that
					there is not a word too much, and curtailment of the narrative would be like
					displaying the unfilled-up outline of beauty; we might feel that it was there,
					and yet remain in ignorance of its peculiar features. The interest is
					imperative, but unconstrained; nature dwells paramount in every part. As it
					proceeds, it becomes high-wrought, without being harrowing. To the end, the
					tragedy is tempered by the softest spirit of humanity; it touches the verge of
					terror, only to bring us the more soothingly back to milder feelings. We close
					the book, not tantalized by a sense of the injustice of fate, nor tormented by a
					painful depicting of unrebuked guilt, but with a compassion for the criminal,
					and a love or admiration for the innocent, at once elevating and delightful. The
					few last pages are indeed a record of truths and sentiments, which, as coming
					from one who has lived so long, and, synonymous with this expression, suffered
					so much, inculcates a philosophy very opposite from the misanthropical one so
					prevalent a little while ago.</p>
				<p><ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Mr Godwin</ref>&apos;s style is at once
					simple and energetic; it is full, without being inflated. We turn over the pages
					to seek an impressive passage, but it is difficult to find one sufficiently
					disconnected with the story, to quote. The description of the feelings of the
					unhappy deceived man of ambition, when he first finds himself fully entered on
					the path of guilt, is full of eloquence. Thus he speaks: <quote><p>It was my
							determination to return with all practicable speed to the British
							dominions. I loathed the country which had been the scene of these
							recent events. They had succeeded each other with such rapidity, as to
							confound my apprehension. I felt as if I had a load of guilt on my soul,
							almost too vast and overpowering for human ability to endure. My
							feelings were those of a murderer! And yet I had committed no murder.
							Could I not with a safe conscience assure myself that I had in no way
							been a party to the destruction of Arthur, or of Irene? Their child was
							not dead. But he was by my means civilly dead to his property, his rank,
							and his country. I had determined that he should be an outcast,
							belonging to no one, an uncertain and solitary wanderer on the face of
							nature!</p>
						<p>Oh! how I detested myself in the recollection of the base and
							hypocritical scene that I had caused to be played in the presence of the
							corpse of Irene! I had laid by her chaste and spotless side, the corpse
							of a child, the offspring of disgrace and infamy! I have often read that
							the blood of a murdered man would flow anew from his veins the instant
							his body was touched by the finger of his murderer. Well might I have
							expected that the hapless Irene should start again into life with
							indignation at the lie I imposed upon her, the contamination with which
							I approached her. She was certainly dead! If the smallest particle of
							perception had remained in any portion of her frame, it would have
							shrunk and shuddered on this dreadful occasion. I had tried the question
							to its utmost. I had never seen death till now. Never was such a
							penetrating <pb n="715"/> trial, such a demonstrative ordeal of its
							reality, devised by man. Her features were calm; there was a sweet and
							complacent serenity on her countenance. She was turned to earth. (Vol.
							ii p. 38.)</p>
						<p>I was alone in my carriage as I traversed Germany from Vienna to Ostend,
							or worse than alone, with my valet in the same vehicle to speak when he
							was spoken to, and do as he was directed. I traversed in my route many
							extensive forests and many sandy and dismal plains. My journey was made
							in the blackest and most naked season of the year. Dark clouds were
							perpetually hurried along the horizon, and the air was nipping and
							severe. I seldom slept in my carriage, but was left to the uncomfortable
							communion of my own thoughts. I slept not, but was lost in long and
							vague reveries, unconscious how the time passed, but feeling that it was
							insupportably monotonous and tedious. My mind was in that state in which
							a man has an undefined feeling that he exists, but in which his
							sensations rarely shape themselves into any thing that deserves the name
							of thought.</p>
						<p>In this situation, particularly when the shades of evening began to
							prevail, and in the twilight, my senses were bewitched, and I seemed to
							see a multitude of half-formed visions. Once, especially, as I passed
							through a wood by moonlight, I suddenly saw my brother's face looking
							out from among the trees as I passed. I saw the features as distinctly
							as if the meridian sun had beamed upon them. The countenance was as
							white as death, and the expression was past speaking pitiful. It was by
							degrees that the features shewed themselves thus out of what had been a
							formless shadow. I gazed upon it intently. Presently, it faded away by
							as insensible degrees as those by which it had become thus agonizingly
							clear. After a short time it returned. I saw also Irene and the child,
							living and dead, and then living again. No tongue can tell what I
							endured on these occasions. It was a delirium and confusion and
							agitation that continued for hours. The fits were not periodical. If I
							had a visitation of this kind at night, that afforded no security that
							it would not return in the morning, and again at noon. My appetite
							deserted me, my eyes became fiery and bloodshot. (Vol ii. p. 45.) </p>
					</quote></p>
				<p> We lingered to select another extract from many beautiful passages, containing
					descriptions first of the domestic happiness, and then of the misfortunes, of
					the usurper: we feel inclined to take instead, the description of the injured
					boy himself, as containing one of the sweetest pictures of educated, civilized
					youth we ever remember to have read: <quote><p>In the various pursuits,
							therefore, of classical studies and the English language, in a word, of
							every thing adapted to his years, the progress of Julian was at this
							time astonishingly rapid. In the course of the next six or seven years,
							he shook off every thing that was childish and puerile, without
							substituting in its stead the slightest tincture of pedantry. The
							frankness and nobility of his spirit defended him from all danger on
							that side. The constitution of his nature was incapable of combining
							itself with any alloy of the fop or the coxcomb. All his motions were
							free, animated, and elastic. They sprung into being instant, and as by
							inspiration, without waiting to demand the sanction of the deliberative
							faculty. They were born perfect, as <ref target="people.html#Minerva"
								>Minerva</ref> is feigned to have sprung in complete panoply from
							the head of <ref target="people.html#Jupiter">Jove</ref>. The sentiments
							of his mind unfolded themselves, without trench or wrinkle, in his
							honest countenance and impassioned features. Into that starry region no
							disguise could ever intrude; and the clear and melodious tones of his
							voice were a transparent medium to the thoughts of his heart. Persuasion
							hung on all he said, and it was next to impossible that the most rugged
							nature and the most inexorable spirit should dispute his bidding. And
							this was the case, because all he did was in love, in warm affection, in
							a single desire for the happiness of those about him. Every one hastened
							to perform his behests, because the idea of empire and command never
							entered into his thoughts. He seemed as if he lived in a world made
							expressly for him, so precisely did all with whom he came into contact
							appear to form their tone on his.</p>
						<p>And, in the midst of all his studies and literary improvement, he in no
							wise neglected any of that bodily dexterity by which he had been early
							distinguished. His mastery in swimming, in handling the dart and the
							bow, in swiftness of foot, and in wrestling, kept pace with his other
							accomplishments. Nor was his corporal strength any way behind his other
							endowments. He could throw the discus higher and farther than any of his
							competitors. But his greatest excellence in this kind was in
							horsemanship. He sprang from the ground like a bird, as if his natural
							quality had been to mount into the air. He vaulted into his seat like an
							angel that had descended into it from the conveyance of a sunbeam. He
							had a favourite horse, familiar, as it were,<pb n="716"/> with all the
							thoughts of his rider, and that shewed himself pleased and proud of the
							notice of the noble youth. He snorted, and bent his neck in the most
							graceful attitudes, and beat the ground with his hoofs, and shewed
							himself impatient for the signal to leave the goal, and start into his
							utmost speed. Julian was master of his motions. He would stop, and wind,
							and exhibit all his perfection of paces, with a whisper, or the lifting
							of a finger, from him whose approbation excited in the animal the
							supremest delight. In a word, Julian won the favour of his elders by the
							clearness of his apprehension, and his progress in every thing that was
							taught him; and of his equals, by his excellence in all kinds of sport
							and feats of dexterity, which could be equalled only by the modesty, the
							good humour, and accommodating spirit, with which he bore his honours,
							rendering others almost as well satisfied with his superiority as if the
							triumph had been their own. (Vol. ii p. 184.)</p></quote></p>
