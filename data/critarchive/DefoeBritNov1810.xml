               <hi rendition="#largest">T</hi>HE first publication which
                    appears in this selection has so little the air of a common novel, that many
                    will probably be surprised to see it included under that denomination; and some,
                    who consider their old friend <title>

                            Crusoe</hi>
               </title> as a mere school-boy acquaintance, may wonder to see
                    him in such good company as the <ref target="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charleses</ref> and the <ref target="people.html#WilliamsBetty">Lady
                        Betties</ref> of fashionable life. But the truth is, this favourite of our
                    early years, though it has no pretensions to the graces of style, nor aims at
                    touching the tender passions, yields to few in the truth of its description and
                    its power of interesting the mind. Its author, <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">D<hi rendition="#smcaps">aniel de </hi>F<hi rendition="#smcaps">oe</hi>
               </ref>, is a name well known in the political
                    history of his age. He was born in London in 1663; his father was a butcher; his
                    education was a common one, and none of his works bear any marks of that polish
                    and elegance of style which is the mingled result of a classical education, and
                    of associating with the more cultivated orders of society: but he was a man of a
                    truly original genius, and possessed in a remarkable degree the power of giving
                    such an air of truth and nature to his narrations that <fw type="vol" rendition="#smcaps" place="bottom-left">vol. xvi.</fw>
               <milestone unit="signature" n="a" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="ii"/>they are rather
                    deceptions than imitations. In that particular cast of his genius he resembled
                        <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, his antipodes in
                    politics and religion. The talent of grave irony, and the attention to those
                    minute circumstances, those apparently undersigned touches, which cause the
                    reader to exclaim, "No man could surely have thought of this if it had not
                    been true," were alike in both. To the <hi rendition="#italics">humour</hi>
                    of <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> had no pretensions. This
                    author was educated a dissenter, and was greatly attached to the cause of
                    liberty and protestantism: he was early in life engaged in the unfortunate
                    rebellion of the <ref target="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">duke of
                        Monmouth</ref>, but had the good fortune to escape the severe vengeance
                    which was exercised after his defeat, and to return unmolested to London, where
                    he followed his business of a maker of bricks and pantiles. He was not however
                    successful, and became insolvent; but he honourably paid his creditors as soon
                    as his circumstances enabled him so to do. From this period he attracted great
                    notice as a writer by a number of publications, chiefly political, which came
                    from his pen. One of them, entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The shortest
                            Way with the Dissenters</hi>
               </title>, drew upon him a severe punishment.
                    It was written in 1702, when the high-church party were inclined to persecute
                    the sectaries. The grave ironical style in which it was written, at first
                    deceived the public, and many thought him in earnest. The same thing is said to
                    have happened to <ref target="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</ref>, on the
                    publication of his <title>

                    contained the fiction of a club discussing various topics of a miscellaneous
                    nature, which in all probability gave the hint to <ref target="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</ref> and <ref target="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</ref> for the frame they used

                    employed by the <ref target="people.html#AnneQueenofGreatBritain">queen</ref> in
                    Scotland, when the union was projected. He had great knowledge of affairs of
                    commerce and revenue, on which subjects he was often consulted. After the union
                    had taken place, he wrote the history of it in a folio volume. It seems strange
                    that one so much employed as he was at that time should obtain no settled
                    provision; and still more, that upon the accession of <ref target="people.html#ageorgeIIKingofGreatBritain">George the Second</ref>,
                    when the whigs were again in power, he was not rewarded for his sufferings in
                    the cause of liberty civil and religious, a cause he certainly <milestone unit="signature" n="a 2" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="iv"/> had at heart. But
                    it is to be feared his integrity was not quite equal to his abilities, and he
                    had given offence by some publications which were at least ambiguous, and laid
                    him open to the censure of writing on both sides. He seems therefore from this
                    time to have given up politics, and to have employed his pen in composing those
                    works by which his name has been best known to posterity. Among these were his
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Family Instructor</hi>

                  <hi rendition="#italics">Religious Courtship</hi>
               </title>. They
                    both consist of dialogues on religious and moral subjects, relative to the
                    conduct of life in its various situations and occurrencess. They have not the
                    least pretensions to elegance, and an air of religious austerity pervades the
                    whole of them; but their dramatic form of dialogues, supported with much nature
                    and feeling, and the interest which his manner of writing has thrown into the
                    familiar stories and incidents of domestic and common life, has made these
                    publications, especially the former, exceedingly popular to this day among those
                    whose religious opinions are similar to his own. <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> also wrote <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">A Journal of the Plague Year</hi>
               </title>. It is
                    written in the person of a citizen, a shopkeeper, who is supposed to have staid
                    in the metropolis during the whole time of the calamity; and the particulars are
                    so striking, so awful, and so circumstantial, that it deceived most of his
                    readers, and amongst others it is said Dr. Mead, into a belief of its
                    authenticity;—an exercise of ingenuity not to be commended;—though,
                    after all, the particulars were probably most of them true, though the relater
                    was fictitious. <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> also wrote
                    many <pb n="v"/>pieces in verse, which, though they had no pretensions to poetry
                    properly so called, had many passages that were nervous and pointed. One,
                    entitled <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Reformation of Manners</hi>
               </title>,
                    contains a strong invective against the slave-trade. A satire called <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The true-born Englishman</hi>
               </title> was much read
                    in its time, though it gave great offence. Its purport was to parry the attacks
                    made against <ref target="people.html#WilliamIIIKingofEngland">king
                        William</ref> as a foreigner, by showing that the English themselves were a
                    very mixed breed, who had no purity of blood to boast of.—But the work by
                    which this writer is best known, both at home and abroad, is that which is
                    presented to the public in this selection, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The
                            Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.</hi>
               </title>
            </p>
            <p> It has been translated into most modern languages, has passed through numberless
                    editions, and has always been found particularly agreeable to the taste of
                    youth. The story turns upon the ingenuity and contrivance with which a solitary
                    being, wrecked upon a desert island, provides for his subsistence, and by
                    degrees supplies himself with all the most desirable accommodations of life. The
                    reader is wonderfully delighted to see him acquire one comfort after another,
                    and grows at length almost in love with his solitude. Some have thought the
                    author has shortened his labour too much by allowing him so many articles out of
                    the ship; but without them the story, though it might have displayed more
                    mechanical invention, would have gone on rather heavily. Besides the ingenuity
                    of contrivance displayed in this work, there are many circumstances which
                    strongly <pb n="vi"/> affect the feelings. The terror inspired by the impression
                    of the <hi rendition="#italics">foot in the sand</hi>; the luminous eyes,
                    glaring like two lamps, at the bottom of the cave; and the affectionate
                    simplicity of poor Friday, agitate the mind in various ways. The latter has a
                    great deal of simple and natural pathos; and nothing in description can be more
                    lively than the account of his meeting with his old father, who is saved from
                    the cannibals, and of the fond and animated expressions of his affection to him
                    both then, and when he meets him again on the island. </p>
            <p> A strong tincture of religious feeling runs through the work, not unmixed with
                    superstition. Dreams, omens, and impressions on the mind occur, in which <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> was either a believer, or at
                    least he knew how to take advantage of them in impressing his readers. That he
                    was not very scrupulous in this point, appears from the following
                        anecdote:—<hi rendition="#italics">Drelincourt on Death</hi>, a grave
                    religious book, not going off so well as the booksellers wished, they applied,
                    it is said, to <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> to write
                    something which might give it a lift; for which purpose he composed <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Apparition of Mrs. Veal</hi>
               </title>. Though
                    pure invention, it was told in so natural and circumstantial a way, that it
                    gained credit with hundreds of readers; and being prefixed to the work, the
                    impression sold rapidly.—It is said that <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Robinson Crusoe</hi>
               </title> has given many a boy a predilection for a
                    seafaring life; which is not unlikely; for the variety of adventures it contains
                    kindles curiosity, and even when the subject of them is in his most forlorn and
                    solitary state, there is something gratifying <pb n="vii"/> to the imagination
                    in contemplating him as king and owner of every thing about him; <quote>

               </quote> Among the striking passages of the work may be mentioned the encounter
                    with the wolves and bears in crossing the Pyrenees. The second part, like most
                    second parts, is much inferior to the first. We lose our old acquaintance the
                    Solitary, and are presented with a Missionary in his stead. The story is
                    confused with a variety of adventures, in which however the author exhibits his
                    knowledge of the course of trade, which he was well acquainted with, and manners
                    and customs which he had heard or read of, in China, Tartary, Siberia, and other
                    countries. The most striking passage in this volume is the lively description of
                    the sufferings of a young woman dying in the agonies of hunger. <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> has shown a candour, at that
                    time not very common, in giving a very amiable character of a French catholic
                    priest; but the adventure of burning the Tartar idol, if it is meant as a heroic
                    exploit, shows very confused ideas of justice.—It must not be concealed
                    that the originality of this work has been disputed to <ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref> from the following
                    circumstance. One <ref target="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Alexander
                        Selkirk</ref> really passed some years alone on the island of Juan
                    Fernandez, and a sketch of his story had been given in the relation of <ref target="people.html#RogersWoodes">Woodes Rogers</ref>. This might very
                    probably give the first hint of his romance; but as to the report that <pb n="viii"/> he possessed papers of <ref target="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Selkirk</ref>'s and had made unacknowledged use of them, it appears to
                    have been propagated without any solid ground whatever; and indeed the situation
                    in which Robinson Crusoe is placed, and from which most of the incidents arise,
                    materially differs from that of <ref target="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Selkirk</ref>.—<ref target="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</ref>
                    wrote many other lives and adventures, and employed his ready pen to the end of
                    his laborious life, which took place in London, in April 1731, in his 68th year.
