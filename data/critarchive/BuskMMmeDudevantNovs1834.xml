					combination with their <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">author</ref>,
					constitute a moral phenomenon, perhaps not one of the least remarkable of these
					our phenomenon-teeming days. The points co-operating to the construction of this
					phenomenon are of course multifarious. One is, the inconceivable discrepancy,
					and that of an unwonted kind, between the earlier and later productions of one
					and the same <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">author</ref>. The first two
					works, but especially the first, of the <hi rendition="#italics">soi-disant<note>So-called.</note></hi><ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">George Sand</ref>, were so replete with
					talent and with knowledge of human nature, so boldly conceived and so
					brilliantly executed,—were written in a style so animated, so graphically
					delightful, displayed portraits hit off with such admirable power and
					spirit,—even if not always wrought out in the conduct of the story in perfect
					keeping with the original sketch,—as we have rarely seen surpassed. Gladly did
					we hail them, as harbingers of the rising of a new and radiant, if not perfectly
					salutiferous star, above the literary horizon. The succeeding works published
					under the same name, far from showing the improved mastery of the art usually
					acquired by practice,<pb n="272"/>are, as though the mine had been thus quickly
					exhausted, so immeasurably inferior to their predecessors in every thing,
					(except, perhaps, boldness of conception, which now sometimes increases from
					originality to extravagance,) that but for their similarity of tone and temper,
					we should hardly know how to credit their fraternal relationship. If we are
					indeed to believe that <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">George Sand</ref> is
					one individual, and not two or more individuals,—we look not upon the J. once
					substituted for the G. as any argument, because, to say nothing of public
					opinion, <title><hi rendition="#italics">Lelia</hi></title>, to which we chiefly allude, bears the G.—we cannot suggest, for the
					unriddling of the mystery, a better key than the remark of a shrewd and witty
					friend of our own youth, who was wont to say, "It is when a man has got a bad
					name that he may go to sleep, since nothing he can do will ever change it; when
					he has a good one, he must labor like a horse to keep it." Of a surety <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">George Sand</ref> agrees not with our
					friend, but having deserved and gained a high—a very high—literary reputation,
					fancies he may go to sleep, and fearlessly publish the somnambulic effusions of
					his repose.</p><p>The second point is, that even those novels which we rank highest in the scale, <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> and <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title>, although not actually immoral, certainly not licentious, are often so
					daring in situation and in graphic delineation, are so generally deficient in
					refined delicacy, in glowing love of, and delight in, virtue, that we should
					hesitate about recommending even these to our fair and youthful readers. It may
					be thought that in the present state of French literature, at least in the
					departments of the drama and of prose fiction, this want of delicacy and of
					moral sense rather detracts from than enhances the singularity we have ascribed
					to the productions before us; but the reader will possibly abandon that opinion
					when informed of our third point, to wit, that <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">George Sand</ref> is only a <hi rendition="#italics">pseudonyme</hi>, and that the real <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">author</ref> of them is a lady, and a lady
					(as we have been informed, but cannot vouch) of unblemished character, whose
					name is <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame Dudevant</ref>.</p><p>The astonishment created by the discovery of the sex and individuality of the
					writer augments an hundred, nay, a million-fold, as we peruse the subsequent
					writings of the same highly, but perversely endowed <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref>, who, in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Lelia</hi></title>, seems almost ignorant, and quite reckless, of the difference between
					right and wrong. The most favourable hypothesis we can frame respecting our
					disguised lady is, that having been harshly treated by society, and especially
					unfortunate in the conjugal relation, she has been exasperated into the
					determined hostility to both, which, despite her protestations to the contrary,
					her publications exhibit, and in the irritation of unhappiness has lost the
					sensitive pudicity of her sex.</p><p>But we cannot expect our readers to go along with us in these<pb n="273"/>generalities. To enable them to do so, we must enter into particulars, and we
					believe the only way of unfolding our phenomenon will be to give short sketches
					of, and an extract or two from, all these tales. But in order to give the <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref> fair play, we will begin
					with extracts from the prefaces. In that to <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> she says —</p><quote><p>The narrator hopes that after hearing his tale to the end, few auditors will
						deny the <hi rendition="#italics">morality</hi> which results from his
						facts, and there, as in all that is human, is triumphant. As he finished it,
						he felt his conscience clear, and judged that the legal code which here upon
						earth must regulate the throbbing of man's bosom, ought in fairness to
						acquit him. He flatters himself that he has related without rancour the
						paltry miseries of society, has described without too much passion the
						passions of humanity. . . .</p><p>Perhaps you will do him justice if you allow that he has shown you the being
						who strives to get rid of a legitimate curb very wretched, the heart that
						revolts against the decrees of fate very desolate. If he has not assigned
						the fairest part to the one of his personages who represents <hi rendition="#italics">law</hi>, if he has shown under a still less lively
						aspect him who represents <hi rendition="#italics">opinion,</hi> you will
						see a third who represents <hi rendition="#italics">illusion,</hi> and who
						cruelly mocks and disappoints the vain hopes, the wild enterprises of
						passion. In short, you will see, that if he has not strewed roses on the
						ground where the law pens the wills of men, like the appetites of sheep, he
						has thrown nettles upon the path that leads from it.</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *</p><p>Indiana is woman, the feeble being commissioned to represent the <hi rendition="#italics">passions oppressed</hi>, or, if you like it better,
							<hi rendition="#italics">repressed</hi> by the <hi rendition="#italics">laws;</hi> here is will struggling with necessity; here is love dashing
						his blind brow against all the obstacles of civilization. But the serpent
						wears and breaks his teeth in striving to gnaw a file; the soul exhausts its
						energies in wrestling with the positive of life.</p></quote><p>Against this statement, we must be allowed to set a sort of aphoristic
					exclamation in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title>, which, not being assigned to any personage in the novel, must be taken
					as expressing the writer's own opinion.</p><quote><p>Poor woman, poor society, where the heart can find no genuine enjoyment, save
						in the forgetfulness of all duty, of all reason!</p></quote><p>But on the other hand, in the preface to <title><hi rendition="#italics">Le Secretaire Intime</hi></title>, <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame Dudevant</ref> has again
					vindicated or explained her views, and from this vindication or explanation,
					likewise, we are bound in justice to offer extracts.</p><quote><p>The author deems it his duty to declare, that he never meant to draw up an
						indictment against society, against the institutions by which it is
						governed, against humanity itself, as has been recently asserted. Intentions
						of this sort would ill become him; neither his talent, nor his will, nor yet
						his hopes, deserve so serious an impeachment. He well knows that the
						majority value highly institutions which they find<pb n="274"/>convenient,
						and, thank God, pride and folly have not yet bewildered him so far, as to
						induce the belief that a word of his could overthrow what exists. . . .
						.</p><p><title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> and <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title> are not then a satire against marriage, but pictures true or false
						(that the reader must decide) of the moral sufferings inflicted upon a
						delicate and pure soul by imperious brutality and by polished egotism. As
						marriage and love may very well exist independently of these two conditions,
						the poetical truth of the picture has nothing to do with the institutions
						and the passions that serve to frame it.</p></quote><p>This last sentence seems to refer to the <hi rendition="#italics">Secretaire
						Intime</hi> itself, of which hereafter. We now turn to the earlier novels;
					and as <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> is that in which the ticklish situations are managed with the nearest
					approach to delicacy, and is in every respect our favourite, we shall devote our
					principal attention to it.</p><p><title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> is the story of a marriage, unhappy from difference of age, station,
					opinions, feelings, disposition, in short, every thing in which contrariety is
					most inimical to happiness in the intimate association of wedlock. The husband
					is a surly half-pay veteran of the imperial army, low-born, uneducated, violent,
					jealous, and infirm; the wife, a noble Creole of Spanish race, lovely and good,
					with all the unregulated sensibility, or shall we say susceptibility? of
					tropical climates. She deems that she does her duty fully to the disagreeable
					partner of her life and master of her destiny, by personal fidelity and coldly
					implicit obedience, without an effort either to care for him, or to soothe and
					soften him into an object of, at least, respect and kindliness. She, Indiana,
					falls in love with a hero, whom, as a somewhat novel character, we must let the
						<ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref> herself paint. Her
					portrait of him displays that intermixture of general satirical touches in which
					she excels.</p><quote><p>M. Raymon de Ramière was neither a coxcomb nor a libertine. . . . He was a
						man of principle, when he reasoned with himself. But impetuous passions
						often hurried him out of his systems. <hi rendition="#italics">Then</hi> he
						was no longer capable of reflexion, or he avoided summoning himself to the
						bar of his own conscience; he committed faults, unknown, as it were, to
						himself, and the man of yesterday exerted himself to deceive the man of
						tomorrow. . . . . Raymon had the art of being often guilty without making
						himself hated, often capricious without being offensive. He occasionally
						succeeded in obtaining the pity of those who had most cause for being angry
						with him.</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *                *                *</p><p>Raymon was an exception from the rule, that he who speaks eloquently of his
						love is little in love. He expressed his passion skilfully, and felt it
						fervently. Only it was not his passion that made him eloquent, it was his
						eloquence that fired his passion. He took a fancy to a woman; he became
						eloquent to seduce her, and, whilst seducing, became desperately enamoured
						of her. . . . Raymon had committed for<pb n="275"/>love what are called
							follies.<note>Not crimes, observe. Is that illustrative of the state of
							Parisian society? [<ref target="people.html#BuskMary">Busk</ref>'s
							note.]</note> He had run away with a young lady of condition (and still
						is a bachelor); he had compromised women of high rank; he had fought two or
						three celebrated duels; he had betrayed the disorder of his heart, the
						delirium of his thoughts, to a whole rout, a whole theatre. A man who does
						all this without fear of being laughed at or execrated, and who succeeds in
						escaping both,<note>Being laughed at, perhaps; if he escaped their curses,
							his loves must have been of a kind not to require very artful seduction.
								[<ref target="people.html#BuskMary">Busk</ref>'s note.]</note> is
						thenceforth invulnerable; he may risk every thing, hope every thing.</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *                *                *</p><p>Raymon possessed inconceivable power over all that surrounded him, for with
						all his faults, he was a superior man in society. . . . . He was one of the
						men who have held most empire, most influence over your thoughts, whatever
						may be your opinion now. You have devoured his political pamphlets, and
						often have you been hurried away, whilst reading the newspapers of those
						days, by the irresistible charm of his style, by the graces of his
						courteous, his worldly argumentation.</p><p>I speak to you of an era already far distant from us, who no longer reckon by
						centuries, or even by reigns, but by ministers. I speak to you of the
						Martignac year<note>Jean Baptiste Gay, vicomte de Martignac (1778-1832) was
							Prime Minister of France from 1828-1829.</note>. . . . .</p><p>Placed by his birth and fortune amongst the partizans of absolute royalty,
						Raymon sacrificed to the <hi rendition="#italics">young</hi> ideas of his
						day by a devoted attachment to the Charter. At least he thought he did so,
						and laboured to prove it. But conventions that have fallen to desuetude are
						subject to various interpretations, and this was already the case with <ref target="people.html#LouisXVIIIKingofFrance">Louis XVIII</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">Charte</hi>, as with the Gospel of Christ. . . .
						Raymon, like other inexperienced heads, fancied it still possible to be a
						conscientious journalist. Error! At a season when deference to the voice of
						reason is only pretended, in order the more effectually to stifle it. Free
						from political passions, Raymon believed he was disinterested, and deceived
						himself; for society, as then organized, was to him favourable and
						advantageous; it could not be deranged without lessening the sum of his
						enjoyments, and that perfect quietude of situation, which extends to the
						thoughts, is a wonderful teacher of moderation.</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *                *                *</p><p>Preserved by his fortune from the necessity of writing for bread, Raymon used
						his pen from inclination, and (as he said and believed) from duty. His rare
						power of refuting positive truth by sheer talent rendered him invaluable to
						the ministry,—whom he served better by his impartial resistance, than did
						its creatures by their blind devotion,—and yet more precious to a young and
						elegant world, willing to abjure the ridicule of obsolete privileges, but
						not to lose their existing advantages.</p></quote><p>The manner of this new-fashioned, liberalized <ref target="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</ref>'s passion for poor Indiana may be easily imagined, even
					without the information given upon one occasion.</p><quote><p>He had two days good, which he thus allotted. The remainder of<pb n="276"/>the closing day to affect, the morrow to persuade, his intended victim,
						and the following day to his triumph.</p></quote><p>The reader is accordingly held in constant dread of seeing the impassioned and
					confiding Creole fall a victim to the seducer's arts and eloquence. She is
					saved, sometimes by fainting fits produced by extraordinary nervous sensibility,
					but generally, as well in reputation as in fact, by the intervention of her
					cousin, Sir Ralph Brown, who, first introduced as a caricature of all the faults
					and dulness ascribed by continental writers to Englishmen, proves in the end to
					be the very <hi rendition="#italics">prosopopeia</hi> of heroic self-immolating
					virtue. Passionately in love with Indiana, even from her infancy, he has
					uniformly sacrificed his feelings to his duties, and quietly suffers himself,
					after Indiana's ill-assorted marriage, to be considered a cold egoist, lest her
					sympathy for his real agonies should inflame his passion to such an
					ungovernable, unconcealable pitch, as, by arousing her husband's jealousy,
					should prevent his incessant care of her.</p><p>To return to Raymon and Indiana. We shall give the scene that really decides her
					fate, as, of its kind the most possible, from greater delicacy,—or must we say
					less indelicacy?—to translate. But some preliminary statements will be
					requisite. During an indispensable absence of Delmare, Indiana's husband, the
					vigilant guardianship of Sir Ralph foils and irritates Raymon's passion. The
					lover secretly gives Indiana a letter complaining of her apparent mistrust, and
					urging a thousand sophistical reasons why she should admit him at night to her
					chamber, where his respect will be inviolate and inviolable. She answers;</p><quote><p>"Who, <hi rendition="#italics">I</hi> fear thee, Raymon! Oh no! not now. I
						know too well how thou lovest me; my belief in thy love is too intoxicating.
						Come then. Neither do I fear myself; did I love thee less, I might, perhaps,
						be less calm, but I love thee as thou thyself dreamest not. Go away early to
						prevent Ralph's distrust. Return at midnight; you know the park and the
						house: here is the key of the postern gate; fasten it after you."</p></quote><p>Such perfect confidence almost subdues the libertine, but further proofs of Sir
					Ralph's suspicions dissipate his good intentions, and he arrives, determined not
					to lose the opportunity. Meanwhile Sir Ralph, after Raymon's departure, seeks to
					warn Indiana, without mortifying her by showing his knowledge of her imprudence.
					For this purpose he reveals to her his conviction, that Raymon, prior to his
					acquaintance with herself, had seduced her foster-sister and attendant, Noun,
					and afterwards, by his desertion, driven the wretched girl to suicide. Indiana,
					who had once surprised Raymon with Noun in her own chamber, but supposed he came
					for herself and had bribed Noun to admit him, now re-<pb n="277"/>solves to
					ascertain the truth. She receives her lover more gravely than usual.</p><quote><p>Raymon, surprised at this reception, ascribed it to some chaste scruple, some
						delicate reserve of youthful womanhood. He fell at her feet, saying,</p><p>"My best beloved, can you then fear me?"</p><p>But he immediately observed that Madame Delmare held something in her hand,
						which she seemed, with a playful affectation of gravity, to spread out
						before him. He stooped, and saw a mass of black hair, of unequal lengths,
						cut off hastily as it seemed, and which Indiana was smoothing in her
						hands.</p><p>"Do you recognize this?" she asked, fixing upon him her translucent eyes,
						that emitted a penetrating greenish brightness. </p><p>Raymon hesitated; he looked at the handkerchief that dressed her head, and
						thought he understood.</p><p>"Naughty child!" said he, taking the tresses from her. "Why cut them off?
						They were so beautiful, and I so loved them."</p><p>"You asked me yesterday," said she with a strange smile, "if I would
						sacrifice them to you."</p><p>"Oh, Indiana!" exclaimed Raymon, "well thou knowest that henceforward thou
						must to me be still more beautiful. Give, give; I will not regret the
						absence from thy forehead of those tresses I daily admired, but which I may
						now daily kiss and caress unquestioned—give them to me that they may never
						quit me more."</p><p>But as he took them, as he collected in his hand that profusion of locks,
						some of which hung down to the floor, Raymon felt in them a something harsh
						and dry, which he had never observed in the glossy bands upon Indiana's
						brow. He experienced a nervous shiver as he felt them cold and heavy, as
						though long cut, as he perceived that they had lost their perfumed moisture,
						their vital warmth. . . . .</p><p>"This is not <hi rendition="#italics">your</hi> hair," said he, as he untied
						the silk handkerchief that concealed Madame Delmare's tresses.</p><p>They were uninjured, and fell in all their luxuriance about her shoulders.
						But she, with a gesture of repulse, and still showing him the cut hair,
						said,</p><p>"Know you not these locks? Have you never admired, never caressed them? Has
						one wet night" (Noun had drowned herself, and his way this night had led him
						past the spot where her body was found) "robbed them of all their perfume?
						Have you not one recollection, one tear, for her who wore this ring?"</p><p>Raymon sank upon a chair, and Noun's hair dropped from his hand. So many
						painful emotions overpowered him. He was a bilious man, whose blood
						circulated rapidly, whose nerves were singularly excitable. He shivered from
						head to foot, and fell in a swoon upon the floor.</p><p>When he recovered, Madame Delmare was on her knees by his side, bathing him
						in her tears, and imploring his forgiveness. But Raymon no longer loved
						her.</p><p>"You have wounded me dreadfully," said he; "wounded me to a degree that you
						cannot heal. You can never restore my confidence in<lb/><fw type="vol"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. xiv. no. xxviii.</hi></fw><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">u</hi></fw><pb n="278"/>your heart; you have shown me how full of revenge and cruelty
						it is. Poor Noun! Unfortunate girl! It was against her I sinned, not against
						you! . . . And it is you who upbraid me with her death!—you, whom I have
						loved so passionately as to forget her, as to brave these agonies of
						remorse!—you, who on the faith of a kiss, have made me cross that river,
						that bridge, alone, with terror by my side, pursued by the infernal illusion
						of my crime! And when you discover how deliriously I love you, you strike
						your woman's nails into my heart, to seek there a little remnant of blood
						that may stream for you." . . . .</p><p>Madame Delmare made no reply. Motionless, pale, her hair dishevelled, her
						lips violet, her eyes glazed, she awakened Raymon's pity. Taking her hand,
						he said,</p><p>"And yet, so blind is my love for thee that I can still forget—against my
						will I feel I can—the past and the present, both the crime that blights my
						life, and the atrocity thou has just perpetrated. Love me, and I forgive
						thee."</p><p>Do you understand? Raymon offered Indiana his compassion, and she was happy
						to accept it! . . . .</p><p>Madame Delmare's despair rekindled desire together with pride in her lover's
						heart. When he saw her so fearful of losing his love, so humble before him,
						so resigned to receive his laws for the future, and his justification of the
						past, he recollected the purpose for which he had deceived Sir Ralph's
						watchfulness; he felt the advantage of his position. . . . . He waited till
						Indiana's heart was broken by her own sobs—till she had anticipated the
						horrors of desertion—till her distracting terrors had exhausted her
						strength. Then, when he saw her exhausted, expiring at his feet, awaiting
						her death in a word, he violently caught her in his arms and clasped her to
						his breast. She yielded like an infant; she gave up her lips to him
						unresistingly; she was almost dead.</p><p>But suddenly starting, as from a dream, she broke from his burning caresses,
						fled to the end of the room occupied by the picture of Sir Ralph, and as if
						placing herself under the protection of that grave personage, with his pure
						brow, his calm lips, she pressed herself against the portrait, palpitating,
						bewildered, full of strange terrors. Raymon thought she was afraid of
						herself and was his.</p><p>Authoritatively he snatched her from her asylum, and told her that he had
						come determined to keep his promises, but that her cruelty had released him
						from his oaths.</p></quote><p>The struggle, which we beg to be excused translating, continues, and at length
					Indiana seems about to be subdued by the common-place reproach, at which Raymon
					almost sneers whilst uttering it, of want of love. But now</p><quote><p>A short dry knock at her door stopped the blood in her arteries. Raymon and
						she remained motionless, not daring to breathe.</p><p>Then a paper was slid under the door—it was a leaf of a pocket-book, upon
						which these words were almost illegibly pencilled.</p><p>"Your husband is here. R<hi rendition="#smcaps">alph</hi>."</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *                *                *</p><pb n="279"/><p>"Well then," said Raymon, enthusiastically catching her in his arms, "since
						death environs us, be mine!" Be thy last word one of love; my last breath
						happiness!"</p><p>"This moment of terror and of courage," she replied, "might have been the
						happiest of my life; but you have spoiled it."</p><p>Wheels were heard in the farm yard; the castle bell was pulled by a rude and
						impatient hand.</p><p>"I know that ring," said Indiana, coldly attentive; "Ralph never spoke false.
						But you have time to fly. Go."</p></quote><p>Raymon now perforce obeys, and scarcely has he passed the postern by which he had
					entered, when</p><quote><p>Sir Ralph presented himself, and accosting him as coldly as if they had met
						at a rout, said,</p><p>"Be pleased to give me that key; should it be sought, there is no harm in its
						being found in my hands."</p><p>Raymon would have preferred the most deadly insult to this ironical
						generosity. He said,</p><p>"I am not the man to forget a real service, but I am the man to avenge an
						affront, to punish treachery."</p><p>Sir Ralph, without any change of tone or countenance, rejoined—"I desire not
						your gratitude, and shall quietly await your revenge. But this is not the
						moment for conversation; there is your road; think of Madame Delmare." And
						he disappeared.</p></quote><p>Indiana now writes a letter to Raymon, ending thus:—</p><quote><p>Not to be more beloved than Noun! Oh if I thought it! Yet she was more
						beautiful, far more beautiful, than me! Why then prefer me? You must needs
						have loved me otherwise, and better. This is what I wanted to say. Will you
						renounce the wish of being my lover in the way you were hers? If you will, I
						can still esteem you, can believe in your remorse, your sincerity, your
						love. If not, think no more of me; you will never see me again. I may die of
						it, but I had rather die than stoop to be merely your
						mistress.                                     I.</p></quote><p>This pride offends Raymon, and he resolves to humble it by making her his
					mistress. He accordingly, professing submission, pursues her with all the arts
					of the most consummate seducer; and she at length agrees to elope from her
					husband, when he, Delmare, shall embark for the Isle of Bourbon. The moment
					arrives.</p><quote><p>One morning, on coming home from a ball, Raymon found Madame Delmare in his
						chamber. She had come at midnight; during five long hours she had been
						waiting his return. . . . .</p><p>"I was waiting for you," said she, mildly. "During the days that you have not
						come to me, things have occurred that you must know, and I left my home last
						night to impart them to you."</p><p>"Incredible imprudence!" exclaimed Raymon, carefully shutting the door. "And
						my servants, who know that you are here! for they told me so."</p><lb/><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">u 2</hi></fw><pb n="280"/><p>"I did not conceal myself," said she coolly; "and as to the word you use, I
						think it ill chosen."</p><p>"I said imprudence, I should have said madness."</p><p>"I, for my part, should have said courage; but no matter; listen."</p></quote><p>She now tell him that M. Delmare sets out in three days for Bordeaux, there to
					embark for the Isle of Bourbon; and, what might not have been anticipated from
					the manner of the preceding dialogue, that she has eloped, and is to come live
					with him. Raymon is by no means delighted with the prospect.</p><quote><p>The crisis was urgent. . . . One more effort of imagination, thought Raymon
						to himself—one more love scene. And starting up with vivacity, he
						exclaimed—</p><p>"Never! Never will I accept such sacrifices! When I told thee I would,
						Indiana, it was boasting, or rather it was self-calumny; for a poltroon only
						would deliberately dishonour the woman he loves. Thou, in thy ignorance of
						life, hast not appreciated the importance of the step; and I, in my despair
						at the prospect of losing thee, would not reflect."</p><p>"Reflection has speedily returned to you!" said she, withdrawing her hand,
						which he sought to take.</p><p>"Indiana," he resumed, "see you not that you impose dishonour upon me,
						reserving the heroism for yourself, and that you condemn me because I would
						remain worthy of your love? Couldst thou still love me, say, simple and
						ignorant woman, were I to sacrifice thy life to my pleasure, thy reputation
						to my interests?"</p><p>"You contradict yourself," rejoined Indiana. "If by remaining with you I make
						you happy, what should you fear from opinion? Do you care more for it than
						for me?"</p><p>"Not on my own account do I care for it, Indiana!"</p><p>"On mine then? I foresaw your scruples, and to free you from all remorse, I
						have taken the active part. I did not wait for you to snatch me from my
						home; I did not even consult you previously to quitting it for ever. That
						decisive step is taken, and your conscience cannot reproach you with it. At
						this moment, Raymon, I am dishonoured. In your absence I counted upon that
						clock the hours that consummated my disgrace, and now, although the dawning
						day finds my brow as pure as it was yesterday, in public opinion I am a lost
						woman."</p><p rendition="#center">*                *                *                *                *</p><p>A sudden thought shot through Raymon's brain. The moment was come to conquer
						this woman's pride, or it never would come. She had just offered him every
						sacrifice that he did not desire, and there she stood before him, in haughty
						confidence that she ran no dangers beyond those she had foreseen. Raymon saw
						the mode of freeing himself from her importunate devotion, or of profiting
						by it. He was too much Delmare's friend to rob him of his wife; he ought to
						content himself with seducing her.</p><p>"Thou art right, my Indiana!" he exclaimed with fervour. "Thou recall'st me
						to myself, thou awakenest my transports, which the idea of thy perils, the
						fear of injuring thee, had frozen. . . . . . Let him come<pb n="281"/>then
						to tear thee from my raptures—the stupid husband who locks thee up, and goes
						to sleep upon his gross violence. Henceforward thou art no longer his; thou
						art my beloved, my companion, my mistress!"</p><p>Whilst so speaking, Raymon gradually heated himself, as was his wont, in
						pleading his passions. The situation was striking, was romantic; it offered
						dangers that seasoned it with all the effect of a fashionable drama. . . .
						He acted passion so as to deceive himself, and, shame to the silly woman!
						she gave herself up in delight to these illusive demonstrations—she felt
						happy, radiant with joy and hope—she forgave everything—she was almost on
						the point of granting everything.</p><p>But Raymon lost himself by his precipitation. . . . The clock struck seven.
						It is time to make an end, thought he; I must get her quietly home before
						Delmare comes here. He became more urgent and less tender. . . . . Indiana
						was recalled to herself; she repulsed the attacks of cold egotistical
						vice.</p></quote><p>Raymon now gets into a pet, and drinks a large glass of water.</p><quote><p>It calmed his delirium and cooled his love. He looked ironically at Indiana,
						and said—"Come, Madam, it is time to go home."</p><p>A ray of light dawned upon Indiana, and revealed to her Raymon's soul.</p></quote><p>Indiana now falls into a state of stupefaction that alarms Raymon, who seeks his
					mother's assistance. The old lady soothes the wretched young woman, and recals
					her to herself. But Indiana insists upon going home alone, and on foot.</p><quote><p>In vain Madame de Ramière trembled to see her, thus weakened and disordered,
						undertake so long a walk.</p><p>"I have strength enough," she replied. "A word of Raymon's has given it
						me."</p></quote><p>As was to be expected, she loses her way, and, absorbed in melancholy reverie,
					wanders along the banks of the Seine, beyond the limits of Paris.</p><quote><p>Insensibly she found herself on the brink of the water, which drove masses of
						ice to her feet, breaking them with a dry, cold sound against the stones
						that protected the banks. The greenish, murmuring water exercised an
						attractive force over Indiana's senses. One accustoms oneself to dreadful
						ideas; once fairly admitted, one comes to take pleasure in them. The example
						of Noun's suicide had so long solaced Indiana's hours of despair, that
						suicide had gradually become to her mind voluptuously alluring. A single
						idea, that of religion, had withheld her from yielding to it. But at this
						moment no consistent thought swayed her exhausted brain. She scarcely knew
						that there was a God, scarcely recollected that Raymon existed, and walked
						on, nearer and nearer to the river, obedient to the instinct of misfortune,
						to the magnetism of suffering.</p><p>When she felt the piercing cold of the water that now bathed her feet, she
						awoke as from somnambulism, and looking around, saw Paris far behind her,
						the Seine flying from beneath her feet, hurrying along<pb n="282"/>the white
						reflection of the houses, the greyish blue of the sky. This continuous
						movement of the water, and the immobility of the ground, became confused in
						her disordered perceptions, and she thought that the water slept, that the
						earth fled. At this moment of vertigo she leant against a wall, and stooped,
						as fascinated, towards what seemed a solid mass. . . . . . But the barking
						of a dog that frolicked around her distracted her attention, delaying for an
						instant the accomplishment of her purpose. And now a man, who, guided by the
						dog's voice, was hurrying forward, seized her by the waist, dragged her
						away, and laid her down upon the fragments of a deserted boat. She looked
						him in the face, but knew him not. He knelt beside her, wrapped her in his
						cloak, took her hands in his own to warm them, and called upon her name. But
						her brain was too feeble to make an effort; for eight-and-forty hours she
						had forgotten to eat.</p><p>When some degree of warmth circulated through her benumbed limbs, she saw
						Ralph on his knees before her, holding her hands, watching her eyes for a
						gleam of sense.</p><p>"Did you meet Noun?" she asked; and bewildered by a degree of <hi rendition="#italics">monomania</hi>, added, "I saw her go this way,"
						pointing to the river, "and wanted to follow her; but she went too fast, and
						I had not power to walk! 'Twas like a night-mare!"</p></quote><p>Even after this bitter lesson, an artfully pathetic letter, written by Raymon
					when, after his mother's death, a fit of sickness made him feel the want of a
					fond woman's cares, induces Indiana to fly from her husband and her cousin,
					secretly quit the Isle of Bourbon, and recross the Atlantic, to give herself up
					to him. Luckily, in the interval, he had recovered, forgotten his letter, and
					married a high-spirited heiress, who drives Indiana out of her house within a
					very few and safe minutes from her entering it. Again Sir Ralph, who had
					immediately followed her back to France, is her guardian angel; but he fails in
					all his endeavours to recover her from the torpor of despair into which she has
					now sunk. At length, considering her case as hopeless, he proposes to her that
					they should return to the Isle of Bourbon, (Delmare was dead,) and there commit
					suicide together. To this sociable <hi rendition="#italics">felo-de-se</hi><note>"Felon of him- or herself," a legal term describing someone who commits
						suicide or an illegal act that results in their own death.</note> scheme she
					gladly assents, and again they traverse the Atlantic. But before leaping arm in
					arm from the brow of a rock into the foaming cataract, which they have selected
					as the scene of their self-slaughter, Sir Ralph wishes that his heart should at
					last be better known to Indiana, and tells her the whole story of his love, his
					sufferings, his self-immolation, if not to her happiness, yet to the mitigation
					of the evils that oppressed her. The result may be anticipated. They do not kill

					to <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title>, not much so. Its object, (begging the <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref>'s pardon,) we cannot help
					believing to be an attack upon the existing institutions of society, as well as
					the delineation of the follies and prejudices of the divers classes of society,
					including the vices of the higher grades; for the writer's own prepossessions
					are all manifestly democratic, and she paints her old <hi rendition="#italics">Marquise</hi>, Valentine's grandmother, such as we can fancy none but the
					female partners of the <ref target="people.html#OrleansPhilippe">Regent
						Orleans</ref>'s orgies, or the associates of <ref target="people.html#BecuJeanne">Madame du Barri</ref> in the <hi rendition="#italics">petits appartements</hi> of <ref target="people.html#LouisXVKingofFrance">Louis XV</ref>.—and to have been
					one even of these last would make her <hi rendition="#italics">very</hi>
					old,—for without disputing the immorality of the French nobility prior to the
					revolution, we must observe that the high polish of their manners sufficed to
					insure general external decorum. And yet, to our conservative eyes, even these
					sketches establish the necessity, or at least the advantage, of a clear and
					marked distinction of ranks.</p><p>Valentine de Raimbault herself is the gentlest, purest, calmest of high-born
					maidens; she is affianced to an elegant and courtly diplomatist, the Comte de
					Lansac, whom she really likes, and believes that she loves as warmly as her
					nature is capable of loving; and she seems altogether as happily secured as may
					be against the dangers that we have seen besetting the path of poor Indiana.
					Moreover, she has a warning example in an elder sister, Louise, who having,
					several years before the opening of the tale, fallen a victim to the arts of
					man, has been turned out of doors, with the living proof of her shame, whilst
					her noble seducer was shot by her father in a duel. Louise is now secreted in a
					farm house upon the Raimbault estate, the mistress of which had been her nurse;
					and the secret intercourse between the two fondly attached sisters involves
					Valentine in an intimacy with Benedict Lhery, the farmer's over-educated nephew,
					whence springs all the mischief, and indeed all the story. Benedict, who is
					spoiled for a farmer, without being fitted for a learned profession, or made
					quite a gentleman, is the betrothed bridegroom of his equally over-educated
					cousin Athénaïs; but regardless of her passionate attachment to him, his
					fastidiousness only sees and disdains in her the follies and affectations
					engendered by an unsuitable education, and some weeks before our introduction to
					the parties, he had fallen in love with Louise, and been coldly rejected by her,
					notwithstanding that she ardently returned his passion. Her motive is neither
					pride of rank, nor humility of repentance—of this last sentiment the <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">author</ref> seems to have no idea—but
					respect for his engagement to Athénaïs, and for the wishes of her own kind
					hosts, the Lherys.</p><pb n="284"/><p>We will give the first meeting of Valentine and Benedict, as a specimen of <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame Dudevant</ref>'s powers, in a
					different style from the disagreeable and difficult scenes that we had to
					translate, as best we could, in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title>. It is May-day, and the village festival assembles the neighbourhood of
					all ranks upon the green. Old Lhery takes the arm of his nephew, who is newly
					returned from college, to present him to his landlady, the Dowager Comtesse de
					Raimbault, a rich plebeian, whose wealth has bought back the Raimbault estates
					and castle, (confiscated during the revolution,) which she has now visited to
					celebrate her daughter's marriage in feudal style.</p><quote><p>Valentine was seated upon the turf between her mother, the Comtesse de
						Raimbault, and her grandmother, the Marquise de Raimbault. Benedict knew
						none of these three ladies, but he had heard so much of them at the farm,
						that he was prepared for the icy, disdainful notice of the one, and the
						familiar, chatty reception of the other of the elder ladies. It seemed as if
						the old <hi rendition="#italics">Marquise</hi> sought by her talkative
						fussiness to compensate her daughter-in-law's contemptuous silence. But even
						this affectation of popularity was stamped with the habitual tone of feudal
						protection.</p><p>"What, is that Benedict?" she exclaimed. "Is that the poppet that I have seen
						at his mother's breast? Good morrow, my lad. I am delighted to see thee so
						tall, and so well dressed. Thou art so like thy mother that it is awful.
						Well, but dost' know that we are old acquaintance? Thou art the godson of my
						poor son, the General, who fell at Waterloo. 'Twas I gave thee thy first
						frock, but thou dostn't remember much of that. How long is't ago? Thou must
						be eighteen."</p><p>"I am two and twenty, Madam," returned Benedict.</p><p>"The deuce you are!" exclaimed the <hi rendition="#italics">Marquise</hi>,
						"How time flies! I thought thee about the age of my granddaughter. . . . .
						Valentine, speak to Benedict, 'tis the nephew of our good Lhery, the
						intended of thy little playfellow Athénaïs—Speak to him, child."</p></quote><p>The democratically haughty Benedict is exasperated by this pompous
					affability.</p><quote><p>He had fixed a bold and mocking gaze upon Valentine. . . . But the expression
						of that beautiful face was so sweet and serene, the sound of that voice so
						pure and so soothing, that the young man dropped his eyes and blushed like a
						girl.</p><p>"Ah Sir," said she, "what I can say to you most sincerely, is, that I love
						Athénaïs like a sister. Pray bring her to me, I have been long seeking
						without finding her, and would fain embrace her."</p><p>Benedict bowed profoundly, and soon returned with his cousin. Athénaïs now
						walked about the <hi rendition="#italics">fête</hi>, arm in arm with the
						noble daughter of the Counts of Raimbault; and although she affected to take
						this as a matter of course, as Valentine really did, she could not disguise
						the triumph of her proud joy, as she met the women who envied, and strove to
						run her down.</p><pb n="285"/><p>The fiddle now gave the signal for the <hi rendition="#italics">Bourrée</hi>
						(a provincial dance), Athénaïs was engaged to dance it with one of the
						youths who had waylaid her, and she requested Mademoiselle de Raimbault to
						be her <hi rendition="#italics">vis-a-vis</hi><note>"Face to face"; in this case, her counterpart taking the opposing
							position in a dance formation.</note>.</p><p>"I must wait till I am asked," Valentine answered with a smile.</p><p>"Well then, Benedict," exclaimed Athénaïs eagerly, "go and ask
						Mademoiselle."</p><p>The intimidated Benedict consulted Valentine's eyes. In their soft and candid
						expression he read the wish to accept his offer, and took a step towards
						her. But the <hi rendition="#italics">Comtesse</hi> suddenly touched her
						arm, saying loud enough to be heard by Benedict;</p><p>"My child, I forbid your dancing <hi rendition="#italics">la bourrée</hi>
						with any one but M. de Lansac."</p><p>Benedict now first observed a very handsome young man, upon whose arm the <hi rendition="#italics">Comtesse</hi> leant; and he recollected the name of
						Mademoiselle de Raimbault's intended. He understood the mother's motive. At
						a certain <hi rendition="#italics">trill</hi> of the fiddle, executed before
						beginning <hi rendition="#italics">la bourrée</hi>, every gentleman, by
						immemorial custom, salutes his partner. The Comte de Lansac, too well bred
						to allow himself such a liberty in public, compromised matters with the laws
						of Berry, by respectfully kissing Valentine's hand.</p><p>He then tried a few steps, but finding it impossible to catch the measure of
						this dance, which no stranger ever could dance well, he stopped and said to
						Valentine—</p><p>"I have now done my part, and at your mother's command installed you here;
						but my awkwardness must not spoil your pleasure. You had a partner waiting
						you; allow me to resign my claim to him." And turning to Benedict, he added,
						in a tone of exquisite politeness, "Will you, sir, kindly be my substitute?
						You will acquit yourself far better than me." . . . .</p><p>The Countess was satisfied with the diplomatic manner in which her intended
						son-in-law had arranged the affair. But suddenly the fiddler, facetious and
						waggish as are all genuine artists, interrupted the air of the dance, and
						with a malicious affectation, repeated the imperative <hi rendition="#italics">trill</hi>. The new dancer is bound to salute his
						partner. Benedict turns pale, and is out of countenance, Daddy Lhery,
						frightened at the anger that he sees in the eyes of the Countess, springs to
						the musician and implores him to go on with the dance. The village <ref target="people.html#Orpheus">Orpheus</ref> will listen to nothing;
						triumphant amidst peals of laughter and of <hi rendition="#italics">bravos</hi>, he persists in not resuming the air until the
						indispensable form is gone through. The other dancers grow impatient. Madame
						de Raimbault is about to take away her daughter. But M. de Lansac, a
						courtier and a man of sense, feeling the ridicule of the scene, again
						addresses Benedict:</p><p>"Come, sir, must I again authorize you to enforce a right, of which I dared

					two noble sisters; and, notwithstanding the fair promise of the blush unalloyed
					by a laugh, he and Valentine presently fall head over ears in love with each
					other. Both are, however, conscious of the insuperable obstacles that sever
					them; and although Benedict refuses to fulfil his engagement with Athénaïs,
					Valentine so far fulfils hers with M. de Lansac, as to go through the marriage
					ceremony: but she excludes him from the bridal chamber upon a plea of illness,
					and puts herself to sleep with a good dose of opium. Meanwhile, Benedict, a pair
					of loaded pistols in his pocket, has concealed himself in this same bridal
					chamber, with the benevolent intention of preserving unsullied the virgin purity
					of his beloved, by blowing out either the bridegroom's brains or hers, and then
					his own. Of the nocturnal scene that ensues suffice it to say, that the lover,
					in point of fact, respects the purity he had come to guard; but despairing of
					being able to guard it much longer, upon going away before daylight he executes
					so much of his original purpose as to blow out his own brains. He does the job
					imperfectly, however, and recovers. But Valentine is made really ill by the
					shock of the first report; and ill M. de Lansac leaves her, thus avoiding the
					inconvenience of taking a wife with him upon his diplomatic mission to
					Petersburg.</p><p>Fifteen months of platonic love follow, guarded by the vigilance of poor Louise,
					who, though distracted with jealousy, carefully watches over her darling sister.
					At the end of this time M. de Lansac returns unexpectedly from Russia; but it is
					the importunity of creditors, not love for the wife whose fortune is to satisfy
					them, that brings him back. Without offering to penetrate into her maiden bower,
					he desires Valentine to sign papers that enable him to sell her estates, shows
					her that he is aware of her connexion with Benedict and believes it to be
					criminal, repulses her attempts at confession, refuses her request to save her
					from danger by taking her away with him, and departs. And now the virtue of the
					lovers is at length exhausted. <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame

					visits, to discuss and arrange their future plans, M. de Lansac having,

					strongly suspect that few readers who chanced to begin their acquaintance with
					the set by its perusal, would think of opening another of them[<hi rendition="#italics">sic</hi>] To give such an analysis of <title><hi rendition="#italics">Lelia</hi></title> as we have given of <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title> is impossible, since much of the detail of the story is such as respect
					for our readers and ourselves must prevent our even alluding to. Like <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title>, it is an attack upon the existing laws of society, and to say the
					truth, though for the reasons above intimated we cannot explain, its satire
					seems to be directed nearly as much against those of nature. But we will
					endeavour, by a few brief words concerning the story and its characters, to give
					the reader some idea of the nature of this most extraordinary production of a
					woman, not belonging to the <ref target="people.html#WilsonHarriette">Harriette
						Wilson</ref> class, and to show that its popularity in France, and all this
					lady's writings are, we are assured, highly popular, is no wise owing to the

					prevents the catastrophe by suicide. The female character presented to us as the
					most amiable in disposition, the most consistent and rational in conduct, is the

					who, after running a career of wild libertinism and yet wilder gambling, has
					committed forgery, been convicted, branded,<pb n="288"/>and sent to the galleys,
					where he has duly served his time, and learned philosophy and morality. We must
					add, though the remark be far inferior in importance to the preceding, that the
					poet, the ex-galley slave, and Lelia herself, are all so mystically metaphysical
					in their conversations and reasonings, as actually to bewilder a plain English

					patients, and even suffering her tongue to echo the oaths, slang, and almost the
					more offensive expressions, to which her attendance upon such patients has
					inured her ear.</p><p>The story is this. Rose is a young strolling actress, born, almost upon the
					stage, of the most profligate of affectionate mothers, and brought up behind the
					scenes. From innate purity she resists her mother's exhortations and commands to
					eke out the scanty earnings of her honest art by the ampler gains of that
					infamous traffic, which, in France at least, is too often combined with the
					profession of a public performer. At length her mother's reproaches and filial
					duty wring from her a loathing obedience, when the depth and dignity of her
					despair constrain the young profligate to whom she is sold to respect her
					innocence. This is a bold, we think a fine conception, and from the pen of a
					Scott, we can fancy such an incident as beautiful and sublime as it is
					overpowering. But we regret to say, that in the hands of the present writer,
					this scene, so difficult to manage, is not as well executed as conceived, nor
					yet touched with the nice delicacy requisite to allow of our extracting it. The
					conquered libertine places Rose first with his devotee sister, then in a convent
					for education, and she resolves to love her deliverer hopelessly and eternally.
					Her former profession being discovered, she is expelled the convent, returns to
					the stage, and acquires a high character alike for virtue and for talent. Here
					she captivates her original protector, Horace Cazalés, and they are upon the
					point of marriage; but the Cazalés family successfully labour to pre-<pb n="290"/>vent so disreputable an alliance, and succeed in estranging him from the
					actress.</p><p>Meanwhile, Blanche is a novice in the Parisian convent, where Rose was a boarder,
					and a romantic friendship has sprung up between the two young girls. Blanche
					falls in love with the drawing-master, another libertine, who returns her
					passion, but not ardently enough to think of incumbering himself with a
					portionless wife. Chance throws in her way, amongst his drawings, a paper,
					written by his bosom friend Horace Cazalés, confessing his having, two or three
					years since, taken a shameless advantage of the imbecility of a poor idiot girl,
					Denise Lazare, bequeathed to his care by her dying father, to whom he, Horace,
					owed the preservation of his life, and stating that he had subsequently placed
					her in a convent at Bordeaux. This paper strangely disorders Blanche, whose
					recollections of anything prior to a recent violent nervous illness are quite
					indistinct. She shows the paper to her confessor, and reveals her confused
					recollections and fears; but he argues against them as nervous delusions, and
					the preparations for her taking the veil proceed. We will extract the scene of
					her profession, as again in a different style from those we have already
					given.</p><quote><p>Upon this day the church, its inlaid floor waxed like that of a <hi rendition="#italics">salon</hi>, and resplendent as a mirror, was
						dressed out with flowers, as for the gayest of festivals. The walls were
						tapestried with garlands, the pavement of the choir was strewed with
						rose-leaves, the vaulted roof impregnated with incense. The great silver
						chandeliers, the golden angels of the tabernacle and of the cross, the <hi rendition="#italics">rosettes</hi> of the gothic frame-work, glittered
						with light and sunshine; and the metal flowers heaped upon the shrines,
						rendered the altar radiant with the splendour reflected from their brilliant
						surfaces. The organ poured out floods of its own full and vibratory harmony;
						the bell rebounded with joyous cadences in its Italian belfry; the metallic
						and penetrating voices of young maidens floated dyingly away, from arcade to
						arcade, amidst the clouds of incense and of melody. Whilst gazing upon the
						chapel thus dazzling, whilst breathing such perfumes, whilst inhaling the
						inebriating mystic humidity that seized the soul at the foot of the columns,
						whilst plunging in the extacy which thrilled every fibre, deluged every
						recess of that soul, it might have been difficult to guess that a poor girl
						in the vigour of her age, in the first bloom of her beauty, was about to be
						affianced to eternal seclusion. . . .</p><p>The clergy invited to the ceremony adorned the choir with the luxury of their
						wealth, with the splendour of their glory. . . . . The galleries were
						thronged with the numerous friends of the community, as an author fills the
						pit of the theatre with friends to applaud his piece; the back of the chapel
						was occupied by the nuns in long black mantles; the pupils and boarders
						filled the middle portion, separated by gratings from the other two; and the
						crowd that had been unable to make way into the<pb n="291"/>galleries,
						pressed into that part of the church whence profane eyes could not pierce
						the veil that divided them from the nuns.</p><p>But at a given signal, after the customary chaunts and a short address from
						the confessor, the Abbé P——, the black curtain glided back upon its rods,
						and the whole chapter of the Augustine nuns was seen, ranged in a semicircle
						of stalls. Alone, kneeling before a praying desk, the novice, richly
						attired, enveloped in a white Indian shawl and a silver lama veil, awaited
						her <hi rendition="#italics">parents</hi>, represented, according to custom,
						by two kindly disposed individuals. The Abbé Causcalmon, with his dignified
						demeanor and venerable countenance, was invariably commissioned to play the
						father. He arose gravely, went forward, and offered his hand to a tall <hi rendition="#italics">Soeur de Charité</hi>, (sister Olympie, who had
						brought Blanche from a Bordeaux convent to this,) who knelt amongst the
						spectators, and together crossing the nave of the church, they approached
						the novice. The worthy <hi rendition="#italics">Abbé</hi>, accustomed to
						such solemnities, moved with due deliberation. Not so sister Olympie, whose
						presence Blanche had solicited, and who, impatient of an idle ceremony,
						dragged the <hi rendition="#italics">Abbé</hi> by the arm, and, to his great
						discomposure hurried him forwards. . . . . . But despite her air of hurry,
						sister Olympie was in tears. She loved not the cloistered life, could not
						comprehend its use, and pitied those who were dedicated to it. . . .</p><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">father</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">mother</hi>, each taking a hand of the novice, again crossed the nave,
						and led her to the high altar, where Monseigneur the archbishop of V——
						awaited her, seated in a magnificent arm chair, and turning his back upon
						the <hi rendition="#italics">Holy of Holies</hi>, before which knelt the
						multitude.</p><p>Attired as for a bridal day, radiant in diamonds, satin, lace, and flowers,
						the novice, trembling like a leaf beaten by the winds, advanced with
						difficulty to a cushion placed at <hi rendition="#italics">Monseigneur's</hi> feet. The rich dress, taken from the convent
						treasury only for such occasions, heightened the elegance of her lofty
						stature, now timidly bent, and the dazzling whiteness of her bare arms and
						shoulders. Her heart throbbed under the belt of pearls, and when sister
						Olympie awkwardly threw back the veil which had concealed that lovely face
						from all eyes, she seemed a beautiful alabaster virgin from the chisel of
							<ref target="people.html#CanovaAntonio">Canova</ref>. A murmur of
						admiration, regret, and pity, arose from the throng that pressed forward to
						look upon her.</p><p>"My dear daughter," said the archbishop, "what do you ask?"</p><p>The <hi rendition="#italics">father</hi> and <hi rendition="#italics">mother</hi> answered, "We present our beloved daughter to the minister
						of the Lord, that she, now the betrothed of Christ, may become his
						bride."</p><p>"It is well," returned the prelate, "let her approach, and may the Lord give
						ear to her prayers!"</p><p>The novice arose.</p><p>"You are affianced to the Lord, my dear daughter."</p><p>"Yes, father," answered sister Blanche, so softly and timidly, that scarce
						could the sound of her voice be heard.</p><p>"Since when?"</p><p>"More than three years."</p><pb n="292"/><p>"Have you reached the age at which you can dispose of yourself?"</p><p>"I am upwards of twenty-one years old.</p><p>"What is your name, my dear sister?"</p><p>"Sister Blanche."</p><p>"That is your conventual name; but your name amongst men?"</p><p>"Blanche.—I never knew" . . . . .</p><p>"Denise Lazare," said sister Olympie, in audible accents.</p><p>The effect of this name seemed magical upon several persons near the altar.
						The Abbé P——, who stood upon its steps, uttered an exclamation of surprise,
						and hastened towards the novice with a vivacity not belonging to his age.
						Sister Blanche shuddered as though a red-hot iron had touched her; and her
						pale face was crimsoned. She half arose, as if to protest against sister
						Olympie's sentence. But suddenly, casting her bewildered eyes around, she
						grasped the Abbé P——'s arm, and clinging to it with all her strength she
						stretched out her other hand towards a man, lividly pale, who had detached
						himself from the crowd, and stood before her, motionless, his hair on end,
						his lips blue. Then, collecting all the courage inspired by terror and
						distraction,</p><p>"'Tis he, 'tis he!" she exclaimed, seeking to hide herself under the folds of
						her confessor's white official robe, and fell senseless upon the richly
						flowered carpet of the altar.</p><p>The pale man, in whom the reader will have recognized Horace Cazalés, had
						stood petrified from the moment the novice's veil was removed. But when she
						recognized him, when she had blasted him with her dreadful gaze, he sprang
						towards her, and would have followed sister Olympie, who, in her robust
						arms, was carrying Blanche off toward the choir, had not the Abbé P——, with
						his air of blended mildness and severity, seized him by the coat.</p><p>"No scandal, sir," said he to Horace in an under tone. "I know every thing. I
						will have the honour of waiting upon you in the course of the day;
						withdraw."</p></quote><p rendition="#center"/><p>Horace Cazalés is now persuaded by his devout sister, that it is his duty,
					forgetting the actress Rose, to marry his former victim; as is Blanche by a
					young ascetic Jesuit confessor, substituted for the unmanageably rational
					Jesuit, Abbé P——, that it is her's to efface her unconscious pollution by the
					Church's sanction, and to save her polluter's soul by accepting his hand. She
					dies of agitation and suffering upon the evening of her wedding-day, and Rose
					again forsakes the theatre to take the veil in the convent—the superior who had
					expelled her being changed,—where she had known and loved Blanche.</p><p>The reader will have observed that there is much to dislike as well as to like in <title><hi rendition="#italics">Rose et Blanche</hi></title>.

						<ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">George Sand</ref>'s or <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame Dudevant</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics">beau ideal</hi> of wedded life.</p><p>This is the story of a young Frenchman (Count St. Julien,) of a noble but decayed
					family, austerely educated by a conscientious Catholic priest, who runs away
					from his father's dilapidated <hi rendition="#italics">ci-devant chateau</hi> in
					disgust upon learning that his mother had, in the days of her youth, been frail.
					On the road he falls in with a beautiful Italian princess, in a rather
					theatrical <hi rendition="#italics">costume</hi>, but the actual reigning
					sovereign of dominions, some few miles square, in Friuli; he pleases her fancy,
					and is engaged as her confidential secretary. Princess Quintilia Cavalcanti
					immediately becomes to her new secretary an object of admiration, curiosity,
					perplexity and suspicion. She is incomparably beautiful, intellectual, zealous
					in her sovereign duties, and learned, and almost equally giddy, coquettish and
					frivolous; whilst her frank good humour too often degenerates into a sort of
					hail-fellow-well-met manner, into masculine coarseness, for—<hi rendition="#italics">horresco referens</hi>,<note>"I shudder as I tell it,"
						an expression from <ref target="people.html#Virgil">Virgil</ref>'s <hi rendition="#italics"><title>Aeneid</title></hi>, Book II, line 204.</note> but the truth must be told—the beautiful
					princess smokes! St. Julien is immediately assailed with reports of her
					licentiousness and cruelty. A French traveller boasts of having had a <hi rendition="#italics">bal d'opera</hi><note>A large ball or dance, likely masked, and so often an occasion for illicit
						trysts under at least the pretence of anonymity.</note> intrigue with her at
					Paris. A story is current at her court of a certain Max, the illegitimate son of
					a German prince, and her first love, who had unaccountably disappeared after a
					public quarrel with her, and was believed to be buried in a certain pavilion,
					further notorious as the usual scene of her assignations. An equerry intimates
					that he has been a favoured lover, and owes his life, as a discarded one, solely
					to his extreme dis-<lb/><fw type="vol"><hi rendition="#smcaps">vol. xiv. no. xxviii.</hi></fw><fw type="sig"><hi rendition="#smcaps">x</hi></fw><pb n="294"/>cretion; and a page, whom the princess persists in treating as a
					child, and admitting to the familiarity of a child, incessantly rallies St.
					Julien upon his stupidity and dulness, in not uniting the post of favourite to
					that of confidential secretary. A thousand accidents confirm these degrading
					ideas of Quintilia, which are contradicted only by want of actual evidence, and
					by her apparent tranquil consciousness of self-approbation. The unhappy
					secretary meanwhile is madly in love with his princess, utterly at a loss
					whether to think her the first of created beings, or another <ref target="people.html#CatherineIIEmpressofRussia">Catherine II</ref>. of
					Russia, jealous of every body, and thoroughly miserable. At length he hazards a
					declaration of his passion, which is received with irony, and followed by a
					confession of his uncertainties about her character. Some days afterwards, the
					princess sends for him, desires him to turn his love into friendship, and, to
					prove her value for this last sentiment from him, gives him an explanation,
					which, however, explains nothing, except, perhaps, some of the writer's peculiar
					notions. The passage that seems to bear this interpretation is as follows:—</p><quote><p>Do not take me for a virtuous woman, Julien. I know not what virtue is; I
						believe in it as I do in Providence, without defining or comprehending it. I
						know not what it is to struggle against oneself; I never had occasion to do
						so; I never subjected myself to principles; I have never felt a want of
						them; I never was hurried further than I chose to go; I have fully indulged
						all my fancies, and never found myself in danger. A man who feels in his
						soul no shameful wound requiring concealment may drink to intoxication, and
						lay bare to view all the recesses of his conscience. A woman who does not
						love vice need not fear it; she may traverse its mire without a single stain
						upon her gown;<note>This seems rather easier for man in his doublet and
							hose, than for woman in her flowing robes.—Petticoats are apt to get
							sadly draggled in the mire. [<ref target="people.html#BuskMary">Busk</ref>'s note.]</note> she may touch the foulness of soul of
						others, as the sister of charity touches the leprosy in the hospital. She
						has the privilege of toleration and pardon: if she does not use it she must
						be wicked. To be chaste and wicked is to be cold, to be chaste and kind is
						to be good. I never thought this difficult for well governed minds.</p></quote><p>We will add an extract or two, exhibiting princess Quintilia as she appears to
					St. Julien and the reader. She has been for months shut up in her cabinet with
					her secretary, studying the philosophy of government, preparing codes of law,
					maturing projects for promoting the happiness of her subjects.</p><quote><p>Six months had passed thus. One evening the work was finished; the princess
						had been more serious and thoughtful than usual; she wrote with her own hand
						a last page in the register that Julien offered her. While she wrote,
						Ginetta, (a favourite waiting maid,) who had stolen softly into the room,
						waited anxiously, her quick eye glancing interrogatively, now at the door
						where Julien perceived the skirt of Galeotto (the page), now at the darkened
						and knitted brow of the prin-<pb n="295"/>cess. The princess laid down her
						pen absently, buried her head in her hands, took the pen up again, played a
						moment with a lock of her hair that had broken loose, started, wrote a few
						figures, signed the register, closed and pushed it away. Then rising, she
						turned to Ginetta, and stuck the pen amidst her black locks. The chambermaid
						uttered a cry of joy. "Have you done at last, madam?" she exclaimed. "Will
						that beautiful hand quit the pen to resume the scepter and the fan? . . .
						May I toss to the winds the ugly pen that you have placed in my hair, and
						that feels as heavy as lead?"</p><p>"Make an <hi rendition="#italics">auto-da-fé</hi><note>"Act of faith"; refers to the penance imposed by the Spanish and

					us to be brief in what we have to say of this new production of our prolific
						<ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref>. In powerful writing
					and vigorous portraiture, <title><hi rendition="#italics">Jacques</hi></title> bears more resemblance to <title><hi rendition="#italics">Indiana</hi></title> and <title><hi rendition="#italics">Valentine</hi></title>, than to its three immediate predecessors; and one reason of this may
					be, that the object of it is the same with those two remarkable productions.
					Decidedly, <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">Madame Dudevant</ref> is so much
					more at home in her delineations of matrimonial miseries, (of which in fact <title><hi rendition="#italics">Jacques</hi></title> is but a third picture,) than in any other field, that she would well
					deserve to be called the <hi rendition="#italics">Anti-matrimonial
					Novelist</hi>, if such a title implied any enviable distinction. Notwithstanding
					the repeated disclaimers which we have seen she has made of the imputed (fairly
					enough, we think) tendency of her works, she has in this new one put the
					following declaration into the mouth of the hero, which<pb n="297"/>must be
					received, we suppose, as a proof that her own sentiments on the subject remain
					unaltered.</p><quote><p>I have not changed my opinion, I have not become reconciled to society, and
						marriage I still look upon as one of its most odious institutions. I doubt
						not that it will be abolished, if mankind make any progress towards justice
						and reason; a more humane and not less sacred tie will replace it, and
						secure the existence of the children who shall be born to one man and one
						woman, without enchaining for ever the liberty of either. But men are too
						coarse (<hi rendition="#italics">grossiers</hi>) and women too cowardly (<hi rendition="#italics">lâches</hi>) to demand a law more noble than the
						law of iron which rules them; to beings without conscience and without
						virtue, heavy chains are necessary. In this age it is impossible to realise
						the ameliorations which a few generous spirits dream of; these spirits
						forget that they are a century in advance of their contemporaries, and that
						before the law can be changed, man himself must be changed.</p></quote><p>His actions, however, are not in unison with his professions; he marries—and is
					punished accordingly.</p><p>In the present instance, the <ref target="people.html#SandGeorge">authoress</ref>
					has illustrated the impossibility of constant love, and wedded happiness, by the
					fate of a union, the counterpart of which is certainly not of frequent
					occurrence in actual life. The husband, Jacques, is a man, who, having lived
					through the tempest of <ref target="people.html#Napoleon">Napoleon</ref>'s
					triumphs and fate, and had some score of impassioned intrigues in as many years,
					becomes, at the age of thirty-five, tired of active life and turns philosopher,
					and fancies it happiness to lie on the sofa and smoke hour after hour by the
					side of his wife; and the lady is a pretty, ignorant, romantic school-girl of
					seventeen, who has nothing upon earth with which to occupy her solitude except
					her love and admiration of her silent, smoking husband. Jacques himself is, we
					must confess, a personage the prototype of whom we never had the good luck to
					meet with, or hear of. Men there are still, we doubt not, even in these
					degenerate days, who can drink a whole company under the table, and walk
					steadily away. But that a boy of fifteen, the first time he pollutes his lips
					with tobacco or alcohol, should smoke and swill brandy, at the discretion of a
					whole regiment, without perceptible effect upon head, stomach, or nerves, is a
					physiological phenomenon as startling, as his laming, in a previously determined
					manner, a professed duellist, the very first time he wields a sabre. One who
					begins so is not to be judged by common rules; wherefore we have not a word to
					say upon the probability of his committing suicide, to enable his faithless wife
					to marry her paramour. The character of this personage, the fickle, impetuous,
					selfish Octave, is true to nature; as is, we fear, the passion he inspires in
					the tender heart of the sweet but silly heroine, Fernande. Many of the minor
					characters are admirable sketches. The rough veterans of the Imperial army are
					hit off with a spirited, a masculine hand.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
