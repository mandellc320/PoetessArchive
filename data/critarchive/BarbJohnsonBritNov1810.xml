                    melancholy and philosophical. The frame of the story is an elegant and happy
                    exertion of fancy. It was probably suggested to his mind from recollections of
                    the impression made upon his fancy by a book which he translated when he first
                    entered on his literary career, namely, <title>

            <p>In that country, it is said, the younger branches of the royal family, instead of
                    being sacrificed, as in some of the Eastern monarchies, to the jealousy of the
                    reigning sovereign, are secluded from the world in a romantic and beautiful
                    valley, where they are liberally provided with every thing that can gratify
                    their tastes or amuse their solitude. This recess, which <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref> calls <hi rendition="#italics">the happy valley</hi>, he has described with much
                    richness of imagination. It is represented as being shut in by inaccessible

                    iron, which were thrown <lb/>

                    time artists and teachers of every kind, capable of contributing to the
                    amusement or solace of the princes, were admitted; but once admitted, they were
                    immured for life with the royal captives. Every charm of nature and every
                    decoration of art is supposed to be collected in this charming spot, and that
                    its inhabitants had been, in general, content with the round of amusements
                    provided for them, till at length Rasselas, a young prince of a sprightly and
                    active genius, grows weary of an existence so monotonous, and is seized with a
                    strong desire of seeing the world at large. In pursuance of this project, he
                    contrives to dig a passage through the mountain, and to escape from this
                    paradise with his favourite sister Nekayah and her attendant, and the
                    philosopher who had assisted them in their enterprise, and who, being previously
                    acquainted with the world, is to assist their inexperience. They are all equally
                    disgusted with the languor of sated desires and the inactivity of unvaried
                    quiet, and agree to range the world in order to make their <hi rendition="#italics">choice of life</hi>.</p>
            <p>The author, having thus stretched his canvass, proceeds to exhibit and to
                    criticize the various situations and modes of human existence; public life and
                    private; marriage and celibacy; commerce, rustic employments, religious
                    retirement, &amp;c., and finds that in all there is something good and something
                    badâthat marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures; that the
                    hermit cannot secure himself from vice, but by retiring from the exercise of
                    virtue; that <pb n="iii"/>shepherds are boors, and philosophersâonly men.
                    Unable to decide amidst such various appearances of good and evil, and having
                    seen enough of the world to be disgusted with it, they end their search by
                    resolving to return with the first opportunity in order to end their days in the
                    happy valley; and this, to use the author's words in the title of his last
                    chapter, is "the conclusion, in which nothing is concluded."</p>
            <p>Such is the philosophic view which <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr.
                        Johnson</ref> and many others have taken of life; and such indecision would
                    probably be the consequence of thus narrowly sifting the advantages and
                    disadvantages of every station in this mixt state, if done without that feeling
                    reference to each man's particular position, and particular inclinations,
                    which is necessary to incline the balance. If we choose to imagine an insulated
                    being, detached from all connexions and all duties, it may be difficult for mere
                    reason to direct his choice; but no man is so insulated: we are woven into the
                    web of society, and to each individual it is seldom dubious what <hi rendition="#italics">he</hi> shall do. Very different is the search after
                    abstract good, and the pursuit of what a being born and nurtured amidst
                    innumerable ties of kindred and companionship, feeling his own wants, impelled
                    by his own passions, and influenced by his own peculiar associations, finds best
                    for <hi rendition="#italics">him</hi>. Except he is indolent or fastidious, he
                    will seldom hesitate upon his choice of life. The same position holds good with
                    regard to duty. We may bewilder ourselves in abstract questions of general good,
                    or puzzle our moral sense with imagi-<lb/>
               <fw type="sig">a2</fw>
               <pb n="iv"/>nary cases of conscience; but it is
                    generally obvious enough to every man what duty dictates to him, in each
                    particular case, as it comes before him.</p>
            <p>The proper moral to be drawn from <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Rasselas</hi>
               </title> is, therefore, not that goods and evils are so
                    balanced against each other that no unmixed happiness is to be found in
                    life,âa deduction equally trite and obvious; nor yet that a reasoning man
                    can make no choice,âbut rather that a <hi rendition="#italics">merely</hi>
                    reasoning man will be likely to make no choice,âand therefore that it
                    becomes every man to make early that choice to which his particular position,
                    his honest partialities, his individual propensities, his early associations
                    impel him. Often does it happen that, while the over-refined and speculative are
                    hesitating and doubting, the plain honest youth has secured happiness. Without
                    this conclusion, the moral effect of the piece, loaded as it is with the
                    miseries of life, and pointing out no path of action as more eligible than
                    another, would resemble that of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Candide</hi>
               </title>, where the party, after all their adventures, agree to
                    plant cabbages in their own garden: but the gloomy ideas of the English
                    philosopher are softened and guarded by sound principles of religion.</p>
            <p>Along with <ref target="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</ref>, he strongly paints
                    and perhaps exaggerates the miseries of life; but instead of evading their force
                    by laughing at them, or drawing from them a satire against Providence, which
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Candide</hi>
               </title> may be truly said
                    to be, our author turns the mind to the solid consolations of a future state:
                    "All," says he, "that<pb n="v"/> virtue can afford is quietness
                    of conscience, and a steady prospect of a future state: this may enable us to
                    endure calamity with patience, but remember that patience must suppose
                    pain."</p>
            <p>Such is the plan of this philosophical romance, in the progress of which the
                    author makes many just strictures on human life, and many acute remarks on the
                    springs of human passions; but they are the passions of the species, not of the
                    individual. It is life, as viewed at a distance by a speculative man, in a kind
                    of birdâs-eye view; not painted with the glow and colouring of an actor in the
                    busy scene: we are not led to say, "This man is painted naturally,"
                    but, "Such is the nature of man." The most striking of his pictures is
                    that of the philosopher, who imagined himself to have the command of the
                    weather, and who had fallen into that species of insanity by indulging in the
                    luxury of solitary musing, or what is familiarly called castle-building. His
                    state is strikingly and feelingly described, and no doubt with the peculiar
                    interest arising from what the author had felt and feared in his own mind; for
                    it is well known that at times he suffered under a morbid melancholy near akin
                    to derangement, which occasionally clouded his mighty powers; and no doubt he
                    had often indulged in these unprofitable abstractions of thought, these seducing
                    excursions of fancy.</p>
            <p>The following remark ought to startle those who have permitted their mind to feed
                    itself in solitude with its own creations and wishes. "All power of fancy
                    over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can<pb n="vi"/> control or repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as
                    any depravation of the mental faculties. In time, some particular train of ideas
                    fixes the attention, all other intellectual gratifications are rejected. By
                    degrees the reign of fancy is confirmed; she grows first imperious, and in time
                    despotic; then fictions begin to operate as realities, false opinions fasten
                    upon the mind, and life passes away in dreams of rapture or of
                    anguish."</p>

                    author's works, that in which his peculiar style best harmonizes with the

                    and other works, in which the costume is taken from nations whose remoteness
                    destroys the idea of colloquial familiarity. We silence our reason by the laws
                    we have imposed upon our fancy, and are content that both Nekayah and her female
                    attendant, at the sources of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, or the foot of the
                    Pyramid, should express themselves in language which would appear unnaturally
                    inflated in the mouths of a young lady and her waiting-maid conversing together
                    in <placeName>London</placeName> or in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. It has been
                    remarked, however, that Nekayah, it is difficult to say why, is more
                    philosophical than her brother.</p>
            <p>It has been already mentioned that the frame<pb n="vii"/> of this piece was
                    probably suggested by the authorâs having some years before translated an
                    account of <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName>. It may be remarked by the way, how
                    different an idea of the country and its inhabitants seems to have been
                    entertained at that time from that which is suggested by the accounts of <ref target="people.html#BruceJames">Bruce</ref> and <ref target="people.html#AnnesleyGeorge">Lord Valentia</ref>. <ref target="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</ref>, who probably took his ideas
                    from the voyage-writers of the time, represents the country of "jealous
                        <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName>" as a perfect paradise, "a world
                    within itself; disdaining all assault;" and mentions the "palaces, and
                    fanes, and villas, and gardens, and cultured fields" of this innocent and
                    amiable people with poetic rapture. We must suppose that <ref target="people.html#LoboJeronimo">Father Lobo</ref> never had the honour of

                    composed for the purpose of enabling the author to visit his mother in her last
                    illness, and for defraying the expenses of her funeral. It was written with
                    great rapidity; for the author himself has told us that it was composed in the
                    evenings of one week, sent to the press in portions as it was written, and never
                    reperused when finished. It was much read, and has been translated into several
                    languages. Rich indeed must be the stores of that mind which could pour out its
                    treasures with such rapidity, and clothe its thoughts, almost spontaneously, in
                    language so correct and ornamented.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the genius of <ref target="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</ref>
                    has been in some measure mistaken. The ponderosity of his manner has led the
                    world to give him more credit for science, and less for fancy, than<pb n="viii"/> the character of his works will justify. His remarks on life and manners are
                    just and weighty, and show a philosophical mind, but not an original turn of
                    thinking. The novelty is in the style; but originality of style belongs to that
                    dress and colouring of our thoughts in which imagination is chiefly
                    concerned.</p>
            <p>In fact, imagination had great influence over him. His ideas of religion were
                    awful and grand, and he had those feelings of devotion which seldom subsist in a
                    strong degree in a cold and phlegmatic mind; but his religion was tinctured with
                    superstition, his philosophy was clouded with partialities and prejudices, his
                    mind was inclined to melancholy.</p>
            <p>In the work before us he has given testimony to his belief in apparitions, and
                    has shown a leaning towards monastic institutions. Of his discoveries in any
                    region of science posterity will be able to speak but little; but in his

                must give him an honourable place among those writers who deck
                    philosophy with the ornamented diction and the flowers of fancy.</p>
            <p>It should not be forgotten to be noticed in praise of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Rasselas</hi>
               </title>, that it is, as well as all
                    the other works of its author, perfectly pure. In describing the happy valley,
                    he has not, as many authors would have done, painted a luxurious bower of bliss,
                    nor once throughout the work awakened any ideas which might be at variance with
                    the moral truths which all his writings are meant to inculcate.</p>
