                     anchored="true">[Note to "The
                  Ritter Von Reichenstein":] This Austrian story has its foundation in fact. The
                  ruins of Reichenstein Castle are still visible in the district of Muhl, on the
                  river Ens; and in the chapel is the Baron's monument, finely executed by an
                  Italian master. [Fraser and/or Author.]</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE great hall in the royal castle of Linz resounded with kettle-drums and trumpets,
               while King Ferdinand and his Queen sat at the banquet table, rejoicing that the siege
               was now raised, and Austria once more victorious. The banquet was given in honour of
               the young Baron von Reichenstein, who then, for the first time, appeared as the
               King's guest. He had the good fortune to bring the welcome tidings that Solyman,
               after beleaguering the city for many weeks, and being repulsed in every attack, had
               at last suddenly desisted from his undertaking, and retreated by quick marches. Of
               the distinction now conferred on Reichenstein his own noble conduct during the siege
               rendered him eminently worthy, nor could the favour have been bestowed on any one who
               would have valued it more highly, for pride and ambition were indeed his leading
               characteristics.</p>
            <pb n="115" xml:id="image150"/>
            <p>The lively monarch banished for the time all political cares, and gave himself up to
               the festivity of the moment, heightened by the consideration that the good news came
               unexpectedly, as Vienna was then, in truth, but ill provided with the means of
               defence, and the Sultan, at the head of three thousand men, had vowed never to return
               till he had conquered both Hungary and Austria, where the Christian sway should be
               terminated for ever. Merrily coursed the brimming goblets round the table, and in the
               joy of his heart the King proposed the health of his country's brave defender, the
               heroic youth, Philip Palsgraf of the Rhine, and of the veteran warrior, Count
               Nicholas of Salm, whose locks had now grown grey under arms. The mirth became louder,
               and the applause more vehement, till the Queen commanded silence and attention, for
               she too had prepared a little entertainment to celebrate the termination of that
               campaign which had threatened so much misfortune; well knowing that on such occasions
               her illustrious consort did not disdain to exchange the homage to Bacchus for a
               sacrifice to the Muses. Of this Monarch, indeed, it is recorded that when a certain
               Colonel of his Life Guards once ventured to hint that he bestowed too many favors on
               the learned, to the neglect of the ancient nobility, the Colonel next day received a
               great packet of old and important parchments, with an order that he <pb n="116" xml:id="image151"/>should read them through, and in a few hours return a written
               abstract of their contents; the Colonel, of course, brought them back, declaring his
               incapacity for the task. "Good friend," said the King, smiling ironically, "you will
               for the future spare your animadversions on our patronage of the learned, for you
               perceive that if noblemen and warriors only were to be raised to office, the duties
               of the state would be fulfilled yet worse than heretofore."</p>
            <p>On a signal from the queen a red silk curtain at the bottom of the hall was suddenly
               drawn up, and revealed an altar from which a clear flame rose flickering, and
               illuminated the arms of Austria wreathed with laurel and gorgeously emblazoned.
               Before the altar sat a female form, beaming in such luxuriance of beauty, that she
               might well indeed have been deemed one of the muses descended from Mount Olympus. Her
               long white robes though rich in folds could not conceal the exquisite symmetry of her
               form; round her waist she wore a gold embroidered girdle, while from her shoulders
               waved a short mantle of blue velvet studded with golden stars. Her features were of
               the noblest Grecian mould; round her temples was bound a laurel wreath, and her
               glossy chesnut hair flowed in profuse curls round her blushing cheeks, down into her
               snow-white neck and bosom. In her arms she supported a harp, and accompanying her
               voice with powerful chords, sung <pb n="117" xml:id="image152"/>a fervent hymn in
               praise of the brave men by whose courage the threatening danger had been averted, and
               the proud plans of the Pagan invader defeated. Impassioned eloquence or music alone
               is enough to move irresistibly every feeling heart, — but how much is that effect
               encreased , when the tones flow from lips so beautiful, when such eyes beam with the
               sacred fire of inspiration! — A watchful silence prevailed in the hall that was
               before so loud with voices; the guests had eyes and ears only for the seraphic
               musician, who exercised her power like an enchantress even over the roughest veteran
               warriors "albeit unused to the melting mood," for she recalled to them and presented
               as if in a magic mirror the fairy dreams of their youth. How vivid then must have
               been the impression on younger auditors! Involuntarily all hearts were attracted and
               won by the lovely performer — every eye glistened with pleasure, and when she had
               finished her triumphant song, every tongue was busy in her praise — even the proud
               and haughty Baron Reichenstein was deeply moved. 'Till now, the attention which had
               often been bestowed on the young warrior by susceptible beauties of the capital had
               failed to excite any other sensation but that of gratified vanity. Now, however, when
               the songstress in her chaunt alluded to him as the announcing messenger of that that
               victory which he had assisted to gain, he could <pb n="118" xml:id="image153"/>no
               longer look proudly around, as he had been wont to do. On the contrary a deep blush
               came over his features; his proud heart beat anxiously, and his fiery eagle eyes were
               humbly fixed on the ground.</p>
            <p>So the festivities of the banquet were closed, and the evening of that happy day was
               spent in dancing and games of chance. For neither of these amusements was Baron
               Reichenstein disposed. Leaning against a pillar of the Gothic Hall, he followed with
               watchful eyes every movement of the Demoiselle Appollonia von Santi, — for so the
               beautiful songstress was named. Descended from a noble Greek house, and left in early
               youth an orphan, she had been brought to the Court of King Ferdinand, and there
               educated as one of the queen's maids of honour. Her beauty, — her eminent talents for
               music, and but still more the unpretending modesty of her demeanour excited universal
               attention, and every one spoke with respect of the beautiful Lady Appollonia. No
               sooner had she made her appearance in the ball-room than Reichenstein saw that the
               young and old crowded around her, to express their thanks for the delight which her
               music had afforded, and afterwards as she whirled past him in the walk, supported by
               some gay and brilliant courtier, he was racked by a feeling of the bitterest envy;
               yet he who had before known fear scarcely by name, had <pb n="119" xml:id="image154"/>not the courage to approach her. With rapture he remarked, that even during the
               dance, his eyes often encountered hers, and when she seated herself for refreshment
               and rest, her looks again followed him as if she would say — "And you alone
               determined not to share in the pleasures of these fleeting hours?" So at last he
               mustered resolution, humbly approached the victorious enchantress, and in a
               faultering half audible voice begged that he might have the honour of her hand for
               the next dance. Appollonia blushed and courtesied her consent; the warlike hero made
               an awkward bow, and retreated, not daring to say more, 'till the music recommencing
               called them to their places. Reichenstein, who was usually a good waltzer could now
               scarcely keep in time, while his lovely partner seemed to partake of his
               embarrassment, yet this was but for a few minutes; her sparkling eyes and approving
               smiles soon roused him to self-possession. Even the musicians seemed inspired; they
               played louder, and with more precision. Envied by many a youth in the numerous
               assemblage, he flew down the ranks, with the peerless Grecian on his arm, and all
               allowed that there never was seen a more beautiful couple. On returning to their
               seats, Appollonia challenged her partner to give her some account of the Blockade.
               Reichenstein had now recovered from his awkward timidity, and contrived to tell his
               story with un-<pb n="120" xml:id="image155"/>wonted eloquence, enlivened and rewarded
               all the while by the approbation which he read unequivocally in the bright eyes of
               his auditress. Appollonia's attention was indeed so absorbed that she forgot the
               dance, and the presence of the court, so that the marshal was obliged to remind her
               of her duty, for the queen had already proposed to break up the party.</p>
            <p>Henceforward Reichenstein saw the young lady almost every day, and continued always
               to discover new charms and fresh virtues, — and this at length drew from him a
               confession of his love, and a request for her hand in marriage. Appollonia in answer
               explained to him that her fate depended on the king, who had hitherto acted towards
               her as a father, and who therefore possessed the full parental authority.
               Reichenstein heard this with fear and trembling; for he suspected that Ferdinand
               might have other views for his fair adopted daughter. He knew how much the king
               delighted in Appollonia's talents, by which his mind was often exhilarated after the
               cares of public business, and with which amusement it could not be supposed that he
               would willingly dispense. It was necessary therefore to watch for some favourable
               opportunity, when the king should appear in especial good humour, before the subject
               could be broached, and ere long, such a fitting occasion presented itself to the
               anxious lover.</p>
            <pb n="121" xml:id="image156"/>
            <p>The disaffected Bohemians, whom Ferdinand had a few years ago severely chastised,
               happened to lose by an accidental fire great part of the national archives, and their
               most important charters or deed of immunity. Conscience-stricken, and fearful that
               advantage might be taken of this event, whereby they might be deprived of many
               valuable privileges, they sent a deputation to Linz, in order to treat with their
               monarch on the subject. Scarcely had Ferdinand heard their preamble, when he
               exclaimed angrily — "Your charters may be destroyed, but our imperial promise, and
               principles of integrity, are not destroyed along with them. All the rights and
               privileges of which this fire has robbed you, we shall renew; and, where there is
               doubt, rather than give you less, we shall make your advantages greater than before."
               Of that scene Reichenstein was a witness. "No," said he to himself, "it is impossible
               that a sovereign, who is thus so mild and equitable, should be harsh to me alone."
               And no sooner had the ashamed representatives left the audience-hall, than he threw
               himself at Ferdinand's feet, and stammered out his request. For a few moments he was,
               indeed, kept in agonising suspense, while the king looked at him silently and with a
               very grave aspect. At length he made a sign for the supplicant to rise, and said, "I
               cannot conceal that I shall be very unwilling to part with Mademoiselle de Santi. In
                  <pb n="122" xml:id="image157"/>her delightful music I must lose one of the best
               enjoyments of my life; — yet far be it from me to interfere on any selfish
               principles, with her future prospects or yours; — take her then, and be happy."</p>
            <p>What language could adequately describe the rapture of the lovers! Soon after, their
               marriage was solemnized with princely magnificence, and Reichenstein took his young
               bride to the family castle from which he derived his title, and which was situated in
               Upper Austria, in one of the most attractive districts of that beautiful country.
               Then, from far and near, flocked visitors to pay their homage at the festal mansion,
               more attracted, however, by the wondrous musical talents of the bride, than by the
               hospitable manners of the castle's lord. The young noblemen of the neighbourhood,
               especially, were numerous and unwearied in their attentions; and their admiration of
               the Lady von Reichenstein's improvisator songs was beyond measure fervent. The
               baron's pride was at first flattered by such universal applause; but that feeling
               soon yielded to another very different emotion. He began to fear that it was not
               merely the delight they experienced from her music, but much more their admiration of
               Appollonia's personal charms, which shone in the eyes of these gay and idle youths,
               so that by degrees jealously more and more deeply fixed her serpent stings into his
               very <pb n="123" xml:id="image158"/>heart. Yet far too proud to confess that he had
               become the prey of a passion so despicable, and sensible that her conduct was too
               scrupulously correct to warrant his avowal of any suspicions, he concealed his
               irritability as much as possible, though many times, by gloomy silence, or short
               monosyllabic answers, did he betray his inward discontent. Appollonia, conscious of
               her own innocence, was completely at a loss to fix on any cause for this change, and
               enquired anxiously the reason of his distress, — whereupon the proud baron, instead
               of imparting at once the source of his grief, and thus, for ever banishing the demon
               that haunted his house, was either moodily silent as before, or ascribed his
               depression to a transient attack of illness.</p>
            <p>Love is sharp-sighted. Appollonia thought that she had at last found out the real
               cause of his displeasure; and under the pretext that their present mode of life was
               far too fatiguing, she begged him to dismiss their guests, in order that they might
               henceforth live in retirement: but how could Reichenstein's haughty spirit submit to
               the idea of having appeared as a jealous husband? He insisted that the castle of his
               ancestors must remain open to every guest; and when Appollonia, under various
               pretences withdrew to the solitude of her own apartments, and the visitors with
               regret commented on <pb n="124" xml:id="image159"/>the absence of their beautiful
               hostess — but especially when ironical hints and conjectures were whispered round the
               festal board, regarding the reasons for her disappearance, his pride was more than
               ever wounded. He therefore entreated Appollonia, nay, commanded her, to appear as
               formerly at every banquet, and to enliven his guests by the exercise of her magic
               art. Under these circumstances, concluding that her former suppositions had been
               altogether erroneous, she obeyed him willingly, without disguising that the incense
               of praise lavishly bestowed was welcome and acceptable to her female heart.
               Reichenstein's gloomy discontent now increased visibly from day to day, and it was
               only in the presence of strangers that his jealousy was overcome or concealed by the
               determination to appear gay and unembarrassed. In vain did his affectionate wife
               enquire into the cause of such inexplicable conduct. Two whole years thus passed
               away, during which that abode of his ancestors, where the spirit of domestic
               happiness should have woven for him the richest and brightest wreaths, was changed by
               his own imperious temper, and haughty and foolish reserve, into a cell of torment and
               ceaseless disquietude.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Solyman, in order to revenge himself for the loss and disgrace which he had
                  encoun-<pb n="125" xml:id="image160"/>tered, prepared to renew the war more
               formidably than ever, and made such an attack on Styria and Austria, that the Emperor
               Charles, in person, at the head of a considerable army, came to the assistance of the
               king, his illustrious brother. Ferdinand at the same time hastened to collect around
               him his faithful troops, and the rumour of these proceedings having reached the
               secluded castle of Reichenstein, the baron determined that he would immediately
               resume the duties of his station in the army. He had not yet been summoned; but alas!
               in his home there was no longer any domestic happiness that could induce him to
               remain there. In his wayward self-delusions he had cast it away; and in the tumult of
               the battle-field he best hoped to forget his vexations.</p>
            <p>The news of this approaching separation struck fearfully on the already wounded heart
               of Appollonia. When the dreadful hour of parting arrived, her anguish was indeed most
               sincere and overpowering, yet her foolish husband imagined that her tears and
               complaints were but a mask under which she concealed her joy at the prospect of being
               able in future to follow her inclinations without restraint. Unmoved, therefore, and
               sternly, he tore himself from her affectionate embraces, and galloped away, spurring
               his foaming charger, even as the <pb n="126" xml:id="image161"/>demons of jealousy
               and distrust goaded him on in his insane career.</p>
            <p>Now the once gay castle of Reichenstein became silent as a hermitage; — and like a
               widow mourning the death of a beloved husband, Appollonia withdrew from all society,
               living only for the care of his property, and ceaseless prayers for his welfare and
               preservation. Often at the midnight hour her attendants found her still at her
               earnest devotions, or listened with respectful sympathy as she touched her harp, and
               with tearful eyes expressed her grief, and even her prayers, in low faultering
               melody.</p>
            <p>Day after day, week after week dragged on, but no news arrived of Reichenstein,
               though she had earnestly requested that he would write to her. At length she found
               herself quite unable any longer to bear the racking pains of suspense, and dispatched
               her Castellan, a man of years and experience, with orders that he should make his way
               to the royal army, and by no means to return without some intelligence of her beloved
               husband. The interval of her messenger's absence she spent in continued prayer, and
               in acts of charity and benevolence.</p>
            <p>When the Castellan's return was announced, he was summoned immediately to her
               presence, but alas! — his features wore an expression of deep grief <pb n="127" xml:id="image162"/>and disappointment. "Merciful God!" cried she, "my worst fears
               are then realized — and I shall never see him more!" She fainted, and not without
               great care and skill could her attendants restore her to self-possession — then it
               seemed that by direful and heroic exertion she had resolved to conquer her emotion,
               yet her bosom heaved convulsively, and her lips and eyelids quivered. "Speak on,"
               said she in a hollow voic — "relate all that thou know'st." "Forgive me," noble lady,
               said the messenger — "but I fear you are not well enough now to hear such tidings."
               "I know already that which is most appalling," answered she, "thou canst not tell me
               aught that could wound more deeply — say then, how and where did he die?" "Die!"
               exclaimed the Castellan — "God forbid that he should die — no, of this much be
               assured, your noble husband lives." "Lives!" exclaimed Appollonia, in a voice like
               that of the condemned victim on the scaffold, in whose ears for the first time sounds
               the voice of pardon, and who fears he may yet be deluded. — "Lives — saidst thou —
               lives?" "Aye indeed," said the Castellan, "but the Baron von Reichenstein is now a
               Turkish prisoner." "Oh, heaven be praised!" cried the enraptured wife, "his life then
               is yet spared;" and she fell on her knees, uplifting her clasped hands in fervent
               gratitude to the Giver of all Good for his <pb n="128" xml:id="image163"/>mercy.
               Thereafter she listened with calm attention to the Castellan's narrative.
               Reichenstein had been placed with a corps which was destined to oppose that of
               Michael Oglu, who was forcing his way with the van of the Turkish army over the
               Sommering mountains. In the heat of battle the Baron had advanced too far; he was
               quickly surrounded, and after a brave resistance, taken prisoner, and dragged away by
               the repulsed and fugitive Turks. Intelligence had been subsequently received by means
               of deserters, that he had fallen into the power of the Bassa of Belgrade, who, in
               consequence of his severe wounds, had obtained permission to return home, and had
               taken with him to his own country all his prisoners. "So then he lives — he is at
               Belgrade," cried Appollonia, "and there is hope that I may yet again call him mine!"
               With these words her tears flowed more freely than ever, but they were now tears of
               joy.</p>
            <p>For the rest of that day she remained shut up in her chamber, she would not speak
               with any one, nor accept of refreshment, but in the evening the castle chaplain was
               summoned to her presence. To him she explained that some affairs of great urgency and
               importance obliged her to go forthwith to the Queen's Court at Linz, and as the
               Castellan must attend her on the journey, the chaplain should, in their absence, <pb n="129" xml:id="image164"/>use every means in his power for the due guardianship
               of the castle. The grey-headed priest not knowing the purpose of her journey, did not
               venture to remonstrate, and only implored that as her affectionate servants and
               vassals would deeply grieve for her absence, she would not long defer her return.
               With visible emotion she then took leave of her domestics, and at the earliest dawn
               of the next day, followed by the old castellan, and the blessing of all the Baron's
               vassals, she departed, taking with her only her harp, and wearing apparel.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Ritter von Reichenstein was obliged to fulfil menial drudgery as a
               slave in the gardens of Ibrahim, Bassa of Belgrade. At that time it happened that in
               his Harem there prevailed great affliction; Fatima, the most beautiful and beloved of
               his wives, had been driven to distraction by the death of her first-born infant
               child, and the violence of her sorrow had given way to an apathy and indifference
               which amounted to insanity. The unhappy Ibrahim offered the largest rewards for
               assistance, and tired every method to save his favourite from that untimely death to
               which the continuance of her malady would certainly lead. The most skilful physicians
               had recourse to all expedients of their art, but in vain; so that with an almost
               broken heart, Ibrahim saw that she was rapidly sinking into the grave.</p>
            <pb n="130" xml:id="image165"/>
            <p>One evening when he was under the dominion of these painful reflections, it was
               announced that a Grecian youth had made his appearance at Belgrade as a harp player
               and singer, with whose music every listener had been enraptured, and who had begged
               permission to prove his talents before the Bassa. Ibrahim gladly availed himself of
               the opportunity to obtain some diversion from his own gloomy thoughts; he desired
               that the stranger should be admitted forthwith, and was so much delighted with the
               youth's performance that as long as the music continued he quite forgot his usual
               sufferings. Thereafter the question occurred to him whether that magic art which had
               such influence over his emotions might not also alleviate the malady of his beloved
               Fatima. He imparted this idea to the stranger, who encouraged his hopes, and assured
               him that many instances were on record of insane persons being altogether restored to
               health by the power of music. "Should'st thou succeed in this attempt," cried the
               rejoiced Bassa, "then demand what thou wilt — no reward is too great, when the
               service performed is the preservation of my dearest Fatima."</p>
            <p>The Greek youth was duly instructed in the cause and symptoms of the malady, and
               undertook its cure. The attempt succeeded even beyond expectation. At first he was
               concealed behind a veranda, and ventured only to sing the most melan-<pb n="131" xml:id="image166"/>choly lays in soft and long protracted notes, to which for some
               time Fatima seemed, as usual, indifferent, but by degrees her attention was roused,
               and she listened with visibly increasing interest. While the music continued, her
               beautiful features were once more animated, a slight tinge of colour rose into her
               cheeks, and a lambent fire shone in her eyes, but as the tones died away into silence
               she declined again into her wonted mournful apathy. By degrees she began to watch
               every word of the youth's songs, which like the music were plaintive and desponding,
               till her bosom heaved, and she wept unconsciously. Thus the trial was repeated for
               several successive days, and as often as the hour drew near which was appointed for
               the musician's attendance, she expressed anxiety and impatience; nay, once when by
               some accident he had been detained, she enquired if they intended to deprive her of
               her only remaining consolation. These words were the first that she had been heard to
               utter for many weeks, and from henceforward the Greek, at her request, came earlier,
               and remained longer. By degrees, too, he ventured to introduce songs that were less
               mournful, and the listener seemed even more gratified than before, till at length she
               begged to see the wonderful musician by whom she had been thus delighted; and even
               requested that he would give her instructions in his divine art. He obeyed <pb n="132" xml:id="image167"/>willingly, and Fatima had soon learned a few simple
               ballads, which she practised passionately night and day, thus forgetting her
               misfortunes, so that she was ere long restored to perfect health.</p>
            <p>The Bassa, rejoiced beyond measure at this result, did not fail to send for the
               musician. "Thou hast fulfilled thy promise," said he, "now demand thy reward, in
               order that I also may behave honourably. Be not afraid to ask too much, for Allah has
               made me rich by his exceeding bounties, but for the preservation of my best and
               dearest treasure I am indebted to thee." "Sir," answered the youth, "there is in the
               gardens of your Harem a noble German soldier, the Ritter von Reichenstein, a captive
               who now labours there as a slave. It so happens that I have been deeply indebted to
               his house, and therefore if you are pleased to give up to me the liberty of this man,
               I shall be amply and richly rewarded." "Take him hence then," said the Bassa, "and
               along with him, if thou wilt, ten of his fellow soldiers, who have hitherto shared
               his fate. Moreover, it shall not be said that the Bassa Ibrahim sent any man out into
               the wide world to find his way home as a mendicant; he shall therefore be amply
               provided for; and thou, too, modest youth, shalt not leave my palace unrewarded."
               Hereupon Ibrahim summoned the overseer of his slaves, commanding him to lead the
               Greek youth into the prison of the Christians, to <pb n="133" xml:id="image168"/>inform the Baron and his companions that they were free, and present to them the
               noble Greek youth as their deliverer. In vain did the humble minstrel strive against
               this — the Bassa's resolution was inexorable, "for it is no more than justice," said
               he, "that these Christian dogs should learn to know their benefactor, and offer him
               due thanks for his disinterested benevolence."</p>
            <p>Miserable embarrassed, the young Greek followed the overseer, and entered a gloomy
               prison, where the captives were seated on the damp ground, strewed with rushes. No
               sooner had the overseer announced the purpose of his message than the overjoyed
               exiles threw themselves at their deliverer's feet, even kissed the hem of his
               garment, and wept in their excess of gratitude. "Be thankful to God," said the youth,
               in a faultering, scarce audible tone, "and may Providence guide you on your homeward
               journey!" "Stay, noble stranger," cried Reichenstein, as the minstrel would have
               hastily retired — "if you will not listen to our humble protestations of gratitude,
               yet at least accept from my hands this insignificant ring. Should you, or any of your
               friends ever come to Germany, and pass near the castle of Reichenstein, this little
               token will open for the traveller a new home, and make him an acknowledged inmate of
               a noble family, whose last remaining chief you <pb n="134" xml:id="image169"/>have
               thus contributed to uphold." "We shall meet again," stammered the youth, with obvious
               emotion, and taking the ring, rushed from the prison as though he dared not trust
               himself in any farther colloquy.</p>
            <p>The Bassa's promises were faithfully fulfilled. Enriched by valuable presents, and
               attended by a secure escort, Reichenstein, along with his companions, left Belgrade.
               They arrived in safety at the Christian camp, and were all most kindly received by
               King Ferdinand, especially Reichenstein, who still expressed his wish and resolution
               to remain with the army. "In the first place," answered the King, "it is our will and
               pleasure that you should appear before her Majesty at Linz. Should your inclinations
               alter when there, which I hope may be the case, you shall have free leave of absence
               from your military duties, for after the oppressions you have undergone, this
               indulgence is but just and necessary. If however your determination should remain
               unshaken, the presence of so brave a soldier as the Baron von Reichenstein will
               always be welcome to our army."</p>
            <p>In the royal palace of Linz, after an interval of three years, the baron once more
               sat in the great hall at the banquet table, though now the party was less numerous,
               consisting only of the queen, her maids of honour, and some old coutiers. He <pb n="135" xml:id="image170"/>again beheld the same golden framework of the folding
               doors, and the same red curtain which had formerly risen at the queen's signal, and
               afforded the first view of that peerless beauty, whom afterwards he was so fortunate
               as to call his own. With bitter regret he thought of that happy day, and all the
               fairy visions that had shone so brightly, and were now fled for ever. He sighed
               deeply, and the queen observing his distress, interrupted his contemplations with the
               words — "If I interpret your looks aright, that curtain revives recollections of the
               good fortune, which was here unexpectedly prepared for you, and I can well explain
               that sigh with which your longing heart has reverted to home and a beloved wife." A
               cloud came over Reichenstein's expressive features, and a yet deeper sigh was his
               only answer.</p>
            <p>"Nay, then, perhaps you have received some disquieting letters," said the queen, "and
               I doubt not that Appollonia's grief at your long absence — "</p>
            <p>"Appollonia's grief, indeed!" interrupted the baron with bitter irony; "your majesty
               must forgive me if I venture to doubt that any such cause — "</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay," answered the queen, "we must hear no more of this. I shall not allow
               myself to believe that unworthy suspicions could ever find harbour in your bosom. For
               the present, let us hear <pb n="136" xml:id="image171"/>minutely how you contrived to
               escape from the Turkish prison?"</p>
            <p>The Ritter went through his narrative accordingly.</p>
            <p>"But your deliverer," observed the queen; "that noble-hearted Greek — have you then
               never seen him since your meeting in prison?"</p>
            <p>"Alas, no!" answered the baron; "and the manner in which he then took leave obliges
               me to fear that I shall never in this world be so happy as to see my generous
               benefactor again, in order to prove how deep and sincere is my gratitude."</p>
            <p>"While there is life there is hope," said the queen; "could you have believed, three
               years ago, that yonder curtain, which you no doubt looked on with contempt, concealed
               the beautiful songstress, who was destined to be your loving wife? What should you
               think, if its mystic folds should once more expand, and reveal the person of your
               kind deliverer?"</p>
            <p>"Your majesty is pleased to jest," said the baron with a melancholy smile.</p>
            <p>"Let us try," said the queen, "whether it is impossible to convert his infidel;" and
               at her signal the curtain was again drawn up. Again he saw the altar from which a
               bright flame rose and illuminated, not the Austrian arms, but those of the noble
               house <pb n="137" xml:id="image172"/>of Reichenstein; while beneath stood the Grecian
               youth, his large hat slouched over his features, and leaning on his harp.</p>
            <p>"Is it possible? my deliverer! my benefactor!" cried Reichenstein, and then rushed up
               to the apparition. At that moment the pilgrim's hat fell off; the grey-coloured dress
               was thrown aside; and Appollonia smiling in all her wonted loveliness, while tears of
               joy shone in her eyes, presented to him the ring which he had given as a token to the
               wandering minstrel. He stood silent and confounded.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said the queen in a solemn voice, "she it was — your affectionate and faithful
               wife, whom not all the fatigues and dangers of so long a journey could deter from her
               undertaking, to redeem out of wretched thralldom that still beloved husband, who, too
               haughty to confess the injustice of which he had been guilty, had destroyed her
               happiness and his own."</p>
            <p>Reichenstein meanwhile throwing himself prostrate on the ground, and forgetting all
               his wonted pride, had hidden his face in the folds of her garment. Appollonia would
               have raised him up, but he exclaimed vehemently, though in a voice broken by his
               emotion — "Never more dare I lift up mine eyes to her whom I have thus injured! No
               penance no humiliation can atone for that guilt which now <pb n="138" xml:id="image173"/>cleaves to my conscience and of which the stain will never be
               effaced."</p>
            <p>"Nay," said Appollonia, "knowst thou not that of all duties in this world, there is
               none more easy for true love than to forgive, — that the fond heart may indeed be
               wounded and broken by faults, mistrust and injuries, yet will never thus be alienated
               from its idol?"</p>
            <p>So the happy couple rushed into each others embrace, forgetful of the spectators and
               all the world — nor was there one individual present, who did not sympathize in their
               emotion; even the queen herself burst into tears. Henceforward, Reichenstein
               cherished no other pride but that founded on possession of the most beautiful and
               faithful of wives. The Bassa of Belgrade's gifts might increase his worldly wealth,
               but not his happiness, for in the tried attachment of Appollonia, he had secured the
               richest of all earthly treasures; mutually placing unbounded confidences in each
               other, their path of life was evermore cheered by sunshine and strown with
               flowers.</p>
