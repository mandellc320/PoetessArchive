					which may be applied on all occasions—"Judge not" is the general
					motto. Take the actions of our nearest friends, and how little do we know of the
					hopes that instigated, or of the fears that prevailed! We sometimes cannot avoid
					owning that we ourselves have committed a fault, but how we gloss it
					over—how we take temperament and temptation into account, till at length
					it appears to be a thing inevitable—redeemed by the regret it has
					occasioned, and the lesson it has given. Not so do we reason for
					others—then we look to the isolated fact, not to the causes: the error
					shuts out the excuse. The truth is, we know nothing of each other excepting by
					the aid of philosophy and of poetry; philosophy, that analyzes our thoughts, and
					poetry that expresses our feelings. Little of the examination of the one, or of
					the tenderness of the other, enters into our daily opinions, and yet by them we
					alone know the hidden heart within. "Judge not" is the first great
					rule of the moral world; it is equally applicable to the literary one. Yesterday
					is constantly reversing the decree of to-day; our notion of our contemporaries
					is biassed in many ways—vanities, envyings, and prejudices are things

					leveller, but he is also the sanctifier and the beautifier. If our judgement,
					then, of our own literature be liable to so many objections, what must it be
					when we attempt to decide on that of a foreign nation; the maxim, "Judge
					not," must indeed be the first principle laid down. No stranger can enter
					into one great charm thrown around the poetry of every country—namely,
					that of association. Unconsciously to ourselves, we connect with our favourite
					writers the emotions which first made us seek in them for expression, and with
					the scenes amid which we turned their pages. Did we read them in summer, under
					the silver shiver of the aspen?—they have gathered to themselves the
					sunshine raining through the leaves, and the freshness on the open air. Were
					they our companions by the hearth-side on a long winter evening?—they are
					linked with pleasant memories of comfort and of home. It is impossible for a
					stranger to share these subtle sympathies, and yet their atmosphere is around
					the literature of every nation. But literary, like all other commerce, has its
					incalculable advantages: the merchant brings with him not only wealth, but
					knowledge. Communication is in itself civilization; we wear away our own
					prejudices only by contact with those of others. We are forced into making
					allowances, by seeing how much we need that they should be made for ourselves. </p>

               <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> says, in an
					admirable spirit of candour, "In living literature no person is a competent
					judge but of works written in his own language. I have expressed my opinion
					concerning a number of English writers; it is very possible that I may be
					mistaken, that my admiration and my censure may be equally misplaced, and that
					my conclusions may appear impertinent and ridiculous on the other side of the

					whole life has been a poet's education, and he has studied our literature
					next to his own. But there is something in the French and the English character
					so essentially opposed, that it is impossible for them to understand each other.
					Now a nation's character is in its literature. Some writer says, "The
					great difference of the two nations is, that the one lives out of doors and the
					other in; the one thinks of the people that are looking at him, and the other
					thinks of himself."<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> This principle will account for the frequent
					self-reference in these pages, which, however, has more the appearance than the
					reality of vanity. An Englishman is timid of drawing attention to
					himself—he is afraid of being laughed at; a Frenchman, on the contrary,
					relies on your indulgence. <ref target="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</ref> believes that genius is a moral problem, which it is

					by democratic talent. The man of ability found in the church his theatre of
					action; all other avenues to power or to distinction were barred by the sword,
					which was given as a birthright to the noble. But in the ranks of the Catholic
					faith the equality, or rather the superiority of intellect was asserted; and
					when king and chief knelt at the chair of St. Peter, it was the triumph of
					thought over strength—it was the weak mind subjugated by the strong. But,
					as usual, the authority outlived its necessity—other influences began
					their activity; and again, as usual, one of those men arose who embody their
					epoch, and carry its spirit into action. That man was <ref target="people.html#LutherMartin">Luther</ref>. He was an
					enthusiast—enthusiasm is needed for action; calculation never
					acts—it is a passive principle. He was fierce, angry, and governed by

					but impulse is from Heaven." These qualities only the better fitted the

					We should say this arises from having no standard of comparison by which to try
					the merits of "Paradise Lost." There is nothing like it in French
					literature, and the critic has no preconceived notions to whose test the foreign
					work must submit. In speaking of the drama, he is fettered by early associations
					of admiration, links as slight as those charmed threads Monimia wound the hands

            <p> Fame is but a beautiful classic delusion. The inspiration of the poet is like
					the inspiration of the Delphic oracles: what was once held divine is now
					confessed the promptings of an evil spirit mocking the votaries of whom it made
					victims. We firmly believe that the time is fast approaching when no more books
					will be written. The once writers will say—"Why should we sacrifice
					our whole existence to obtain a vain praise, which, after all, never comes
					sufficiently home to us to be enjoyed? Why should we devote, to this most barren
					pursuit, industry<milestone unit="signature" n="F2" rendition="#center"/>
               <pb n="68"/> and talent, which in any other line, would be certain of that
					worldly success, which, as we live in the world, is the only success to be
					desired?" Even poets must at last learn wisdom. The bitterness and
					hollowness of praise will be perceived; and then who will be at the trouble of
					writing a book? Again we repeat, the time is fast approaching when no more books
					will be written. </p>
