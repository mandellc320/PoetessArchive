            <p>I WISH, indeed, Servius, as you write, that you had been here when this misfortune
               befel [sic] me; for I easily understand from the quiet the reading of your letters
               administered to me, how much if you had been present, you might have assisted in
               consoling me, and almost equally sharing in my grief; for you have not only written
               such things as have alleviated my grief, but have very kindly sympathized with me.
               However you son Servius has testified by all those serviceswhich could be rendered to
               me, not only how much he esteems me, but how much he thinks you will be pleased with
               his kindness towards me *** whose good offices, though often upon pleasanter
               occasions, have never been more welcome to me than at this time. But it is not what
               you say in your letter, and the share you take in my affliction, but your authority
               also which has consoled me; for I think it unworthy of me not to bear my mis-<pb n="189" xml:id="image228"/>fortune, as you who are endowed with so much wisdom,
               think I ought to do. But I am sometimes oppressed, and can hardly resist my grief;
               because those comforts are wanting which were not wanting to these, whom I have
               proposed to myself as patterns. For both Q. Maximus, who lost his son after he had
               been consul, and rendered himself famous by great actions; and L. Paulus, who was
               deprived of two sons in the compass of seven days, as well as your Gallus and Marcus;
               Cato who left a son of the greatest genius and virtue, all these lived at a time when
               their own dignity, which they had received at the hands of the republic, was alone
               able to alleviate their grief. But after I had lost those ornaments which you have
               mentioned, and which I had with much labour obtained, this was the only comfort left
               me, which I am now deprived of.</p>
            <p>My thoughts were not employed on the affairs of friends, or in the affairs of the
               republic. It was irksome to me to do any thing in the Forum, and I could not even
               bear the sight of the Senate House. I thought what was very true, that I had lost all
               the fruits of my industry and fortune. Yet when I reflected that these things were
               common to me with you and many others; and when I was forcing myself to bear these
               things tolerably, I had a person to whom I could fly, with whom I could be at east,
               and in whose conversation and sweetness of manners I could lose all my cares and
               vexations. But this has opened<pb n="190" xml:id="image229"/>again all my former
               wounds, which appeared to be healing. For it is not now as it was then, when my
               family relieved my concern for the affairs of the republic; neither can I fly for
               consolation under my private misfortunes to the prosperity of the republic. Therefore
               I absent myself as well from my own house as from the forum; because my own house is
               not able now to console me under the grief which I receive from the republic, nor the
               republic under the grief which I receive from my own private affairs. Wherefore I
               anxiously wait for you, and am very desirous of seeing you. No greater pleasure can I
               now receive, than in your conversation and friendship; and I hope, and indeed have
               heard, that your return will soon afford me this consolation. I am desirous in truth
               of seeing you as soon as possible for many reasons, but particularly that we may
               settle together our plan of life in this conjecture, which must be arranged according
               to the will of one man, who is prudent and liberal, a great friend as I conceive of
               yours, and no enemy of mine. Still it demands no small deliberation what measures we
               must take; I do not mean for acting, but for remaining quiet, with his permission and
               good will. Farewell.</p>
