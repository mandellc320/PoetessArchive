                    Her original works are some comedies, and a number of novels, of which latter

                    <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Female Quixote</hi></title>, published in
                    1752, is an agreeable and ingenious satire upon the old romances; not the more
                    ancient ones of chivalry, but the languishing love romances of the <ref
                        target="people.html#LaCalprenede">Calpren&#233;de</ref>s and <ref
                        target="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Scuderi</ref>s. Arabella, the heroine,
                    is supposed to have been brought up in the country, and secluded, during the
                    life of her father, from all society, but allowed to amuse herself in an old
                    library furnished with the works of those voluminous authors. Of course she <fw

                    <pb n="ii"/>imbibes their sentiments, and at her father&apos;s death she comes
                    out into the world, possessed of beauty and fortune, but with a profound
                    ignorance of every circumstance of real life and manners. She fancies every man
                    who speaks to her to be secretly in love with her, and is in continual
                    apprehensions of being forcibly carried off. The gardener she imagines to be a
                    prince in disguise, and is extremely shocked when her supposed lover is turned
                    away for stealing carp. Meantime she is beloved by her cousin, an amiable young
                    gentleman and every way suitable to her; nor has she any dislike to her admirer,
                    but that she finds him very deficient in the code of gallantry prescribed by her
                    favourite authors. She insists upon his reading some of them; but not having
                    brought to the task a sufficient degree of attention, he gets into disgrace with
                    her by not knowing that Orontes and Orondates are the same person; which betrays
                    that he has not read as far as she had enjoined him. Many other incidents have a
                    good deal of humour. Arabella, for instance, calls a lady&apos;s waiting-maid
                    into her closet, and gravely desires her to relate, according to immemorial
                    custom, the <hi rendition="#italics">adventures</hi> of her lady. The surprise
                    of the waiting-maid is extreme; the more, as her lady happens to have had some
                    adventures of a nature she would not wish to be talked of. </p>
                <p> The falsification of history in these romances, which was the fault <ref
                        target="people.html#Boileau">Boileau</ref> chiefly exposed in his satire, is
                    agreeably ridiculed by the incident of a conversation which passes between the
                    heroine and a gentleman who is introduced to her <pb n="iii"/>as one who
                    possesses a great knowledge of history and of the ancients, and whom she
                    strangely perplexes by questions and anecdotes of Cyrus, and Cletia, and
                    Horatius Cocles,<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">Characters in the
                            various French fictions that <ref target="people.html#LennoxCharlotte"

                        figures.</note></hi> which he cannot explain or answer by any information
                    his reading has furnished him with. The young lady&apos;s cousin is represented
                    as more patient of her extravagancies than most modern lovers would be; but she
                    is painted as amiable, and, like <ref target="people.html#DonQuixote">Don
                        Quixote</ref>, rational in every respect where her particular whim is not
                    touched.</p>
                <p> The work is rather spun out too much, and not very well wound up. The grave
                    moralizing of a clergyman is not the means by which the heroine should have been
                    cured of her reveries. She should have been recovered by the sense of ridicule;
                    by falling into some absurd mistake, or by finding herself on the brink of
                    becoming the prey of some romantic footman, like the ladies in <ref
                        target="people.html#Moliere">Moliere</ref>&apos;s piece of <title><hi
                            rendition="#italics">Les Pr&#233;cieuses Ridicules</hi></title>, the
                    ridicule of which has pretty much the same bearing.</p>
                <p> The performance of <ref target="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</ref>
                    is the best of the various <hi rendition="#italics">Quixotes</hi> which have
                    been written in imitation of the immortal <ref target="people.html#Cervantes"
                        >Cervantes</ref>, and forms a fair counterpart to it, as it presents a
                    similar extravagance, yet drawn from a later class of authors, and more adapted
                    to female reading. It has also one disadvantage in common with that work,
                    namely, that the satire has now no object. Most young ladies of the present day,
                    instead of requiring to be cured of reading those bulky romances, would acquire
                        <pb n="iv"/>the first information of their manner from the work designed to
                    ridicule them. </p>
                <p> It is observable that <ref target="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</ref>, as <ref
                        target="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</ref> asserts, has borrowed
                    characters and incidents in his plays from these works. No doubt there were many
                    things in them to admire; nor is it very improbable that, in the rage for
                    reviving every thing that is old, they may make their appearance again in a
                    modern quarto of hot-pressed paper, with a life and an engraving from the
                    original portrait of <ref target="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Mad<hi
                            rendition="#sup">lle</hi> Scudery</ref> by <ref

                <p> The style of <ref target="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</ref> is
                    easy, but it does not rise to the elegance attained by many more modern female

                <p> Her <title><hi rendition="#italics">Henrietta</hi></title> is not without merit.
                    It begins with the incident of two young ladies who are perfect strangers to
                    each other, meeting in a stage-coach, when, after a few minutes conversation,
                    one of them exclaims, &quot;Let us swear an eternal friendship,&quot;&#8212;the
