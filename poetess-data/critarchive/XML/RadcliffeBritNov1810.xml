                    which easily suggests the ideas of commerce with it. Solitude, darkness,
                    low-whispered sounds, obscure glimpses of objects, flitting forms, tend to raise
                    in the mind that thrilling, mysterious terror, which has for its object the

                            Radcliffe&apos;s third. While Barbauld might almost be justified in

                    the machinations of a profligate villain and his agent against an amiable and
                    unprotected girl, whose birth and fortunes have been involved in obscurity by
                    crime and perfidy. The character of La Motte, the agent, is drawn with spirit.
                    He is represented as weak and timid, gloomy and arbitrary in his family, drawn
                    by extravagance into vice and atrocious actions; capable of remorse, but not
                    capable of withstanding temptation. There is a <pb n="iii"/>scene between him
                    and the more hardened marquis, who is tempting him to commit murder, which has
                    far more nature and truth than the admired scene between King John and
                        Hubert, in which the writer&apos;s imagination has led him
                    rather to represent the action to which the king is endeavouring to work his
                    instrument, as it would be seen by a person who had a great horror of its guilt,

                    the commission of murder, begins by attempting to lower his sense of virtue, by
                    representing it as the effect of prejudices imbibed in early youth; reminds him
                    that in many countries the stiletto is resorted to without scruple; treats as
                    trivial his former deviations from integrity; and, by lulling his conscience and
                    awakening his cupidity, draws him to his purpose. </p>

                <p> There are many situations in this novel which strike strongly upon the
                    imagination. Who can read without a shudder, that Adeline in her lonely chamber
                    at the abbey hardly dared to lift her eyes to the glass, lest she should see
                    another face than her own reflected from it? or who does not sympathize with her
                    feelings, when, thinking she has effected her escape with Peter, she hears a
                    strange voice, and finds herself on horseback in a dark night carried away by an
                    unknown ruffian?</p>
                <p> The next work which proceeded from <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.

                    incidents, and the nature of the feelings it is meant to excite, it abounds
                    still more with instances of mysterious and terrific appearances, but has
                    perhaps less of character, and a more imperfect story. It has been the aim in
                    this work to assemble appearances of the most impressive kind, which continually
                    present the idea of supernatural agency, but which are at length accounted for
                    by natural means. They are not always, however, <hi rendition="#italics"
                        >well</hi> accounted for; and the mind experiences a sort of disappointment
                    and shame at having felt so much from appearances which had nothing in them
                    beyond &quot;this visible diurnal sphere.&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note

                    this nature. The curtain which no one dares to undraw, interests us strongly; we
                    feel the utmost stings and throbs of curiosity; but we have been affected so
                    repeatedly, the suspense has been so long protracted, and expectation raised so

                    turns, like that, on the terrors and dangers of a young lady confined in a

                    that of La Motte; and it is a fault in the story, that its unravelling depends
                    but little on the circumstances that have previously engaged our attention.
                    Another castle is introduced; wonders are multiplied upon us; and the interest
                    we had felt in the castle of Udolpho in the Appenines, is suddenly transferred

                                    Sicilian.</hi></title></note></hi> Nothing can be finer than the
                    opening of this story. An Englishman on his travels, walking through a church,
                    sees a dark figure stealing along the aisles. He is informed that he is an
                    assassin. On expressing his astonishment that he should find shelter there, he
                    is told that such adventures are common in Italy. His companion then points to a
                    confessional in an obscure aisle of the church. &quot;There,&quot; says he,
                    &quot;in that cell, such a tale of horror was once poured into the ear of a
                    priest as overwhelmed him with astonishment, nor was the secret ever
                    disclosed.&quot; This prelude, like the tuning of an instrument by a skilful
                    hand, has the effect of producing at once in the mind a tone of feeling cor-<pb
                        n="vi"/>respondent to the future story. In this, as in the former
                    productions, the curiosity of the reader is kept upon the stretch by mystery and
                    wonder. The author seems perfectly to understand that obscurity, as <ref
                        target="people.html#BurkeEdmund">Burke</ref> has asserted, is a strong
                    ingredient in the sublime:&#8212;a face shrowded in a cowl; a narrative suddenly
                    suspended; deep guilt half revealed; the untold secrets of a prison-house; the
                    terrific shape, &quot;if shape it might be called, that shape had none
                    distinguishable;&quot;&#8212;all these affect the mind more powerfully than any
                    regular or distinct images of danger or of woe.<hi rendition="#sup"><note

                            serves Burke as one of the most powerful examples of the effect of
                            obscurity in producing ideas of the sublime.</note></hi>

                <p> But this novel has also high merit in the character of Schedoni, which is
                    strikingly drawn, as is his personal appearance. &quot;His figure,&quot; says
                    the author, &quot;was striking, but not so from grace. It was tall, and though
                    extremely thin, his limbs were large and uncouth; and as he stalked along,
                    wrapped in the black garments of his order, there was something terrible in his
                    air, something almost superhuman. His cowl too, as it threw a shade over the
                    livid paleness of his face, increased its severe character, and gave an effect
                    to his large melancholy eye which approached to horror. His physiognomy bore the
                    trace of many passions, which seemed to have fixed the features they no longer
                    animated. His eyes were so piercing that they seemed to penetrate with a single
                    glance into the hearts of men, and to read their most secret thoughts; few
                    persons could support their scrutiny, or even endure to meet them twice.&quot; A
                    striking figure for the painter to transfer to the canvass; perhaps some <pb
                        n="vii"/>picture might originally have suggested it. The scene where this
                    singular character is on the point of murdering his own daughter, as she then
                    appears to be, is truly tragical, and wrought up with great strength and pathos.
                    It is impossible not to be interested in the situation of Ellen, in the convent,
                    when her lamp goes out while she is reading a paper on which her fate depends;
                    and again when, in making her escape, she has just got to the end of the long
                    vaulted passage, and finds the door locked, and herself betrayed. The scenes of
                    the Inquisition are too much protracted, and awaken more curiosity than they
                    fully gratify; perhaps than any story can gratify.</p>
                <p> In novels of this kind, where the strong charm of suspense and mystery is
                    employed, we hurry through with suspended breath, and in a kind of agony of
                    expectation; but when we are come to the end of the story, the charm is
                    dissolved, we have no wish to read it again; we do not recur to it as we do to

                <p> There are beauties in <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.
                        Radcliffe</ref>&apos;s volumes, which would perhaps have more effect if our
                    curiosity were less excited,&#8212;for her descriptions are rich and
                    picturesque. Switzerland, the south of France, Venice, the valleys of Piedmont,
                    the bridge, the cataract, and especially the charming bay of Naples, the dances
                    of the peasants, with the vine-dressers and the fishermen, <pb n="viii"/>have
                    employed her pencil. Though love is but of a secondary interest in her story,
                    there is a good deal of tenderness in the parting scenes between Emily and
                    Valancourt in <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Mysteries of
                        Udolpho</hi></title>, when she dismisses him, who is still the object of her
                    tenderness, on account of his irregularities.</p>
                <p> It ought not to be forgotten that there are many elegant pieces of poetry
                    interspersed through the volumes of <ref target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.

                    and <title><hi rendition="#italics">The Sea Nymph</hi></title>, &quot;Down down

                    true lovers of poetry are almost apt to regret its being brought in as an
                    accompaniment to narrative, where it is generally neglected; for not one in a
                    hundred, of those who read and can judge of novels, are at all able to
                    appreciate the merits of a copy of verses, and the common reader is always
                    impatient to get on with the story.</p>
