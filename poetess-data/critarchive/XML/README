Winona -- I'm restructuring the archive as it is on my site/computer so that I can explain how it works to you better.
The xml files use the xslts to generate the HTML and RDF. 
I run the xslts in oXygen by running the "list.xml" file.
I'm still revising just a bit (the editor of this section asked for revisions and gave me updated files that need to be checked).
