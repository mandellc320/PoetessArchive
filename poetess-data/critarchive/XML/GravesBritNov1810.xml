                    and it is much to the credit of this party, that their only beverage at these
                    meetings, was water. It was about this time that he became acquainted with <ref

                    intimacy, which continued till the death of the latter, was frequently renewed

                    appear to have been a perfect coincidence of sentiment between them in matters
                    of taste; but in general there was a congeniality, and a harmony of opinion and
                    friendship, which added not inconsiderably to the happiness of both.</p>
                <p>In 1736, <ref target="people.html#GravesRichard">Mr. Graves</ref> having left
                    Pembroke, was elected a fellow of All Souls; but, instead of pursuing
                    theological studies, as he first intended, he was led to the study of physic,
                    and attended two courses of anatomical lectures in London. From this, however,
                    he was diverted by a long and dangerous illness, which left him in a very
                    languid state; and on his recovery, he resumed his original intention, and was
                    admitted to holy orders in 1740, at which time also he took his master&apos;s

                    office in his college, and was obliged to reside within a convenient distance.
                    For this purpose he lodged with a gentleman farmer in the neighbourhood, whose
                    youngest daughter, a very amiable young lady, so far captivated him, that he

                    improved his circumstances, by taking a few pupils to be educated with his
                    children. In 1763 he was presented to the living of Kilmersdon, through the

                    employed his pen on light and gay subjects, he did not commence author until the

                    Epigrams, chosen with great judgment, and prefaced by a valuable critical essay
                    on that species of composition, for which he received a silver medal, offered

                    temperance, prolonged his life free from blame and care, until his ninetieth

                <p>Of the works now enumerated, the <title>Spiritual Quixote</title>, has been by
                    far the most popular. Independent of the design, which at the time of
                    publication, was an object of some importance, the execution of it made it soon
                    be ranked among those productions which are chiefly admired for ingenuity of
                    fiction. By occasionally introducing real characters and authenticated
                    narratives, he has also diffused a charm over the whole, by which curiosity is
                    excited and gratified in the most pleasing manner. <milestone unit="signature"
