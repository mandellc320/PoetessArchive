				<p rendition="#pnoindent"><hi rendition="#largest">O</hi><hi rendition="#smcaps"
						>f</hi> all the absurd and capricious institutions which France, under
					either her old or her new <hi rendition="#italics">R&#233;gime</hi>, has
					dignified by the name of <hi rendition="#italics">Law</hi>, the modern divorce
					claims the pre-eminence for cruelty and injustice;&#8212;at least, if Madame <hi
						rendition="#italics">Dormeuil</hi>’s relation is to be
					accredited.&#8212;Mme. <hi rendition="#italics">Dormeuil</hi> was a beautiful
					and accomplished young woman, and married to a handsome and well-informed young
					man. Six years of perfect happiness they enjoyed together, and perhaps Hymen
					thought this was as large a portion of felicity as he commonly allows; for after
					this period, a degree of languor and insipidity is too often found consequent on
					a state of uninterrupted tranquility. Mons. <hi rendition="#italics"
						>Dormeuil</hi> required variety, and sought it in the scenes of dissipation;
					and hence proceeded those vicious and libertine pursuits which never fail to
					undermine the conjugal affection. Among other depravities, the <hi
						rendition="#italics">French Husband</hi> had a mistress whom he wished to
					marry; and, as the Legislature had so easily and so conveniently devised the
					means of breaking old chains, and forging new, he resolved on availing himself
					of so desirable a privilege, and being divorced from his amiable and most
					affectionate wife. Madame <hi rendition="#italics">Dormeuil</hi> protests
					against the divorce, with an obstinacy as inflexible as was that of <ref
						target="people.html#CatherineofAragon">Catherine of Arragon</ref>:&#8212;she
					protested against all the formalities necessary to ascertain the separation, and
					she insisted on keeping the name and arms of <hi rendition="#italics"
						>Dormeuil</hi>, and on being the true and <pb n="540"/>lawful wife of the old
					R&#233;gime:&#8212;she was, however, divorced against her consent, and Monsieur
					married his new Love.</p>
				<p> Of this connection, also, the inconstant husband grew tired; and he felt the
					same inclination to be emancipated from the second captivity, which had induced
					him to break the first. The matter being so easily adjusted, and the remedy for
					matrimonial ennui so immediately at hand, <hi rendition="#italics">Dormeuil</hi>
					is a second time <hi rendition="#italics">divorced</hi>; and with his first wife
					he became once more desperately in love. Her affections were never alienated
					from him, but stood the brunt of all his cruelties with the most persevering
					affection:&#8212; but the same firmness, which had directed her conduct in
					opposing the divorce, now supported her in refusing to renew the <hi
						rendition="#italics">ci-devant</hi> nuptial vow; since that act would have
					been acknowleging the <hi rendition="#italics">legality of the divorce</hi>,
					which she had with so much pertinacity refused to sanction. The situation of
					Monsieur and Madame now becomes whimsically laughable; they love each other to
					distraction: but they must not live together, and renew the conjugal
					endearments, because she <hi rendition="#italics">is not his wife</hi>, and
					would be liable to be considered as his mistress; and it would be a breach of
					good morality, which would necessarily implicate her reputation on the ground of
					decorum, were they again to inhabit the same house. We leave the reader to Mme.
						<hi rendition="#italics">Dormeuil</hi>’s own description of the caprices of
					her destiny; which she details with refined and romantic sentiments of prudery,
					truly <hi rendition="#italics">French, and extremely artificial and
						unnatural</hi>.</p>
				<p> The author informs us that he suppressed the publication of the second of these
					novels for some time, because he dared not to print it, lest a resemblance might
					be discovered between the characters which he describes, and those which
					personally existed when it was written. We have only to observe on this <hi
						rendition="#italics">head</hi>, that we give him credit for his prudence in
					taking care of his <hi rendition="#italics">own</hi>. In this novel, as in most
					others, Love is the burden of the song; and the cabals of politics, the union of
					party, and the enthusiasm of patriotism, are all superseded by the irresistible
					control of the little deity. The lovely and innocent Ad&#233;le exchanged the
					horrors of a prison for the arms of an affectionate husband, and was without
					doubt very well pleased with the bargain: at the same time, the <hi
						rendition="#italics">revolutionist</hi> most probably preserved himself from
					the guillotine by his amorous apostacy. Love was therefore the protector of
					both.</p>
				<p> The third story exhibits those romantic and self-denying practices, which the
					writers of novels dignify with the name of heroism. Our days of romance,
					however, have been so long past, that we are utterly incapable of deciding on
					the <pb n="541"/>merits or demerits of these sentimental heroines; who inflict so much misery
					on themselves, by erecting the standard of virtue on false principles.</p>
				<p> M. <hi rendition="#smcaps">Fi&#233;v&#233;e</hi>’s novels are agreeably written,
					in correct and elegant French; and, altogether, they are interesting and
					affecting.</p>
