				<p rendition="#pnoindent"><hi rendition="#largest">O</hi><hi rendition="#smcaps"
						>f</hi> the various species of composition that in course come before us,
					there are none in which <hi rendition="#italics">our</hi> writers of the male
					sex have less excelled, since the days of Richardson and Fielding, than in the
					arrangement of a novel. Ladies seem to appropriate to themselves an exclusive
					privilege in this kind of writing; witness the numerous productions of romantic
					tales to which female authors have given birth. The portraiture of the tender
					passions, the delicacy of sentiment, and the easy flow of style, may, perhaps,
					be most adapted to the genius of the softer sex: but however that may be,
					politeness, certainly, will not suffer us to dispute this palm with our fair
					competitors. We, though of the harder sex, as men, and of a still harder <hi
						rendition="#italics">race as critics</hi>, are no enemies to an affecting
					well-told story: but as we are <hi rendition="#italics">known</hi> not to be
					very <hi rendition="#italics">easily pleased</hi>, it may be imagined that those
					performances only will obtain the sanction of our applause, which can stand the
					test of certain criteria of excellence.</p>
				<p> The story of a novel should be formed of a variety of interesting incidents; a
					knowlege of the world, and of mankind, are essential requisites in the writer;
					the characters should be always natural; the personages should talk, think, and
					act, as becomes their respective ages, situations, and characters; the
					sentiments should be moral, chaste, and delicate; the language should be easy,
					correct, and elegant, free from affectation, and unobscured by pedantry; and the
					narrative should be as little interrupted as possible by digressions and
					episodes of every kind: yet if an author chuses to indulge, occasionally, in
					moral reflections, in the view of blending instruction with amusement, we would
					not wish, altogether, to frustrate so good a design:&#8212;but, that his
					precepts may obtain the utmost efficacy, <pb n="401"/>we would recommend them to
					be inserted in those periods of the history, where the reader&apos;s curiosity
					can most patiently submit to suspense. </p>
				<p> Having thus given a sketch of what a novel should be to <hi rendition="#italics"
						>please us</hi>, we proceed to the work which has given occasion to these
					remarks.</p>
				<p> This novel, then, consists of a series of letters between the Hon. Mr. Wilton
					and his friend Mr. Benfield. Mr. Wilton is the son of Lord Wilton, a cruel,
					avaritious, despotic parent, who wishes to force his son into a marriage,
					(extremely against his inclinations,) with Miss Silvertop, a young lady of large
					fortune: the parties are introduced to each other, and are left alone for the
					purpose of <hi rendition="#italics">making love</hi>; when, unluckily, the
					gentleman begins by asking the young lady, <hi rendition="#italics">which are
						her favourites among the dramatic authors</hi>. Miss Silvertop, not having
					been instructed in her literary catechism, stares, and seems not to comprehend
					him. He is not, however, discouraged: but pursues his <hi rendition="#italics"
						>learned inquiries</hi>, till at last the young lady betrays such a total
						<hi rendition="#italics">want of erudition</hi>, that Mr. Wilton, completely
					disgusted, resolves, in defiance of all paternal injunctions, to decline the
					marriage. Lord Wilton is in great wrath, utters dreadful imprecations, and even
					curses his son, who runs out of the house, gets into a stage coach, and arrives
					at Morpeth in Northumberland; where he becomes enamoured of a beautiful young
					lady, named Olivia. Mr. Fennel, one of Olivia&apos;s lovers, is jealous of Mr.
					Wilton, and sends him a challenge; a duel ensues&#8212;Mr. W. disarms and wounds
					his antagonist; who is so enraged, that he <hi rendition="#italics">insists on
						being dead</hi>, that Mr. W. may be <hi rendition="#italics"
					>hanged:</hi>&#8212;the latter is therefore, with all due formality, ushered
					into a prison: but Mr. Fennel, having reported <hi rendition="#italics">falsely
						of himself that he was </hi><hi rendition="#smcaps">dead</hi>, and being <hi
						rendition="#italics">taken alive</hi>, Mr. Wilton is released from his
					confinement, and marries Olivia; who proves to be another Miss Silvertop. The
					old Lord, who had determined an alliance with the family of the Silvertops,
					recalls his curses, and changes them into blessings; and a happy union likewise
					takes place, with regard to an episodical pair, whose adventures serve to
					diversify the work:&#8212;which here naturally concludes.</p>
				<p> In regard to the general character of Mr. Thomson&apos;s performance, it
					certainly is not void of merit. The volumes abound with pious and moral
					reflections, not unworthy the pen of a clergyman: but we should have admired
					this piety and this morality still more, had the language (especially of the
					earlier letters,) been less verbose, and the style less stiffened with hard
					words. Terms of the same signification are frequently <pb n="402"/>coupled
						together<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">For instance, &apos;black
							criminality,&apos; pref. p. 7.; &apos;Wanton lasciviousness,&apos; ib.
							p.9.; &apos;mutual reciprocation,&apos; ib. p.16.; &apos;cautious
							timidity;&apos; p. 32.&#8212;Other expressions, which we have remarked,
							seem much too stiff and pedantic for the characters that use
							them,&#8212;as, &apos;Pray, Madam,&apos; answers Mr. Wilton to a
							question from his lady mother, &apos; what prompts the interrogation
							?&apos;&#8212;&apos; My dear Henry,&apos; says the countess, &apos;I am
							afraid the air of your native country, after so long an absence in the
							warmer climates of France and Italy, is not <hi rendition="#italics"
								>congenial</hi> to your health, as you seem to have <hi
								rendition="#italics">acquired</hi> a slight indisposition this
							morning,&apos; p. 33.; and the Hon. Mr. W. is, in like manner, accosted
							by his honourable sister, with &apos;Pray, Henry, if our native air be
							more <hi rendition="#italics">salubrious</hi> than that of the
							continent&apos;&#8212;p. 36. With equal solemnity does the young
							nobleman answer his Right Hon. father&apos;s haughty commands to marry
							the lady <hi rendition="#italics">not</hi> of his choice: &apos;The will
							hath a certain prerogative, in the exercise of which it admits of no
							compulsory methods to corrode its happiness. It thinks, it acts with <hi
								rendition="#italics"> spontaneity</hi>; and when opposed, suffers a
							diminution of its pleasure.&apos; p. 37 &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb /> We would just
								observe, also, that the hero of this piece is said to be the only
								son of the <hi rendition="#italics">Earl</hi> Wilton, and yet he is
								merely styled the <hi rendition="#italics">Hon. Mr.</hi> Wilton.
								Every Earl has a secondary title, which, by courtesy, is borne by
								his eldest son; and his daughters are addressed as <hi
									rendition="#italics">Lady Ann, Lady Mary,</hi> &amp;c. [<ref
									target="people.html#MoodyElizabeth">Moody</ref>&apos;s
								note].
						</note></hi>: a mode of writing rather suitable to an indenture than a book
					of entertainment; and peculiarly inconsistent with the natural case and freedom
					of the epistolary style.</p>
				<p> Notwithstanding the impropriety of the language of some parts of this work, for
					it is not uniformly thus censurable, the story has not failed to interest us in
					the perusal; and it would be great injustice to the sensible writer, if we did
					not speak of his performance as entitled to a considerable degree of distinction
					above the common crowed&#8212;the <hi rendition="#italics">canaille</hi> of
					modern romances and novels.</p>
				<p> The leading moral purpose of this work, is to expose the unreasonableness,
					absurdity, and tyranny, of parents who usurp an absolute authority over their
					children, in respect of their matrimonial engagements; forcing all natural
					affection, and every prospect of happiness from that source, to give way to the
					calls of avarice or ambition.&#8212;This is a beaten path, which has been
					trodden by almost every novellist and dramatic writier;&#8212;who, we are happy
					to think, have successively encountered a monster which is now seldom seen but
					in their performances.</p>
