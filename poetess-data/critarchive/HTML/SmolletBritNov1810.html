            of the most prolific as well as popular of our novel-writers, was born in the
            year 1721, at the farm of Dalquhurn on the banks of the Leven, amidst some of
            the most picturesque scenery of Scotland, to the beauties of which he afterwards
            paid an elegant poetical tribute.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> His father was the fourth son of <a href="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">Sir James Smollet</a>, of Bonhill:
            he married, without his father's consent, a lady of no fortune; and dying
            soon after the birth of his youngest son, his family, consisting of two sons and
            a daughter, were left entirely dependent on the bounty of their grandfather for
            a subsistence. The eldest, <a href="people.html#SmollettJames">James</a>,
            went into the army. His regiment was ordered abroad; and the transport in which
            he was, with part of the troops, was unfortunately lost off the coast of
            America. He is mentioned as a young man of great promise, and Dr. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> always preserved towards
            him an affectionate remembrance.

         <p><a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Tobias</a>, the subject of this
            memoir, was put to school at Dumbarton, where it is recorded that the first

            always a large share of that national spirit by which his countrymen are
            generally distinguished. Young <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Tobias</a>, however, was not always in the heroic mood. Many stories are
            told of his exploits; and many acts of boyish mischief and frolic, recorded in
            <span class="italics">Roderick Random</span>, are
            supposed to be supplied from the memory of his own early years. From Dumbarton
            he was removed to Glasgow, where he was apprenticed to a surgeon, <a href="people.html#GordonJohn">Mr. John Gordon</a>, and at the same time
            attended the University lectures of anatomy and medicine. At Glasgow he began to
            display that vein of humour, and propensity to satire, which afterwards so
            strongly distinguished him, at the expense of the circles to which he had
            access, and even ventured to aim the shafts of his ridicule against some of the
            graver sort, whose exterior of piety he represented, possibly with truth, as
            only worn in compliance with the costume of the country. This, as may be
            supposed, gave great offence.
         </p>
         <p>His <a href="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">grandfather</a> died while he
            was at Glasgow: and though he had maintained the family in a decent manner while
            he lived, and would probably have continued so to do, he made little or no
            provision for them at his death; and <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> on this event, his apprenticeship being finished, came up to
            London to seek his fortune. On this occasion he was in want of money and
            recommendations; his friends supplied him very sparingly with the former, but
            were uncommonly liberal, he used to observe, in the latter article. </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> He soon got a situation as surgeon's mate in a ship of the line, and
            acted as such in the unfortunate expedition to Carthagena which took place in
            the year 1741.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span>. Of this he
            published an account, joining with those who threw great blame on the commander.
            The scenes he was here witness to made the strongest impression on his mind, and
            he has given them with great strength of colouring in his <span class="italics">Roderick Random</span>. Whoever reads that
            book will not wonder that he was disgusted with the sea-service, which he soon
            quitted, though he was certain of promotion, and resided some time in Jamaica,
            where he married a lady of the name of <a href="people.html#SmollettAnneLassells">Lascelles</a>. He returned to
            London soon after the year 1745, and became writer by profession. 
         </p>
         <p>The talents of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> were
            vigorous, his powers of application strong, his execution rapid, and there were
            few departments of general literature in which at one time or other he did not
            engage. Poetry, history, novel-writing, travels, criticism, by turns employed
            his pen. At the age of eighteen he had written a play called <span class="italics">The Regicide</span>. The subject was the
            assassination of <a href="people.html#JamesIKingofScotland">James the First of Scotland</a>, the affecting story of which, as
            related by <a href="people.html#BuchananGeorge">Buchanan</a>, had deeply
            impressed his young mind. It was afterwards offered to the managers of the
            theatres, and, on their rejection, printed by subscription; a mode of publicity
            by which unsuccessful candidates have not unfrequently vindicated the sagacity
            of the managers. He does not seem to have studied euphony in the piece, if one
            may judge by the following speci-</p>

            which always made a part of his nature, poured itself out in complaints, which
            the good sense he possessed would have told him, in any case but his own, were
            little interesting to any but the disappointed author. 
         </p>
         <p>In poetry the talents of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>
            were more respectable; he is the author of several pretty and elegant pieces,
            some of which, as <span class="italics">The Ode to Leven
               Water</span>, <span class="italics">The Tears of
               Scotland</span>, <span class="italics">Verses to a young
               Lady playing</span>, are written with tenderness and delicacy;
            while the <span class="italics">Ode to Independence</span>
            exhibits a manly vigour of thought, perhaps more analogous to the general tone
            of his mind. His <span class="italics">Tears of Scotland</span>
            was inspired by a generous sentiment for his country on occasion of the
            severities exercised there after the rebellion of 1745. He felt strongly on the
            occasion; for, in aid of his patriotism, he was a Tory if not a Jacobite; and
            when he was advised not to give any more copies of his Ode, lest it might hurt
            his interest, his only reply was the adding the following animated stanza:

         <p>In 1748 <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> began his career
            of a novel-writer by publishing <span class="italics">The Life and
               Adventures of Roderick Random</span>, a work replete with humour
            and character, for a long time universally read by novel-readers, and still a
            favourite, as are all <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>'s, with those who can overlook their grossness, vulgarity,
            and licentious morals. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>
            seems to have taken <a href="people.html#LeSageAlain">Le Sage</a> in his
            <span class="italics">Gil Blas</span>, and <a href="people.html#Scarron">Scarron</a> in his <span class="italics">Roman Comique</span>, for his models. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Roderick Random</span>, like <span class="italics">Gil Blas</span>, has little or nothing of
            regular plot, and no interest is excited for the hero, whose name serves to
            string together a number of adventures. This work is in a great measure the
            history of the author's own life. The novel opens with the story of a young
            couple turned out of doors by their father on account of an imprudent match, and
            their consequent distress. It is natural and affecting. The cool selfish
            character of the parent, the scene of the female relations besieging his
            deathbed, the opening of the will, and the disappointment of the gaping cousins,
            are all admirably drawn, and probably contain much of the author's own
            story on the death of his <a href="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">grandfather</a>. The character of a British tar<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> is portrayed in that
            of Tom Bowling, uncle to the hero of the piece. It has been the original of most
            sailor characters which have been since exhibited. He is drawn brave, blunt,
            generous, enthusiastically fond of his profession, and with </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> a
            mixture of surliness in the expression of his kindest affections. There is an
            admirable stroke of nature in his behaviour, when, after attending the opening
            of the will, he walks away with his nephew, indignant that nothing had been left
            him. Full of vexation, he quickens his pace, and walks so fast that the poor lad
            cannot keep up with him; upon which he calls out to him with a cross tone,
            "What! must I bring-to every moment for you, you lazy dog?" his anger
            thus venting itself on the very person on whose account that anger was excited.
            Into this novel the author has introduced an account of the expedition to
            Carthagena, and has given a strong and disgusting picture of the manner of
            living on board a man of war. It must give pleasure to the reader of the present
            day to consider how much the attention to health, cleanliness, and
            accommodation, in respect to our navy, has increased since that account was
            written. Still, it is probable, nothing can present a more horrible sight than
            the deck of a man of war after a battle. Many of the characters in these volumes
            are said to be portraits. Strap the barber, schoolfellow and humble friend of
            Random, was one Hugh Hewson, whose death was lately announced in the papers.
            Captain Whiffle was a particular nobleman. Much of the work is filled up with
            low jokes, and laughable stories, such as, one may suppose, had been circulated
            in a club over a bottle. Some incidental particulars mark the state of
            accommodations at that time. Roderick Random comes to London with the <span class="italics">pack-horses</span>, there </p>

         </p>
         <p>Towards the hero of this tale the reader feels little interest; but after he has
            been led through a variety of adventures, in which he exhibits as little of the
            amiable qualities as of the more respectable ones, the author, according to the
            laudable custom of novel-writers, leaves him in possession of a beautiful wife
            and a good estate.
         </p>
         <p>In the summer of 1750 Dr. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>
            took a trip to Paris, and laid in a fund for a new display of character in his
            <span class="italics">Peregrine Pickle</span>. This is a
            work even more faulty than the former in its violation of decency and good
            morals. It has two or three characters of sailors not devoid of humour, though
            inferior to his first sketch of Tom Bowling. Commodore Trunnion is so rough and
            bearish, as scarcely to be like any thing human. He is the Caliban of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>. The wife is still more
            overcharged. Peregrine himself is a proud, disagreeable, ungrateful boy;
            vicious, as soon as he could know what vice was, and who had deserved to be
            hanged long before the end of the first volume. The most entertaining and
            original part of <span class="italics">Peregrine</span> is the
            account of a classical feast, supposed to have been held by a learned physician
            and other gentlemen, after the manner of the ancients. In this there is humour,
            and a display of learning, though in the former it is inferior to Scriblerus.<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span>
            Dr. <a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a> was meant to be marked
            out by the physician, and a painter whom he met at Paris furnished the character
            of Pallet.
         </p>
         <hr></hr>
         <p class="pageNumber">[Page viii]</p>
         <p>The author has in this work shown his predilection for the party of the <a href="people.html#CharlesEdwardPrince">Stuart</a>s, by introducing in a
            touching manner some Scottish gentlemen under exile for having engaged in the
            rebellion of 1745, whom Peregrine is supposed to meet at Boulogne, and who go
            every day to the sea-side to gaze with fond affection on the white cliffs of
            Britain, which they were never more to behold but at a distance. This Dr. <a href="people.html#MooreEdward">Moore</a> mentions as a real incident he
            was himself witness to, being with <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> at the time. Many strictures on the government and manners of
            France are introduced into this work; some of them just, but tinged with that
            prejudice against French manners which he had deeply imbibed, and which showed
            itself afterwards in his travels.
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">The Memoirs of a Lady of Pleasure</span>,
            <a href="people.html#VaneFrancesAnne">Lady Vane</a>, written by
            herself, are introduced into this work. They excited interest at the time, the
            lady being them much talked of, but can only now raise astonishment at the
            assurance which could give such a life without compunction.
         </p>
         <p> It is probable that <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> had
            been struck with the objections which must have been made to these two novels,
            that no poetical justice is exercised on the characters; for in his next piece,
            <span class="italics">Count Fathom</span>, he has
            exhibited, as the hero of his piece, a vicious character, who, after going
            through many scenes of triumphant villany, is detected and punished: but the
            narration is far from pleasing; knavery is not dignified enough to interest us
            by its fall. There are more serious characters in this piece, and he has </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ix]</p><p class="pnoindent"> attempted scenes of tenderness and exalted feeling, but with little
            success. Strong humour he possessed, but grace and delicacy were foreign to his
            pencil. He could not draw an interesting female character. But in his own way,
            the picture of Count Fathom's mother, the follower of a camp, is very
            striking. It is impossible to contemplate her going about, stripping the dying
            and the dead, with all the coolness of a mind long hardened by scenes of misery,
            without a thrill of horror. Count Fathom's adventure in the wood, where he
            is benighted, and narrowly escapes being murdered by ruffians, is exceedingly
            well told, and a man must have strong nerves to read it without shuddering.
            There is less of humour in this than in his two former works; but the story of
            the sharper, who introduces himself to a gaming-table as a boisterous, ignorant
            country squire, and takes in the knowing ones, is very amusing.

            himself as a stranger. She was a woman of strong sense, and a great share of

         </p>
         <p>On his return to London he engaged in <span class="italics">The
               Critical Review</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> the chief direction of which was in his hands for a number of
            years.—Reviewing is at best but an invidious office, and <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>'s temper was not
            formed to conciliate. It was the means of bringing him into continual quarrels.
            One of these was with Dr. <a href="people.html#GraingerJames">Grainger</a>, whose translation of <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Tibullus">Tibullus</a></span> he had reviewed with some acrimony.
         </p>
         <p> A little before this he had drawn upon himself a prosecution for an assault, in
            which he had caned a person who had injured him. This chastisement was magnified
            into an assassination. He was honourably acquitted; but he gave vent to his
            indignation in a very angry letter to the prosecutor's counsel.
         </p>
         <p> Another scrape he got into was on account of some strictures in the same Review
            on the conduct of <a href="people.html#KnowlesCharles">Admiral
               Knowles</a>, on occasion of a pamphlet published by him relative to a secret
            expedition which had failed. For this he was sentenced to a fine of a hundred
            pounds and three months imprisonment in the King's Bench. Dr. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> showed he had not
            forgotten this when he wrote his <span class="italics">History of
               England</span>, in which he mentions <a href="people.html#KnowlesCharles">Admiral Knowles</a> with great
            contempt.
         </p>
         <p> About this time he published another novel, <span class="italics">The
               Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves</span>. It is an imitation of <span class="italics">Don Quixote</span>, and is but a flat
            performance.

         <p> While <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> lay in the
            King's Bench, <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a>
            generously brought out a farce of his called <span class="italics">The
               Reprisals</span>, on which the author's former animosities
            against the manager were buried in oblivion; and he tells <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid"> Garrick</a> in a letter, that he hopes
            to have an opportunity of convincing him that his gratitude is at least as warm
            as any other of his passions.
         </p>
         <p> As <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> wrote neither for
            amusement nor for fame, but for subsistence, he soon engaged in another work,
            which, though hastily composed, had a large sale, namely, <span class="italics">A History of England</span>, in four volumes
            quarto. It was published in the year 1758, and is said to have been composed and
            finished for the press in fourteen months. Such facility of execution shows
            powers, but precludes excellence. The narrative is rapid and sprightly, and the
            characters are drawn with spirit; but it is a hasty work, and strongly tinctured
            with the political prejudices of the author. It was, however, acceptable to the
            public, and sold well, because we had at that time no history of credit which
            came down lower than the Revolution. A Continuation of it was published some
            years afterwards. In this history, under the head of Arts, he has taken occasion
            to mention with honour <a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a> and
            others whom he had satirized in <span class="italics">Peregrine
               Pickle</span>. A high eulogium is also paid to <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a>; and he handsomely told him,
            that he deemed it incumbent upon him to make a public atonement in a work of
            truth, for wrongs done him in a work of fiction.

            well-known <span class="italics">North Briton</span> of <a href="people.html#WilkesJohn">Wilkes</a>, and broke off the friendly
            intercourse which, as men of literature and genius, they had hitherto held with
            one another.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>'s temper was not well
            calculated for calmness in such altercations, and the virulence with which he
            wrote <span class="italics">The Adventures of an Atom</span>, a
            political satire describing public characters that figured upon the stage at the
            end of the last reign and beginning of the present, lost him many of his best
            friends.
         </p>
         <p> But his constitution now began to be much broken, and a heavy domestic
            affliction which fell upon him, the loss of an only daughter, led him to seek
            relief for himself and his <a href="people.html#SmollettAnneLassells">wife</a> in a foreign tour, of which he published an account under the
            title of <span class="italics">Letters from France and
               Italy</span>. They were entertaining, but full of spleen, and they
            betray those illiberal prejudices against foreigners and foreign manners of
            which he gave a specimen in <span class="italics">Peregrine
               Pickle</span>. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> never possessed the French language sufficiently to converse
            in it with freedom, and he probably thought he showed his own delicacy by
            finding fault with the the national usages. Yet whoever reads <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>'s works, even the
            least exceptional of them, will be of opinion that he had little title to be
            fastidious upon the score of delicacy. He was also disappointed in the Pantheon,
            which he calls <span class="italics">a huge cock-pit</span>, and was not
            enchanted with the Venus de Medicis. These animadversions drew upon him the

            "The learned Smelfungus," says he, "travelled from Boulogne to
            Paris, from Paris to Rome, and so on; but he set out with the spleen and
            jaundice, and every object he passed by was discoloured and distorted. He wrote
            an account of them, but it was nothing but an account of his miserable feelings.
            I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon; he was just coming out of
            it. 'It is nothing but a huge cockpit,' said he. 'I wish you had
            said nothing worse of the Venus de Medicis,' replied I. He has been flayed
            alive and bedeviled, and worse used than <a href="people.html#SaintBartholomew">St. Bartholomew</a>, at every stage
            he had come at. 'I'll tell it,' said Smelfungus, 'to the

            physician.'"<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> The last sentence suggests the best excuse for the
            author's misanthropy. However, the raillery of <a href="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</a> was too amusing to be
            forgotten, and gave a wound to the book from which it never recovered.

         <p>In 1766, he paid another visit to his native country; but his health was at this
            time so broken, that he was incapable of enjoying his tour. A fretfulness hung
            upon him the whole time, which, after his return, he himself noticed to his
            friends, with much sense of mortification at the peevishness which he could not
            conquer. He recovered, however, to a certain degree, and, in an interval of
            tolerable health, wrote the last of his novels, <span class="italics">Humphrey Clinker</span>. It was indeed the last of his

            circumstances could but ill support the expense of the voyage, his friends
            applied to the ministry to obtain the office of consul at Leghorn or Nice, by
            way of sinecure, that he might be free from all care but that of his health; but
            it could not be obtained: — a repulse not greatly to be wondered at,
            considering the part he had taken in politics. And indeed, what was there in any
            of his works to deserve from the public any other remuneration than what his
            bookseller afforded him? He went abroad, however, having probably obtained the
            desired assistance through the channel of private friendship, but died at
            Leghorn in the month of October 1771, in the fifty-first year of his age. His
            <a href="people.html#SmollettAnneLassells">wife</a>, who was with him,
            erected a plain monument to his memory on the spot, for which his friend Dr.

            inscription, highly complimentary to the deceased, and highly indignant against
            those who, he imagined, had not sufficiently patronized him. His cousin, <a href="people.html#SmollettJamesofBonhill">James Smollet</a> of Bonhill, erected a
            very elegant pillar to his memory on the banks of the Leven, the stream he had
            celebrated, and near which he was born, with an appropriate Latin inscription.
            It is one of the objects which attract the attention of the tourist in the

         <p>Dr. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> was in person stout
            and well-proportioned. His looks and manners had dignity, with a great mixture
            of reserve and haughtiness. He had a high independent spirit, and, it is said,
            would not stoop to flatter those who might have </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xv]</p><p class="pnoindent"> served him; but how
            far this was a matter of principle, and how far of temper, may be made a
            question. A memoir of this author by Dr. <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Moore</a>, his friend and countryman, is prefixed to an edition of his
            Works, from which the facts in this account are chiefly taken. He concludes his
            character in these words: "He was of an intrepid, independent, imprudent
            disposition, equally incapable of deceit and adulation, and more disposed to
            cultivate the acquaintance of those he could serve, than of those who could
            serve him."

         <p>As a novel-writer the characteristics of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> are strong masculine humour, a knowledge of the world,
            particularly of the vicious part of it, and great force in drawing his
            characters; but of grace and amenity he had no idea. Neither had he any finesse.
            He does not know how, like <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>, to insinuate an idea under the mask of a grave irony. He
            had largely conversed with the world, and travelled, so that his delineations of
            character and adventures are as different as possible from the effusions of the
            sentimental theorist. He had certainly vigour of genius, as well as rapidity of
            execution, but he had none of the finer feelings. To the tender and delicate
            sensibilities of love he seems to have been a stranger, and he fails whenever he
            attempts serious and interesting characters. He has little of plot, but deals
            much in stories of broad mirth, such as that of the man who got at all the
            secrets of the town by pretending deafness; and his works would afford much

            vicious manners which pervade them all.
         </p>
         <p>His mind, either from the vulgar scenes of his early life, or the society of the
            crew of a man-of-war, seems to have received an indelible taint of vice and
            impurity. Vice in his works cannot be said to be seductive; for an air of
            misanthropy pervades all his compositions, and he has scarcely in any of them
            given us one character to love. It has been said of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>, that he could not draw a
            thoroughly virtuous character; but <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> could not draw an amiable one. It must be remembered,
            however, that vice may pollute the mind, and coarseness vitiate the taste, even
            when presented in the least attractive form; and it is therefore to the praise
            of the present generation that this author's novels are much less read now
            than they were formerly. The least exceptionable of them is <span class="italics">Humphrey Clinker</span>, which, that a name
            of so much celebrity might not be entirely passed over, makes a part of this
            Selection. It was written at a time when the author's mind was mellowed by
            age, and cultured society had somewhat softened the coarseness of his painting
            without destroying his vein of humour. It is the only one of his productions in
            this line which has not a vicious tendency; but though the <span class="italics"> moral sense</span> is not offended in it, the same
            cannot be said of all the other senses. There is very little of plot in
            <span class="italics">Humphrey Clinker</span>. It is
            carried on in letters, and is rather a frame for remarks on Bath, London,
            &amp;c. than a regular story. There is a great </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xvii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> deal of humour,
            especially in the first volume: the latter part might be entitled with more
            propriety A Tour into Scotland, and not an unentertaining one, though the
            nationality of the author is very apparent. The character of Matthew Bramble,
            <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a> seems to intend for
            his own. He is represented as a humourist and a misanthrope, with good sense and
            a feeling heart under his rough husk. His letters are filled with the most
            caustic strictures upon every thing he sees and hears; the London markets, the
            rooms and company at Bath and Bristol, the accommodations in travelling; and, in
            short, every thing he meets with is disgusting till he comes to Scotland —
            when the scene is changed. He has introduced a whimsical character, Lismahago,
            into whose mouth he artfully puts an apology for his countrymen more partial
            than he would have chosen to take upon himself. The letters of Bramble are
            amusingly contrasted with those of his niece, who sees every thing with the
            youthful eyes of admiration, and is pleased and happy every where; by which
            means the author has in a sprightly manner exhibited both sides of the canvass.
            The reader is often put in mind of <span class="italics">The Bath
               Guide,</span><span class="sup"><a href="#11" id="back11"><sup>11</sup></a> </span> which has suggested
            several of his remarks and descriptions, and which may also be traced in the
            humour of the characters. The letters of Tabitha Bramble are very diverting.
            Winifred is another Slipslop; but her bad spelling grows rather tiresome towards
            the end. It must be observed that the style of the different personages, all ap-

            <span class="italics">Humphrey Clinker </span> is the
            only one of the author's pieces that has no sailor in it. It may perhaps be
            a greater curiosity for that reason, as the connoisseurs value a Wooverman
            without a horse.
