            					first English author who has given celebrity to the modern novel, was born in
            					the year 1689, at some place in Derbyshire, but in what particular town is not
            					known, as he, from some reason or other, always avoided mentioning the place
            of
            					his birth. This reserve could not well spring from a desire of concealing the
            					obscurity of his origin, since he has himself freely mentioned it in his letters
            					to his friends. His father was a joiner, ingenious in his profession, and
            					respectable in his character. He was in flourishing business in London, and much
            					noticed, says his son, by the <a href="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">duke
               						of Monmouth</a>, after whose defeat and death he thought it expedient to
            					retire into the country, which was the occasion of his settling in Derbyshire;
            					and there our author spent the early years of his life. He was at first intended
            					for the church, for which profession he was well suited by his seriousness and
            					love of letters; but his father having a numerous family, and being, besides,
            in
            					declining circumstances, was not able to allow him a liberal education. Though
            					he did not go to business till sixteen, </p>

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ii]</p><p class="pnoindent">it is probable he enjoyed very slender
            					advantages of school-learning. Some of his admirers have wished to raise his
            					character by affirming that he possessed a knowledge of the classics; but his
            					own assertions are frequent in his letters, that he was acquainted with no
            					language but his own, not even French. His deficiencies in this respect he often
            					lamented, and it is certain his style is as remote as possible from that of a
            					scholar. It abounds with colloquial vulgarisms, and has neither that precision
            					nor that tincture of classic elegance which is generally the result of an early
            					familiarity with the best models. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> was however always fond of reading, and still more of
            					narrating. Some anecdotes are preserved in his letters which show very strongly
            					the early bent of his genius. It appears that he was not fond of the usual
            					amusements of boys, but used very early to exercise his invention by gathering
            					his schoolfellows round him, and telling them affecting stories; and he then
            					wrote "A little history of a servant man who was preferred by a young lady
            					to a great lord who was a libertine."<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> All his stories, he tells us, had a good moral;
            					they were not stories of genii and fairies, but of life, and probably of low
            					life. It was indeed a peculiarity in him, that he was fond of two things which
            					boys in general have rather an aversion to; letter-writing, and the company of
            					the other sex. At the early age of thirteen he was a favourite with all the
            					girls in the neighbourhood who were fond of books. He used to read to them as
            					they sat at work with their needles; he also was </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">the confident of
            					their secrets, and wrote or corrected their love-letters for them. Even before
            					that age he had written an anonymous letter of grave advice to an elderly widow
            					lady. Who does not see that his most admired works are only the expansion of
            					those talents which in the germ prompted his earliest efforts? 
         </p>
         <p> Human nature is human nature in every class: the hopes and the fears, the
            					perplexities and the struggles, of these low-bred girls, in probably an obscure
            					village, supplied the future author with those ideas which, by their gradual
            					development, produced the characters of a <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a></span> or a <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a></span>.—In the mean time years went on; and it being
            					incumbent on him to fix on some business, as his father could not bring him up
            					to a profession, he chose that of a printer, chiefly, as he informs us, because
            					he thought it would gratify his thirst for reading; and he was bound apprentice
            					to <a href="people.html#WildeJohn">Mr. Wilde</a> of Stationers' Hall
            					in the year 1706. He did not however find it easy to gratify this thirst, though
            					the stream ran by his lips. He served a severe master, and was obliged, greatly
            					to the injury of his constitution, to steal his reading from the hours of rest
            					and relaxation; and so conscientious was he, that on these occasions he always,
            					as he informs us, purchased his own candle. He was at the same time so diligent
            					in his proper business that his master used to call him the pillar of his house.
            
         </p>
         <p> After the expiration of his apprenticeship, our author continued five or six
            					years working as a compositor and corrector of the press to a print-</p>

            					part of the time as an overseer; and, at length thus working his way upwards
            					into daylight, he took up his freedom, and set up for himself; at first in a
            					court in Fleet-street, from whence, as his business grew more extensive, he
            					removed into Salisbury-court. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> was not one of those
            					who make genius an excuse for idleness. He had been diligent and conscientious
            					as an apprentice, he was assiduous and liberal as a master. Besides the proper
            					work of a printer, he did a good deal of business for the booksellers, in
            					writing for them indexes, prefaces, and, as he styles them, honest dedications.
            					These humble employments tended to facilitate to him the use and management of
            					the pen. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</a>'s
            					punctuality, and the honour and generosity of his dealings, soon gained him
            					friends, and his business greatly flourished. He printed for a while <span class="italics">The True Briton</span>, a periodical
            					paper, published in 1723, under the auspices of the <a href="people.html#WhartonPhilip">Duke of Wharton</a>, who, at that time,
            					was endeavouring to foment a spirit of opposition in the city; and, to gain
            					popularity, became a member of the wax-chandlers' company. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>, though his
            					principles were very different, was intimate with him, as was also, in early
            					life, <a href="people.html#YoungEdward">Dr. Young</a>. Some of the numbers
            					of <span class="italics">The True Briton</span> were prosecuted; but <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. R.</a> escaped, as his name did
            					not appear. He was engaged some time in printing a newspaper, called <span class="italics">The Daily Journal</span>, and afterwards,
            						<span class="italics">The Daily Gazetteer</span>. Through
            					the interest of the speaker, <a href="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr.
               						Onslow</a>, he had the printing </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">of the Journals of the
            						House of Commons, in twenty-six volumes, folio. <a href="people.html#OnslowArthur">Mr. Onslow</a> had a great regard for
            					him, and often received him at his house in Ember-court. Polite regards are
            					sometimes more easily obtained than money from the court end of the town. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</a> did not find this
            					branch of his business the one which yielded him the quickest returns. He thus
            					writes to his friend <a href="people.html#HillAaron">Aaron Hill</a>:
            					"As to my silence, I have been at one time exceedingly busy in getting
            					ready some volumes of Journals, to entitle myself to a payment which yet I never
            					had, no, not to the value of a shilling, though the debt is upwards of three
            					thousand pounds, and though I have pressed for it, and been excessively pressed
            					for the want of it.''
         </p>
         <p> He was chosen master of his company, an office which, in the stationers'
            					company, is not only honourable but lucrative, in 1754; on which occasion one
            of
            					his friends tells him, that though he did not doubt his going very well through
            					every other part of the duty, he feared his habitual abstemiousness would allow
            					him to make but a very poor figure at the city feasts. His indulgencies were
            not
            					of the sensual kind—he had, according to the salutary custom of the London
            					citizens, a country residence; first at North-end, near Hammersmith, and
            					afterwards at Parson's-green, where he spent the time he could spare from
            					business, and seldom without visitors. He loved to encourage diligence and early
            					rising amongst his journeymen, and often hid a half-crown amongst the letters,
            					so that the first who came to work in a morning </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent">might find it. At
            					other times he brought, for the same purpose, fruit from his garden. 
         </p>
         <p> In addition to his other business, <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</a> purchased, in 1760, a moiety of the patent of law
            					printer to his majesty, which department of his business he carried on in
            					partnership with Miss <a href="people.html#LintotCatherine">Catherine
               						Lintot</a>. From all these sources he was enabled to make that comfortable
            					provision for a rising family, which patient industry, judiciously directed,
            					will, generally, in this country, enable a man to procure. 
         </p>
         <p> But the genius of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>
            					was not destined to be for ever employed in ushering into the world the
            					productions of others. His first work was his <span class="italics">Pamela</span>. It grew out of the following circumstance.
            					The booksellers, for whom it has been mentioned that he had occasionally
            					employed his pen, had desired him to give them a volume of familiar letters upon
            					various supposed occasions. He began;—but letter producing letter it grew
            					into a story, and was given to the public under the title of <span class="italics">The History of Pamela</span>. It appeared
            					first in two volumes; two more were added afterwards. The idea the author set
            					out with of writing letters for people of rather the lower class, probably
            					determined him to the station of his heroine and the simplicity of her language.
            
         </p>
         <p> The author's object in <span class="italics">Pamela</span>
            					is twofold: to reclaim a libertine by the influence of virtuous affection, and
            					to conduct virtue safe and triumphant through the severest trials, to an
            					honourable reward. For this purpose <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a>, a </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">young girl, born of poor but pious and worthy
            					parents, taken by a lady of fashion to wait upon her person, and brought up by
            					her with great tenderness and attention to her improvement, is, after the
            					lady's death, at which event the story opens, exposed to the solicitations
            					of her youthful master, the only son of her benefactress. The story is carried
            					on by letters, chiefly between <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> and her father and mother. Her youth and innocence render her,
            					for some time, unsuspecting of the passion she has inspired; and, when she can
            					no longer misunderstand the purposes of her master, she prepares to leave his
            					house; but he detains her under various pretences, and attempts liberties with
            					her person, which she resists with firmness, as well as his pecuniary offers;
            					though not disinclined to his person, and though she has no resource, on the
            					supposition of leaving him, but to return to hard country labour. Her behaviour
            					is all the while full of humility and respect to her master in every instance
            					consistent with the defence of her honour. Her master, who, though young, is
            a
            					practised libertine, finding her protected by the watchful advice of her
            					parents, and by the care of a virtuous house-keeper, who had belonged to his
            					mother, determines to convey her to a place where she shall be entirely in his
            					power. Under pretence, therefore, of sending her home to her parents, he has
            her
            					conveyed to another of his seats, where she is absolutely confined, under the
            					guardianship of an abandoned woman, whose office it has been to minister to his
            					pleasures. The poor <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> forms
            					many schemes to get away, and attempts, by means </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent">of a young
            					clergyman, to engage some of the families of the neighbourhood in her favour,
            					but without effect. She then endeavours to escape alone, and actually gets
            					through a barred window into the garden, from whence she hopes to escape into
            					the fields, though ignorant of any one who will receive her; but she falls, and
            					bruises herself in attempting to get over the high brick wall. Her sufferings
            in
            					this attempt are affectingly described. Finding all her schemes abortive, she
            is
            					greatly tempted to free herself from the danger of dishonour, by throwing
            					herself into the pond; but considerations of piety at length prevail, and she
            					determines to trust to Providence. Her master, after many ineffectual attempts
            					to vanquish her resistance, begins to relent, professes honourable love to her;
            					and, after a severe struggle between his passion and his pride of birth and
            					fortune, offers her his hand in marriage. <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> acknowledges her love for
            					him, and accepts (almost upon her knees, it must be allowed,) his proposal.
            					Difficulties remain to be got over with <a href="people.html#DaversLady">Lady Davers</a>, a proud and termagant woman of quality, sister to <a href="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</a>; but the sweetness and prudence of
            						<a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> overcome her dislike,
            					and the whole concludes with the perfect happiness of the wedded pair. 
         </p>
         <p> Such is the outline of this first work of our author, which was published in
            					1740. It was received with a burst of applause from all ranks of people. The
            					novelty of the plan, the strokes of nature and pathos with which the work
            					abounds, the simplicity of the language, the sentiments of piety and virtue that
            					are brought forward, took at once the taste of the public. </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ix]</p><p class="pnoindent">Numberless were the compliments <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr.
               						Richardson</a> received upon it as soon as he was known to be the author.
            					It was not only read by all who sought entertainment, but was considered as a
            					work of such excellent <span class="italics">moral</span> tendency that it
            					attracted the notice of grave divines, and was even recommended from the pulpit.
            					It is impossible to peruse without astonishment the high eulogiums that were
            					given to the work in this particular view. <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Mr. Pope</a> declared it would do more
            					good than many volumes of sermons. <a href="people.html#LucasRichard">Mr.
               						Lucas</a>, the esteemed author of <span class="italics">The
               							Search after Happiness</span>, a much graver character than <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a>, and not personally acquainted
            					with the author, calls it "the best book ever published, and calculated to
            					do most good." The compliments of the author's friends in their
            					letters were quite extravagant. It was immediately translated into French and
            					Dutch. 
         </p>
         <p> The fame of this once favourite work is now somewhat tarnished by time, as well
            					as eclipsed by the author's subsequent publications; but the enthusiasm
            					with which it was received, shows incontrovertibly, that a <span class="italics">novel</span> written on the side of virtue was considered
            					as a new experiment. 
         </p>
         <p> Appretiating it at this distance of time, we must acknowledge that the faults
            					are great, but the beauties are genuine. The character of <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a>, so long as her sole object
            					was to resist her master's attempts, is beautifully drawn, with many
            					affecting incidents, and little strokes of nature. Her innocent prattle to <a href="people.html#MrsJervis">Mrs. Jervis</a>, the rustic dress in which
            					she equips herself, </p>

            					she, "it only blistered my hand in two places;" the sudden spring she
            					gives on seeing her father, by which she overturns the card-table, and the
            					affecting account of her sufferings on attempting to make her escape, are all
            					worthy of a masterhand. There are not many under-characters in this work; the
            					most pleasing, and perhaps the best sustained, of the whole, are those of <a href="people.html#AndrewsGoodman">Goodman Andrews</a> and his wife, <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a>'s father and mother. It
            					would not be easy to find a prettier picture of low life, and of true English
            					low life, in its most respectable garb; made respectable by strict honesty,
            					humility, patience of labour, and domestic affection; the whole rendered saintly

            					his humble grief, are truly pathetic. The language of the good couple is simple,
            					without being vulgar. It is not the simplicity of Arcadian shepherds: it is such
            					as people in low life, with the delicacy of a virtuous mind, might fall into
            					without any other advantages than a Bible education. It is the simplicity of
            an
            					English cottage. 
         </p>
         <p> The character of <a href="people.html#MrB">Mr. B.</a> himself is drawn
            					with less address than that of any one in the piece; he is proud, stern,
            					selfish, forbidding, (selfish, that is to say, in his love, for he has </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xi]</p><p class="pnoindent">generosity enough in money matters,) and his ideas of the authority
            					of a husband are so high, that it is not easy to conceive of <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a>'s being rewarded by
            					marrying him, unless her regard for external circumstances was greater than the
            					author would wish to have supposed. The moral of this piece is more dubious
            					than, in his lifetime, the author's friends were willing to allow. So long
            					as <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> is solely occupied in
            					schemes to escape from her persecutor, her virtuous resistance obtains our
            					unqualified approbation; but from the moment she begins to entertain hopes of
            					marrying him, we admire her guarded prudence, rather than her purity of mind.
            					She has an end in view, an interested end; and we can only consider her as the
            					conscious possessor of a treasure, which she is wisely resolved not to part with
            					but for its just price. In real life we should perhaps consider <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> at this period as an
            					interested girl, and it is difficult to imagine how a young woman of so much
            					purity of mind should feel her affections engaged to a man during a series of
            					the grossest attempts upon her virtue, and who, moreover, used no gentle arts
            of
            					seduction, but sought to awe her as a master and intimidate her with sternness,
            					rather than to win upon her as a lover. 
         </p>
         <p> Indeed, the excessive humility and gratitude expressed by herself and her
            					parents on her exaltation, show a regard to rank and riches beyond the just
            					measure of an independent mind. The pious <a href="people.html#AndrewsGoodman">Goodman Andrews</a> should not have

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xiv]</p><p class="pnoindent">has our author founded a most pathetic tale, and raised a noble
            					temple to female virtue. The first volumes are somewhat tedious, from the
            					prolixity incident to letter-writing, and require a persevering reader to get
            					through them: but the circumstantial manner of writing which <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> practised, has the
            					advantage of making the reader thoroughly acquainted with those in whose fate
            he
            					is to be interested. In consequence of this, our feelings are not transient,
            					elicited here and there by a pathetic stroke; but we regard his characters as
            					real personages, whom we know and converse with, and whose fate remains to be
            					decided in the course of events. The characters, much more numerous than in <span class="italics">Pamela</span>, are all distinctly drawn
            					and well preserved, and there is a proper contrast and variety in the casting
            of
            					the parts. The plot, as we have seen, is simple, and no under-plots interfere
            					with the main design. No digressions, no episodes. It is wonderful that without
            					these helps of common writers, he could support a work of such length. With <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> it begins,—with
            						<a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> it ends. We do not
            					come upon unexpected adventures and wonderful recognitions, by quick turns and
            					surprises: we see her fate from afar, as it were through a long avenue, the
            					gradual approach to which, without ever losing sight of the object, has more
            of
            					simplicity and grandeur than the most cunning labyrinth that can be contrived
            by
            					art. In the approach to the modern country-seat, we are made to catch
            					transiently a side-view of it through an opening of the trees, or to burst upon
            					it from a </p>

            					filling his eye and his imagination with still increasing ideas of its
            					magnificence.—As the work advances, the character rises; the distress is
            					deepened; our hearts are torn with pity and indignation; bursts of grief succeed
            					one another, till at length the mind is composed and harmonized with emotions
            of
            					milder sorrow; we are calmed into resignation, elevated with pious hope, and
            					dismissed glowing with the conscious triumphs of virtue.

         <p> The first group which presents itself is that of the Harlowe family. They are

            					his friend <a href="people.html#Belford">Belford</a> is of <span class="italics">his</span> schemes and designs. The character of <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> herself is very highly
            					wrought: she has all the grace, and dignity, and delicacy, of a finished model
            					of female excellence. Her duty to her parents is implicit, except in the article
            					of sacrificing herself to a man utterly disgustful to her; and she bears with
            					the greatest meekness the ill usage she receives from the other branches of the
            					family. Duty, indeed, is the great principle of her conduct. Her affections are
            					always completely under command; and her going off with <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> appears a step she was
            					betrayed, not persuaded, into. His persuasions she had withstood; and it was
            					fear, not love, that at last precipitated her into his protection. If,
            					therefore, the author meant to represent her subsequent misfortunes as a
            					punishment, he has scarcely made her faulty enough. That a young lady has eloped
            					from her father's house with a libertine, sounds, indeed, like a grave
            					offence; but the fault, when it is examined into, is softened and shaded off
            by
            					such a variety of circumstances, that it becomes almost evanescent. Who that
            					reads the treatment she experienced, does not wonder at her long-suffering?
            					After <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> finds herself,
            					against her will and intention, in the power of her lover, the story becomes,
            					for a while, a game at chess, in which both parties exert great skill and
            					presence of mind, and quick observation of each other's motions. Not a
            					moment of weakness does <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a>
            					betray; and </p>

         <p> During this part of the story, the generality of readers are perhaps inclined to
            					wish that <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> should give up his
            					wicked intentions, reform, and make <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> happy in the marriage state. This was the conclusion which
            						<a href="people.html#BradshaighDorothy">Lady Bradshaigh</a> so
            					vehemently and passionately urged the author to adopt. But when the unfeeling
            					character of <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> proceeds to
            					deeper and darker wickedness; when his unrelenting cruelty meditates, and
            					actually perpetrates, the last unmanly outrage upon unprotected innocence and
            					virtue,—the heart surely cannot have right feelings that does not
            					cordially detest so black a villain, notwithstanding the agreeable qualities
            					which are thrown into his character; and that woman must have little delicacy,
            					who does not feel that his crime has raised an eternal wall of separation
            					between him and the victim of his treachery, whatever affection she might have
            					previously entertained for him. Yet it is said by some, that the author has made
            						<a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> too agreeable, and his
            					character has been much the object of criticism. But a little reflection will
            					show us, that the author had a more difficult part to manage, in drawing his
            					character, than that of any other in the work, and that he could not well have
            					made him different from what he is. If he had drawn a mean-spirited dark
            					villain, without any specious qualities, his <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> would have been
            					degraded. <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>, as he is to win the

            					hero of the piece, and no one in it must be permitted to outshine him. The
            					author, therefore, gives him wit and spirit, and courage, and generosity, and
            					manly genteel address, and also transient gleams of feeling, and transient
            					stings of remorse; so that we are often led to hope he may follow his better
            					angel, and give up his atrocious designs. This the author has done, and less
            he
            					could not do, for the man whom <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> was inclined to favour. Besides, if it was part of his
            					intention to warn young women against placing their affections upon libertines,
            					it was certainly only against the agreeable ones of that class that he had any
            					occasion to warn them. He tells us in one of his letters, that finding he had
            					made him too much a favourite, he had thrown in some darker shades to obviate
            					the objection; and surely the shades are dark enough. In one particular,
            					however, the author might perhaps have improved the moral effect of the work;
            he
            					might have given more of horror to the last scene of <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>'s life. When <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> and he were finally
            					separated, there was no occasion to keep measures with him; and why should <a href="people.html#Belton">Belton</a> die a death of so much horror, and
            						<a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> of calm composure and
            					self-possession? <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> dies in a
            					duel, admirably well described, in which he behaves with the cool intrepidity
            of
            					a gentleman and a man of spirit. <a href="people.html#ColonelMorden">Colonel
               						Morden</a> could not behave better. Some tender strokes are thrown in on
            					his parting with <a href="people.html#Belford">Belford</a>, and on other

            					desire of life; but <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a><span class="italics"> could</span> have drawn a scene
            					which would have made us turn with horror from the features of the gay, the
            					agreeable seducer, when changed into the agonizing countenance of the despairing
            					self-accuser. 
         </p>
         <p> But if the author might have improved in this respect the character of <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>, that of <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> comes up to all the
            					ideas we can form of female loveliness and dignified suffering. The first scenes
            					with her hard-hearted family show the severe struggles she had with herself,
            					before she could withdraw her obedience from her parents. The measure of that
            					obedience in <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>'s
            					mind was very high; and therefore <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> seems all along, rather to lament the cruelty, than to
            					resent the injustice, of imposing a husband upon her without her own consent.
            It
            					is easy to see she would have thought it her duty to comply, if he had not been
            					quite so disagreeable. The mother is a very mean character; she gives a tacit
            					permission to <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> to
            					correspond with <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> to prevent

            					example of such a choice, as she never fairly made the choice. On the contrary,
            					she is always ready, both before her elopement and after it, to resign the
            					moderate, the almost insensible predilection she feels for <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>, to the will of her parents, if
            					she might only be permitted to refuse the object of her aversion. Is she, then,
            					exhibited as a rare pattern of chastity? Surely this is an idea very degrading
            					to the sex. <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>, indeed, who has a
            					very bad opinion of women, and thinks that hardly any woman can resist him,

            						<a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> was tried, because the

            					situations in life, and friends jealous of their honour, and an education which

            					seducer, and the glory of conquest is what he principally aims at. Had such a
            					character been placed in France, and his gallantries directed to married women,

         <p> There is an improbability which the author could not well avoid, as it resulted

            					acquiescence of <a href="people.html#Belford">Belford</a> in a villainy
            					which he all along so strongly disapproves. It is true, as a man of honour, he
            					might think himself obliged not to betray his friend's secrets; but his
            					disapprobation would certainly have prevented his friend from communicating
            					those secrets. <a href="people.html#Belford">Belford</a> is, in fact,

            					carry on the story, and must not be made too strictly the object of criticism.
            A
            					novel-writer must violate probability somewhere, and a reader ought to make all
            					handsome and generous allowances for it. We should open a book as we enter into
            					a company, well persuaded that we must not expect perfection. In <a href="people.html#Belford">Belford</a>, too, we have a reformed
            					libertine, one whom the reader regards with esteem and affection. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> mentions in one of

         <p> "The character of <a href="people.html#Lothario">Lothario</a> seems
            					to have been expanded by <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> into that of <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a>; but he has excelled his original in the moral effect of the
            					fiction. <a href="people.html#Lothario">Lothario</a>, with gaiety which
            					cannot be hated, and bravery which cannot be despised, retains too much of the
            					spectator's kindness. It was in the power of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> alone, to teach us at
            					once esteem and detestation; to make virtuous resentment overpower all the
            					benevolence which wit, and elegance, and courage, naturally excite; and to lose
            					at last the hero in the villain." 
         </p>
         <p> The interest which <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> excited

            					as they can scarcely help learning, from some quarter or other, how it is to
            					end. But in this instance, the interval of several months, which was allowed
            to
            					pass between the publication of the first four volumes and the remaining four,
            					wound up its readers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm; and the pleadings of
            					the author's correspondents for a happy end were as warm and earnest as if
            					they had related to the fate of a real character. To have made a different
            					ending the author well knew would have spoiled his work, yet he could not but
            					have been secretly flattered with seeing the strong impression he had made.

         <p> The <a href="people.html#Prevostabbe">Abbé Prevost</a> gave a version
            					of <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> into French, but rather
            					an abridgement than a translation. It was afterwards rendered more faithfully
            by
            						<a href="people.html#LeTourneurP">Le Tourneur</a>. <a href="people.html#Prevostabbe">Prevost</a> says, and truly, that <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> required some softening to
            					adapt it to the more delicate taste of the French. It was also translated into
            					Dutch by <a href="people.html#StinstraJohannes">Mr. Stinstra</a>, and into

         <p> Our author was now at the zenith of his fame; but his fancy was not exhausted,

         <p> After <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</a> had

            					determined to give the world an example of <span class="italics">a perfect
               						man</span>. His laudable design was to unite everything that is graceful and

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxi]</p><p class="pnoindent">in the man of spirit and the fine gentleman, with every
            					moral virtue, and with the observance of the strict rules of
            					Christianity—an arduous undertaking! He was partly stimulated to this
            					design by the attacks of his female disciples, who, in answer to the reproaches
            					he made them of liking <a href="people.html#Lovelace">Lovelace</a> too
            					well, observed to him, that he had given them nobody else to like:—the
            					virtuous <a href="people.html#MrHickman">Hickman</a> was too tame and too
            					formal to do justice to his good principles; and, in short, that he had not
            					presented them with one male character on which the imagination might rest with
            					complacence. If he did not wish they should regard men of pleasure with too
            					favourable an eye, it was his duty to provide some one whom they might like upon
            					principle. Upon this idea he determined to give them <span class="italics">A Good Man</span>, the title by which he always speaks of
            					the work while he is writing it, though he afterwards changed it to that of <span class="italics">Sir Charles Grandison</span>. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</a> is a man of birth
            					and fortune, endowed with every personal advantage, and master of every
            					fashionable accomplishment. He is placed its a variety of situations, calculated
            					to draw forth the virtues and energies of his character, as a son, a brother,
            a
            					guardian, a friend, and a lover; and his conduct is everywhere exemplary. He
            is
            					a man of address, of knowledge of the world, and makes himself to be respected
            					in different countries, and by all sorts of people, bad as well as good. He is
            					generous without profusion; religious without superstition; complaisant without
            					weakness; firm in his purposes; rapid in the execution of them; jealous of his
            						</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxii]</p><p class="pnoindent">honour, yet always open to a generous reconciliation; feeling
            					(at least as the author would have us believe) the passions of human nature,
            yet
            					always possessing a perfect command over them. 
         </p>
         <p> The conduct of this piece differs from that of <span class="italics">Pamela</span> and <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> in this respect; that it does not depend
            					upon one great event, but is intended to open and display this character in a
            					variety of lights. The unity of the work, therefore, consists in the reference
            					which every person, and every incident, bears to him who is the hero of it. Of
            					him the author never loses sight after his first appearance, which he makes as
            					soon as the reader has been prepared by the play of some inferior characters,
            					(who, to use a military phrase, <span class="italics">keep the ground</span>
            					for him,) in a brilliant action, the rescuing the lady he is finally to marry,
            					from the hands of a lawless ravisher. 
         </p>
         <p> It was necessary for the execution of the plan, and it is so contrived in fact,
            					that this work should be diversified with a greater variety of characters than
            					his former ones. It has, particularly, many more of the pleasing cast. The
            					author shows in it, that he had improved in the knowledge of life and the
            					genteel world; and there are none of those warm descriptions in it which were
            					justly blamed in its two elder sisters. He has an <span class="italics">enlévement</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> an incident he seems to have been fond of, since it occurs in
            					all the three works; but the object is only marriage, and it is managed with
            					perfect decorum, at the same time that it presents a truly affecting scene. The
            					early part of the novel presents a rich display of incidents and personages.
            The
            					history of Sir Thomas and Lady Grandison is admirably executed, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxiii]</p><p class="pnoindent">and highly moral. The behaviour of <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</a> to his

            					character to the greatest advantage.—But the chief intrigue of the piece

            					become acquainted with <a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a>; so
            					that notwithstanding our admiration for the latter, and the strong feelings she
            					has called out, we all along consider the Italian family as intruders, and are
            					glad, upon the whole, when <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir

            					overturn her reason; and afterwards, on the recovery of her reason, after a
            					severe struggle, voluntarily sacrificing that very passion at the shrine of
            					religious principle. <a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a> is
            					indeed a heroine, and her conduct is truly noble, because, with her articles
            of
            					faith, the obstacle was, in reality, insurmountable to a well principled mind.
            					Her faith might be erroneous; but her conduct, grounded on that faith, was just
            					and rational. This sentiment is insisted on, because some good protestants have
            					called <a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a> a poor
            					narrow-minded bigot. A bigot she certainly was; but it had been strange if she
            					had not believed the religion in which she had been carefully educated, and she
            					only acted consistently with that belief. It were superfluous to any one who
            has
            					perused this work, to remark the masterly manner in which the madness of <a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a> is painted. <a href="people.html#WartonJoseph">Dr. Warton</a> speaks thus of it: </p>

            					much: <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</a>, as a
            					Christian, was not to fight a duel; yet he was to be recognised as the finished
            					gentleman, and could not be allowed to want that most essential part of the
            					character, the deportment of a man of honour, courage, and spirit. And in order
            					to exhibit his spirit and courage, it was necessary to bring them into action
            by
            					adventures and rencounters. His first appearance is in the rescue of <a href="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</a>; a meritorious action,
            					but one which must necessarily expose him to a challenge. How must the author
            					untie this knot? He makes him so very good a swordsman, that he is always
            					capable of disarming his adversary without endangering either of their lives.
            					But are a man's principles to depend on the science of his fencing-master?
            					Every one cannot have the skill of <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles</a>; every one cannot be the <span class="italics">best</span> swordsman; and the man whose study it is to avoid fighting, is

            					thus expressed:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <table>

            					Hargrave, he may be said to have really fought a duel; for, though he refuses
            					the challenge in words, he virtually accepts it, by going into the garden with
            					him, knowing his purpose. In like manner he with Greville retires to a private
            					spot, and there, on his adversary's drawing, which he might be sure he
            					would do, draws, disarms, and gives him his life. But Greville might not have
            					given him his, nor could every one turn a duel into such harmless play. Can,
            					then, a better expedient be suggested? If not, must we not fairly confess that,
            					in certain cases, the code of the gospel and the code of worldly honour are
            					irreconcileable, and that a man has only to make his choice which he will give

         <p> Another fault is, a certain stiffness which, it can hardly be denied, is spread
            					over this admirable character. This results partly from the author's style,

            					change his religion for a wife, and bind himself to live half the year out of

            					readily to his pen; but we do not find in his writings, either the ease and
            					elegance of good company, or the polished period of a finished author. They are
            					not only overloaded with a redundance of complimentary expression, which gives
            a
            					stiffness to the dialogue, particularly in his <span class="italics">Grandison</span>, where he has most attempted to give a
            					picture of genteel life, but they are blemished with little flippancies of

            					difficulty, drawing back its head, it gasps for breath, and erectly perched,

            					gets breath, with renewed rage, it beats and bruises again its pretty head and
            					sides, bites the wires, and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer; till,
            					at last, finding its efforts ineffectual, quite tired and breathless, it lays
            					itself down, and pants at the bottom of the cage, seeming to bemoan its cruel
            					fate and forfeited liberty.—And after a few days, its struggles to escape

            					of warehouses for his business in Salisbury-court, and he had a country house
            					first at North-End, and afterwards at Parson's Green. His manner of living
            					was hospitable, but he was chiefly fond of female society, and was generally

            					called, he had great facilities for that knowledge of the female heart which
            he
            					has so eminently shown in his works; but it cannot be denied that it had a
            					tendency to feed that self-importance which was perhaps his reigning foible.
            					Experiencing no contradiction, and seeing no equal, he was constantly fed with
            					adulation </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xlv]</p><p class="pnoindent">and even his correspondencies with his male friends, such
            					of them at least as have been preserved, (and he was remarkably fond of
            					epistolary correspondence,) turn almost entirely upon his own works, and are
            					full of such exaggerated compliments as must have appeared extraordinary, even
            					when compliments were more in fashion than they are at present. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> was twice married;
            					first to <a href="people.html#WildeJohn">his master</a>'s <a href="people.html#RichardsonMarthawife">daughter</a>, and afterwards to
            					the <a href="people.html#RichardsonElizabethwife">sister</a> of <a href="people.html#LeakeJames">Mr. Leake</a>, a bookseller at Bath. By
            					both he had a numerous offspring; but four daughters only, by the last, survived
            					him. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> had high
            					notions of parental authority, as he has shown in his works; and though, as a
            					good and moral man under the influence of real principle, he fulfilled every
            					essential relative duty, there was a certain formality and stiffness in the
            					family intercourse, more favourable to reverence than to affection. His natural
            					reservedness of manner he himself was sensible of, and lamented. It was probably
            					increased by the nervous disorders, from which he was a great sufferer, and
            					which were brought on by no intemperance, as he observes, but that of study.
            It
            					is indeed astonishing how a man, who had to raise his fortune by the slow
            					process of his own industry, to take care of an extensive business, and who had
            					a number of connections and relatives, to all of whom he was very kind, could
            					find time, in the breaks and pauses of his other avocations, to write nineteen
            					close-printed volumes, as he often mentions when his correspondents were urging
            					him to enter upon another work. Where there exists strong genius the bent of
            the
            					mind is imperious, and will be obey-</p>

            					under them, do not often shorten the life they overcloud. This author lived to
            					the age of seventy-two, when he was carried off by a stroke of apoplexy, July
            					the 4th, 1761. He was much lamented by his friends, all of whom had experienced
            					his hospitality and many more substantial benefactions, for he was uniformly
            					liberal and beneficent.—It is a truth which cannot be denied, that the
            					works of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> are not
            					found to be so attractive to the present generation as they were to the past;
            					the young and idle are deterred from reading him by his prolixity, and the
            					defects of his style are become more prominent from the greater attention which
            					has been paid to that part of composition by modern writers. His fame at present
            					stands higher abroad than it does at home. He is as highly valued by foreigners
            					as <a href="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</a> is by us; and
            					whatever be his defects, his intrinsic merit is too great not to place him above
            					the varying taste of the day. When a hundred novels that are now read are passed
            					away and forgotten, <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> will
