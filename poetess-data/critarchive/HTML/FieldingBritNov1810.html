            distinguished novel-writer in the walk of humour, was born in 1707, at
            Sharpham-park, near Glastonbury, in Somersetshire. His father, <a href="people.html#FieldingEdmund">Edmund Fielding</a>, was of a noble
            family; he had served under the <a href="people.html#MarlboroughJohnChurchill">Duke of Marlborough</a>, and
            arrived at the rank of lieutenant-general. His mother was daughter to <a href="people.html#GouldHenry">Sir Henry Gould</a>, one of the judges of
            the king's bench. Thus advantageously ushered into life, from the situation
            and connexions of both parents, our author had every reasonable prospect of
            rising in the world; and, with the parts which nature had given him, of filling
            a distinguished station in some one of the more honourable professions. <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Henry</a> was first put under the care
            of a domestic tutor, the Rev. Mr. Oliver,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> whose manners at least were not calculated to inspire him
            with much respect, if we are to believe the tradition, that he afterwards
            introduced him into his <span class="italics">Joseph
               Andrews</span> under the appellation of Parson Trulliber.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> From the care of this gentleman he
            was removed to Eton. In this distinguished seminary he became a good classical

            to be an uncommon proficient. He also formed there those acquaintances with
            young men of rank and fortune, which are generally considered as among the most
            advantageous circumstances attending a public school. He was early known to Mr.
            (afterwards Lord) <a href="people.html#LytteltonGeorge">Lyttleton</a>,
            <a href="people.html#PittWilliam">Mr. Pitt</a>, <a href="people.html#FoxHenry">Mr. Fox</a>, and other distinguished
            characters.
         </p>
         <p> As young <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> was intended for
            the law, he was sent, for the next stage of his education, to Leyden, which
            university was then in the zenith of its reputation. He studied under the
            celebrated <a href="people.html#VitriariusJohann">Vitriarius</a>, then
            professor of civil law, for two years, and distinguished himself as much by his
            application, as by the strength of his parts and his love for literature. At
            that interesting period of his education, his progress was cut short by
            pecuniary difficulties. His father had married a second time, and the pressure
            of an increasing family (no less than six sons being born to him in addition to
            four children of the first bed) rendered it impossible for the general to
            continue his eldest son’s remittances at the university. He was therefore
            obliged to return to England; and found himself at the age of twenty in the
            metropolis, pretty much his own master, and exposed to every allurement to
            pleasure and dissipation.
         </p>
         <p> There is scarcely any profession from which there are so many deserters as from
            the law. A sprightly young man, who has imbibed in his preliminary education a
            strong taste for the more elegant parts of literature, is very apt to disrelish

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> the dry and severe studies to which he is devoted; and the
            temptations to pleasure, to which by living so much at large he is peculiarly
            exposed, and which he has seldom the force to resist, sap the vigour of his
            mind, and induce him to turn away from a pursuit which requires the unbroken
            powers of the whole man. Young <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> was peculiarly susceptible of these impressions: still, had
            he continued where he had so well begun, at Leyden, in a comparatively sober
            town, among grave professors, and students occupied in preparing for their
            future destination, it is probably we might have possessed another eminent
            barrister or judge, and that we should not have had <span class="italics">Joseph Andrews</span> and <span class="italics">Tom Jones</span>.—Be that as it may,
            his coming to London at so critical a period was decisive of his character and
            fortunes. He had a good person, a quick relish of pleasure, a constitution
            remarkably strong, and a decided turn for social enjoyment; so that no doubt his
            disposition met half way the temptations his situation exposed him to. His
            allowance from his father was nominally two hundred a year; which, he was used
            to say, any body might pay that would. To supply the deficiencies of his income,
            and support a gay life in London, he began to write for the stage, and in the
            succeeding ten years produced three-and-twenty dramatic compositions, farces
            included, a number many times greater than <a href="people.html#CongreveWilliam">Congreve</a> had given to the public
            during the course of a long life. The greater part of these pieces met with but

            day. 
         </p>
         <p> It has been matter of surprise to those who contemplated <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> in the quality of a
            novelist, that an author, whose characteristics are genuine humour and
            delineation of character, should have succeeded so ill in comedy; for what is a
            comedy but a short story, or novel put into dialogue? and the more of dialogue
            there is in the novel, the more spirit it possesses; so that they seem to be
            very kindred modes of writing.
         </p>
         <p> But it must be considered, in the first place, that a dramatic writer, being
            confined by time and other circumstances belonging to representation on the
            stage, is obliged to concentrate his powers, and give the effect by a spirited
            outline, which the novel-writer has leisure to produce by the slow and patient
            touches of a more leisurely pencil. Comedy also requires much more delicate
            management. Coarse incidents and language may pass in relation, which would
            disgust upon the stage; where, every thing being in action, an indelicacy or
            awkwardness becomes much more prominent than when it meets the eye of the
            solitary reader in the pages of a book; and the least circumstance that provokes
            a laugh at the piece is sufficient to ruin it for ever. A quicker sense of
            propriety is exercised on the benches of a theatre than at the desk of the
            reader. In the drama, moreover, the <span class="italics">author</span> is not
            allowed to show himself; by which the wit of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> would lose much of its
            poignancy. He does not dramatize his novel so much as </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent"> many others
            have done. The <span class="italics">author's</span> learning, the <span class="italics">author's</span> wit appear continually, not only in
            his digressive chapters, but in the representations of the characters and secret
            views of his personages; and the humour is continually heightened by the
            contrast between the author's style and his views of things, and the
            characters he is holding up to ridicule. 
         </p>
         <p> But the want of merit in <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s comedies may be ascribed to other causes. They were his
            first productions; and, like most of the productions of youth, rather drawn from
            what he had read than what he had seen. He could not be supposed, at the age of
            twenty, to have attained that knowledge of life and character which he exhibited
            when, in a maturer age, he wrote his <span class="italics">Tom
               Jones</span>. The English stage has few models of elegant comedy,
            and he seems to have taken his from <a href="people.html#CongreveWilliam">Congreve</a> and <a href="people.html#WycherleyWilliam">Wycherley</a>, and to have imitated their loose and vicious morals
            without their humour and brilliancy. Most of his pieces also were written in the
            intervals of pleasures and dissipation, with great rapidity, and upon the spur
            of the occasion, that is, the occasion for a present supply of money. He himself
            entertained a pretty great contempt for the judgement of the town, and hardened
            himself against censure by despising his censurers. He has printed one of his
            farces "as it was damned at the theatre royal, Drury Lane."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> It is
            related that, when his last comedy <span class="italics">The Wedding
               Day</span> was in rehearsal, <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a>, who was to act a part in
            it, begged the author to strike out a scene in which he </p>

            hissed. <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> refused: "If
            there is a weak part, let them find it out," said he. The event was as <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a> had predicted: and when he
            retired into the Green-room, where the author was drinking champagne, "I
            told you," said he, "it would never do; they are hissing, and I shall
            not recover myself all the evening."—"Oh," said <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> with an oath, "they
            <span class="italics">have</span> found it, have they?"
         </p>
         <p> One of this author's pieces, <span class="italics">The Temple
               Beau</span>, exhibits, with some strokes of humour, a character
            afterwards drawn with such success by <a href="people.html#HoadlyDrBenjamin">Hoadley</a> in his <span class="italics">Suspicious
               Husband</span>. His <span class="italics">Tom
               Thumb</span> has been often acted, and given great diversion to the
            audience; but his <span class="italics">Miser</span>, a free
            translation from <a href="people.html#Moliere">Moliere</a>'s
            <span class="italics"> L'Avare</span>, is the only
            one of his pieces which at present maintains its ground at the theatre. Yet,
            though there is nothing in the humour of the character which does not seem very
            capable of being transferred, it by no means holds the same rank of the English
            stage which <span class="italics">L'Avare</span> does on
            the French.—It is worthy of remark, that the liberties taken with some
            political characters, in one or two of our author’s pieces, are said to have
            been the immediate occasion of passing the act for limiting the number of
            theatres, and subjecting dramatic compositions to the inspection of the lord
            chamberlain. A restraint perhaps necessary, and no doubt permanent.
         </p>
         <p> The farces of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> were
            generally the production of two or three mornings. When he had contracted for a
            play or farce, he has often been known to go home late from a tavern, and </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> send a scene or two the next morning written on the papers that
            had wrapped up his tobacco, of which he was immoderately fond. Notwithstanding
            the number of his pieces, they do not seem to have been very productive to him
            in a pecuniary light. For one, which was acted six nights, he received only
            sixty pounds.
         </p>
         <p> In the midst of this career of dissipation, <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> fell in love with and
            married <a href="people.html#CradockCharlotte">Miss Craddock</a> of
            Salisbury, a celebrated beauty with a fortune of 1500<span class="italics">l</span>. About the same time, by his mother's death, he succeeded to an
            estate of something more than two hundred a year. Upon these events he formed
            the wise resolution to retire with his wife, whom he passionately loved, into
            the country, and to forsake the gaieties and vices of a town life. He went
            accordingly to Stower in Dorsetshire, where his little estate lay. And here he
            might have purified his mind and corrected his taste. No longer obliged to write
            for a dinner, he might have felt only the gentle and salutary stimulus of
            bettering his fortune and increasing his enjoyments by the productions of his
            pen. But unfortunately he took it into his head to vie in expense with the
            country gentlemen his neighbours. The sound of a family estate has a wonderful
            effect upon some men. It was probably an idea of this kind, added to a
            thoughtlessness now become habitual, that made him launch out in the absurd
            manner he did. He had a carriage, a large establishment of servants in gaudy
            liveries; he gave dinners, kept hounds and horses, and found means, in less than
            three years, entirely to dis- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> sipate his little patrimony. Some
            of these follies he has pourtrayed, softened no doubt, in the character of Booth
            in his <span class="italics">Amelia</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> He was now again obliged to draw subsistence from his own resources; and it is
            some praise to the vigour of his mind, and shows it was able to recover its
            spring, that he formed the resolution of seriously applying to the law, his
            original destination. He was about thirty when he entered himself at the Temple,
            and it is agreed that his application was laudable. He was one of those
            characters to whom mental exertion is more easy than abstinence from pleasure;
            and the good foundation he had laid in early life enabled him to recover a great
            deal of his lost ground.
         </p>
         <p> After he was called to the bar, he attended the courts and went the circuits,
            but never had any great flow of business, though he is said to have acquired a
            very respectable share of legal knowledge, and even to have gone deep into some
            particular branches of it, as he left behind him two volumes folio upon crown
            law. The gout also, which he had by this time earned, began to make depredations
            upon his constitution. He was therefore obliged to recur again to his pen to
            supply the wants of a growing family; and essays, plays, and political pamphlets
            were the product of his leisure. He wrote in a periodical paper called
            <span class="italics">The Champion</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span><span class="italics">An Essay on Conversation</span>;
            <span class="italics">A Journey from this World to the
               next</span>; and many little pieces, now forgotten, to which the
            time and occasion gave temporary value, were also published by him.

            after met with a heavy affliction in the loss of his beloved wife, who had long
            been sinking under ill health. This stroke he felt with an acuteness of
            sensibility which perhaps would scarcely have been expected in a man of
            pleasure; his grief was so strong that his friends were even afraid his reason
            should give way under it. He afterwards, however, married a second time, and his
            wife survived him.<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> Attached to the principles of the Revolution, he published, during the rebellion
            of 1745, a periodical paper entitled <span class="italics">The True
               Patriot</span>, and another, <span class="italics">The

            services to government were rewarded with the appointment to the office of
            acting justice of the peace for Middlesex, a situation he was induced to accept
            from the failure of his hopes of rising in the more brilliant career of the bar.
            In this laborious and at that time not very respectable office, he was active
            and diligent; and he published several tracts with the laudable design of
            checking the vices of the populace. An active magistrate was extremely wanted at
            that time. Robberies were frequent, and atrocious murders had been committed
            with a barbarity not usual in this country. <span class="italics">A

            given of county workhouses, bore testimony to his zeal and diligence. He wrote a

         <p> It shows the vigour of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s mind, that notwithstanding these exertions, and the
            duties of an active and laborious profession, with an anxious mind and a broken
            constitution, he found leisure for his capital work, his <span class="italics">History of Tom Jones</span>. He was about
            four-and-forty when he wrote it; a period of life when judgement, invention, and
            observation go hand in hand, and man possesses all his powers together. After
            the publication of this celebrated novel, we may regard the author as in the
            meridian of his fame, and possessed, through his various labours, of the means
            of living with ease and comfort: but his constitution, naturally strong, and his
            frame, originally athletic, undermined by irregularity and broken by fatigue,
            were now sinking apace; notwithstanding which he published, four years
            afterwards, his <span class="italics">Amelia</span>, in which,
            though it possesses many beautiful strokes, and an interest derived from its
            including a part of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Mr.
               Fielding</a>'s own story, the humour is fainter, the characters less
            original; and, like the second rainbow, though the same colours are seen, they
            shine with fainter radiance. It has more of sentiment than humour, more of
            narrative than of scenes passing before the eye.

            twelvemonth.<span class="sup"><a href="#12" id="back12"><sup>12</sup></a> </span> But now his health became entirely broken

            was ordered to Lisbon, whither his wife accompanied him; but he lived only two
            months after he got there. The last gleams of his genius were displayed in a
            small piece entitled <span class="italics">A Journey to
               Lisbon</span>, in which there is more of peevishness than of humour.
            He died in 1754, in the forty-eighth year of his age. His second wife with four
            children survived him, and experienced the kindness of <a href="people.html#AllenRalph">Mr. Allen</a>, the Alworthy<span class="sup"><a href="#14" id="back14"><sup>14</sup></a> </span> of the
            author, in the liberal pecuniary assistance he afforded for their education.
            <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> was succeeded in his
            office by his half-brother, the well-known <a href="people.html#FieldingJohn">Sir John Fielding</a>, who had been long
            his assistant, and who afterwards distinguished himself so much by his activity
            at the head of the London police, though he had the misfortune to be blind from
            his birth. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Henry Fielding</a> was in his person
            tall, and of a robust make with an originally strong constitution, qualities
            which, perhaps for that reason, he seems fond of attributing to his heroes. He
            was social, hospitable, fond of pleasure, and apt to be impatient under
            disappointment or ill usage. Though he might not be a very faithful, he was a
            very affectionate husband, as well as a very fond father; all the sympathies of
            a feeling heart were alive in him. By seeing much of the vicious part of
            mankind, professionally in his latter years and by choice in his earlier, his
            mind received a taint which spread itself in his works, but was powerfully
            counteracted by the better sensibilities of his nature. Notwithstanding his
            irregularities, he was not without a sense of religion, and had collected

            first of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s novels in
            the order of publication, has been, and always must be, a most captivating
            performance to those who have a taste for genuine humour. There is little or
            nothing in it of story, compared with the elaborate plan of his subsequent work;
            nor so great a variety of characters: on which account the performance is
            inferior, but it possesses, in quite an equal degree, the comic spirit of the
            author. He professes to have written it in the manner of <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</a>; and accordingly the style,
            where the author himself speaks, is in a kind of mock heroic, particularly in
            the introductory flourishes, where he ushers in the incidents of a foot-race, or
            a boxing-match between two rustics, in the pompous and lofty phrase which might
            be used to describe one of <a href="people.html#Homer">Homer</a>'s
            battles. This manner he has preserved in his other novels: in all of them the

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xiv]</p><p class="pnoindent"> author:—each
            mode has its advantages, that of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> is perhaps the most difficult. The most striking figure in
            this piece is that of Parson Adams, an original and most diverting character, in
            which the lights and shades are so admirably blended, and estimable qualities so
            mixed with foibles and eccentricities, that we love and laugh at him at the same
            time. 
         </p>
         <p> Adams is a country curate of great learning and integrity, very benevolent, and
            of such simplicity of heart that, to use the author’s expression, "he never
            sees further into men than they choose to let him." In common with many
            deep scholars, he is subject to great absence of mind, which brings him into
            many ludicrous difficulties; and he has a tincture of harmless vanity which
            leads him sometimes to assume more self-importance than belongs to his humble
            station. 
         </p>
         <p> The author has shown great skill in making us laugh so heartily at a character,
            and yet keeping it above contempt. This could not have been done in the
            degrading scenes of low life to which he is exposed, if he had not, in addition
            to his higher qualities, given him great personal courage and an athletic
            constitution; so that in the scenes in which his poverty exposes him to insult,
            his Herculean strength and intrepidity make us feel that, though he may be
            played upon, he is not to be trampled on; and the reader is well pleased to see
            that he generally gets the better in the rough contests in which he is engaged.
            It has been sometimes objected to <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> that so good a man as Adams, a clergyman, and a scholar,
            should be held up to ridicule; but </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xv]</p><p class="pnoindent"> it should be considered that
            comic characters were what he sought, and what his genius led him to exhibit;
            that such mixed characters do exist, and that our feelings are properly excited
            in due proportion to the excellencies and eccentricities of this amusing
            personage. His learning redeems his ignorance of the world; his simplicity does
            not proceed from want of sense, but want of penetration, which arises in great
            measure from his candour and singleness of heart: his absence of mind harmonizes
            with his erudition. A man of his stamp is not unlikely to forget his horse at an
            inn, to wade through a brook instead of crossing a stile to find a dry path, and
            to leave the sermons behind him which he came to London to print. It is asserted
            in <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s Life by <a href="people.html#MurphyArthur">Murphy</a>, that a Mr. Young,<span class="sup"><a href="#15" id="back15"><sup>15</sup></a> </span>
            a man of great learning and a friend of the author's, was the original of
            this picture. This gentleman was a man of great benevolence, an excellent
            Grecian, and particularly fond of <a href="people.html#Aeschylus">Æschylus</a>, and very subject to fits of absence. It is related of
            him that, while he was chaplain to a regiment in Flanders, he took a solitary
            ramble one fine summer's evening, and, falling into a deep reverie, walked
            on till he came to the enemy's camp, where he was with difficulty brought
            to his recollection by the <span class="italics">Qui va là?</span><span class="sup"><a href="#16" id="back16"><sup>16</sup></a> </span> The officer on duty, seeing he had strayed thither in the simplicity of
            his heart, politely gave him leave to pursue his meditations back again. 
         </p>
         <p> Two other characters of clergymen appear in this work, those of Barnabas and
            Trulliber. Trulliber feeding his hogs and tyrannizing over his </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xvi]</p><p class="pnoindent">
            wife is a truly Dutch piece, and worthy the pencil of a <a href="people.html#Teniers">Teniers</a>. It is possible a Trulliber might
            be found in a remote part of the country when the author wrote, but it is to be
            presumed the race is now extinct. Barnabas is a character of hypocrisy and
            selfishness, of which the world will always afford specimens. Joseph and Fanny
            are sufficiently interesting: the latter is drawn with ease and simplicity.
            Joseph is a hero in virtue, more so perhaps than might naturally have been
            expected from the free pen of the author, who seems to have been induced to give
            him this purity of character from a whimsical competition with the author of
            <span class="italics">Pamela</span>, against which work
            there are many sly strokes of satire. It is certain, however, that <span class="italics">Joseph Andrews</span> is the most
            unexceptional in point of morals of any of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s novels. So far as a
            free exhibition of vicious characters may be objected to on the score of
            delicacy, perhaps it is not free from blame, but in this it is far less
            exceptionable than those of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>; and there is between them this essential difference, that in
            <span class="italics">Joseph Andrews</span> the interest
            is constantly and uniformly thrown on the side of virtue. When our affections
            are drawn forth, it is in favour of the innocent and the good; when we laugh, it
            is at folly, affectation, or absurdity; when we feel detestation, it is at
            hardness of heart, as in the behavior of the passengers in the stage-coach to
            the wounded Joseph; or it is at brutality, hypocrisy, and deceit; so that, if
            <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> had written only this
            work, there could have been no doubt of his being ranked among the friends of
            virtue. </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xvii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> In this panegyric must not however be included a very
            dull history of a Mr. Wilson, inserted apparently, as well as another story of
            Leonora, for the sake of filling up, though the work only consists of two
            volumes. The story has the worse effect, as, after having passed through every
            scene of vice and debauchery, Wilson is rewarded with a virtuous wife: and by
            way of connecting this episodical story with the body of the work, the author
            has made him the father of the virtuous and deserving Joseph. 
         </p>
         <p> A number of other characters are touched with great truth and spirit. Mrs.
            Slipslop has become proverbial for her phraseology, which has been imitated by
            several novel-writers. Lady Booby is the prototype of Lady Bellaston.<span class="sup"><a href="#17" id="back17"><sup>17</sup></a> </span> The discerning reader cannot
            overlook Peter Pounce the steward, nor the simplicity of Adams, who believes him
            in earnest when he pretends "not to be near so rich as people thought
            him," and the <span class="italics">naïveté</span> with which
            the latter tells him, "that he always said it was impossible he could have
            honestly massed so much, particularly as he inherited no fortune," with the
            consequent anger of Pounce, all which conveys a satire as just as it is lively.
            We are never better pleased than when, either in fiction or in real life, a
            proud man receives a stroke of unintentional satire from one who has too much
            simplicity to feel that he has given it. But to particularize the strokes of
            nature and humour in this novel would be almost to transcribe the work; suffice
            it to mention one or two.

            his impatience to have her made indissolubly his own; Adams rebukes him for his
            impetuosity, telling him that "the passions are to be greatly subdued if
            not totally eradicated, and that he ought not so to set his mind upon any person
            or thing in this world, as that he cannot resign it quietly and contentedly,
            when taken from him in any manner by divine Providence." At this moment
            somebody comes in and tells him that his youngest son is drowned; and when
            Joseph attempts to comfort him from some of the topics he had just insisted on,
            the good man rejects them in the bitterness of his heart, and cries out,
            "Child, child, do not attempt impossibilities, the loss of a child is one
            of those great trials in which our grief is allowed to be immoderate." Yet
            the exhortations of Adams are not common-place and hypocritical, like those of
            Barnabas when he prayed by Joseph; his inconsistency is only the weakness of
            human nature. The passage finely shows how difficult it is to put ourselves in
            the place of others. It was impossible for Adams, with all his benevolence, to
            enter into the impatient feelings of the young lovers. He was ready to serve,
            but he could not sympathize with them. A younger man would have sympathized,
            and, if he wanted benevolence, might not have served them.

            to the <span class="italics">Paysan Parvenu</span> of <a href="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</a> than to any work of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>'s.

         <p><span class="italics">Joseph Andrews</span> was followed by <span class="italics">Tom Jones</span>, a novel produced when the
            author was in the meridian of his faculties, and after he had joined to his
            natural talents experience of the world, mature judgement, and practice in the
            art of writing. From these advantages a finished work may be expected; and such,
            considered as a composition, <span class="italics">Tom
               Jones</span> undoubtedly is. There is perhaps no novel in the English
            language so artfully conducted, or so rich in humour and character. Nor is it
            without scenes that interest the heart. The story of the highwayman, the
            distress of Mrs. Miller and her daughter in the affair with Nightingale, and
            many little incidents relating to Jones in his childhood, are highly affecting,
            and calculated to awaken our best feelings. Touches of the pathetic thus
            starting out in a work of humour, do not lose, they rather </p>

            from the contrast of sensations, and have a greater air of nature from being
            mixed with adventures drawn from common life. The conduct of the piece is as
            masterly as the details are interesting. It contains a story involving a number
            of adventures, and a variety of characters, all of which are strictly connected
            with the main design, and tend to the development of the plot; which yet is so
            artfully concealed, that it may be doubted whether it was ever anticipated by
            the most practised and suspicious reader. The story contains all that we require
            in a regular epopea<span class="sup"><a href="#18" id="back18"><sup>18</sup></a> </span> or drama; strict
            unity of design, a change of fortune, a discovery, punishment and reward
            distributed according to poetical or rather moral justice. The clearing up the
            character of Jones to Alworthy, the discovery of his relationship to him, and
            his union with Sophia, are all brought about at the end of the piece, and all
            obscurities satisfactorily cleared up; so that the reader can never doubt, as in
            some novels he may, whether the work should have ended a volume before, or have
            been carried on a volume after, the author's conclusion. The peculiar
            beauty of the plot consists in this; that though the author's secret is
            impenetrable, the discovery is artfully prepared by a number of circumstances,
            not attended to at the time, and by obscure hints thrown out, which, when the
            reader looks back upon them, are found to agree exactly with the concealed
            event. Of this nature is the cool unabashed behaviour of Jenny, the supposed
            delinquent, when she acknow- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> ledges herself the mother of the
            child; the flitting appearance from time to time of the attorney Dowling; and
            especially the behavior of Mrs. Blifil to her son, which is wonderfully well
            managed in this respect. She appears at first to notice him only in compliance,
            and an ungracious compliance too, with her brother's request; yet many
            touches of the mother are recollected when the secret is known; and the more
            open affection she shows him afterwards, when a youth of eighteen, has a turn
            given it which effectually misleads the reader. If he is very sagacious, he may
            perhaps suspect some mystery from the frequent appearance of Dowling; but he has
            no clue to find out what the mystery is, nor can he anticipate the very moment
            of discovery. 
         </p>
         <p> But intricacy of plot, admirable as this is, is still of secondary merit
            compared with the exhibition of character, of which there is in this work a rich
            variety. Of the humorous ones Squire Western and his sister are the most
            prominent. They are admirably contrasted. He, rough, blunt, and boorish; a
            country squire of the last century; fond of his dogs and horses; a bitter
            Jacobite, as almost all the country squires at that time were; and from both
            causes averse to lords, and London, and every circumstance belonging to a court.
            She, a staunch whig, a politician in petticoats, valuing herself upon court
            breeding, finesse, and management, and not disposed, as <a href="people.html#YoungEdward">Young</a> says in one of his satires,
            "to take her tea without a stratagem."<span class="sup"><a href="#19" id="back19"><sup>19</sup></a> </span> Their opposite though both wrong modes of managing Sophia, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> their mutual quarrels, and the cordial contempt shown for female
            pretensions on the one side, and country ignorance on the other, are highly
            amusing. The character of Western is particularly well drawn: he is quite a
            worldly man, and strongly attached to money, notwithstanding an appearance of
            jollity and heartiness, which might seem to indicate a propensity to the social
            feelings. His extreme fondness for Jones, and his total blindness to the passion
            between him and his daughter, though he had thrown them continually in each
            other's way, are very natural, and what we see every day exemplified in
            real life, as well as the astonishment he expresses that a young lady of fortune
            should think of falling in love with a young fellow without any. Many parents
            seem by their conduct to think this as impossible as if the two parties were
            beings of a different species, and they deservedly suffer the consequences of
            their incautious folly. His fondness for Sophia too, like that of many parents,
            is very consistent with the most tyrannical behavior to her in points essential
            to her happiness. His leaving the pursuit of his daughter when he hears the cry
            of the hounds, in order to join a fox-chase, is very characteristic and
            diverting. 
         </p>
         <p> It must be admitted that the language and manners of Western have a coarseness
            which in the present day may be thought exaggerated; and it is to be hoped it
            would be difficult now to find a breed of country squires quite so unpolished.
            Perhaps the improvement may be partly owing to their not being so independent

            mansion is deserted during half the year for London or a watering-place. It is
            probable there are more of his majesty's subjects at this moment hunting

            scraps of wisdom; like him, he is cowardly, and puts his master in mind of
            bodily necessities. The author has taken occasion through this character to pay
            a delicate compliment to the acting of <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a> in the part of Hamlet. Jones himself, the hero of the piece,
            for whom, notwithstanding his faults, the reader cannot help being interested,
            is contrasted with Blifil, the legitimate son of his mother. The two youths are
            brought up together under the same roof and the same </p>

            Jones is a youth of true feeling, honour, and generosity; open and affectionate
            in his disposition, but very accessible to the temptations of pleasure. Blifil,
            with great apparent sobriety and decorum of manners, is a mean selfish
            hypocrite, possessing a mind of thorough baseness and depravity. In characters
            so contrasted, it is not doubtful to which of them the reader will, or ought to
            give the preference. To the faults of Blifil the reader has no inclination to be
            partial. They revolt the mind, particularly the minds of youth. The case is not
            the same with those more pardonable deviations from morals which are incident to
            youths of a warm temperament and an impressible heart: these are contagious in
            their very nature, and therefore the objections which have been made to the
            moral tendency of this novel are no doubt in some measure just. It is said to
            have been forbidden in France on its first publication. The faults of Jones are
            less than those of almost every other person who is brought upon the stage; yet
            they are of more dangerous example, because they are mixed with so many
            qualities which excite our affections. Still, his character is of a totally
            different stamp from the heroes of <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>'s novels. He has an excellent heart and a refined
            sensibility, though he has also passions of a lower order. In every instance
            where he transgresses the rules of virtue, he is the seduced, and not the
            seducer; his youth, his constitution, his unprotected situation after he left
            Alworthy's, palliate his faults, and in honourable love he is tender and
            constant. His refusal </p>

         </p>
         <p> The character of Sophia was probably formed according to the author's ideas
            of female perfection: she is very beautiful, very sweet-tempered, very fond and
            constant to her lover; but her behaviour will scarcely satisfy one who has
            conceived high ideas of the delicacy of the female character. A young woman just
            come from reading <span class="italics">Clarissa</span><span class="sup"><a href="#22" id="back22"><sup>22</sup></a> </span>must be strangely shocked at seeing the
            heroine of the tale riding about the country on post-horses after her lover; and
            the incidents at Upton are highly indelicate. It is observable that <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> uniformly keeps down the
            characters of his women, as much as <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> elevates his. A yielding easiness of disposition is what
            he seems to lay the greatest stress upon. Alworthy is made to tell Sophia, that
            what had chiefly charmed him in her behaviour was the great deference he had
            observed in her for the opinions of men. Yet Sophia, methinks, had not been
            extraordinarily well situated for imbibing such reverence. Any portion of
            learning in women is constantly united in this author with something
            disagreeable. It is given to Jenny, the supposed mother of Jones. It is given in
            a higher degree to that very disgusting character Mrs. Bennet in <span class="italics">Amelia</span>; Mrs. Western, too, is a woman
            of reading. A man of licentious manners, and such was <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>, seldom respects the sex.

            a town-bred lady of fashion, who has laid aside her virtue. The scene where
            Jones meets Sophia at her house unexpectedly, the confusion of the lovers, and
            the civil, sly teasings of Lady Bellaston, are very diverting. Mrs. Miller is a
            specimen of a natural character given without any exaggeration. She is
            warm-hearted, overflowing with gratitude, sanguine, and very loquacious. The
            behavior of Jones in the affair between Nightingale and her daughter does him
            honour, and he manages the uncle and the father with much finesse. All the
            characters concerned are well drawn. The family of Black George exhibits natural
            but coarse painting; they would not be undeserving of a place in <a href="people.html#CrabbeGeorge">Mr. Crabb</a>'s parish register.
            The character of Alworthy is not a shining one; he is imposed upon by every
            body: this may be consistent with goodness, but it is not consistent with that
            dignity in which an eminently virtuous character, meant to be exhibited as a
            pattern of excellence, ought to appear. But <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> could not draw such a
            character. Traits of humanity and kindness he is able to give in all their
            beauty; but a religious and strictly moral character was probably connected in
            his mind with a want of sagacity, which those who have been conversant with the
            vicious part of the world are very apt to imagine must be the consequence of
            keeping aloof from it. Besides, it was necessary for the plot that Alworthy
            should be imposed upon. The character of Alworthy, </p>

         <p> The discovery of Jones's birth, and his restoration to the favour of
            Alworthy, wind up the whole, and give an animation to the concluding part, which
            is apt to become flat in the works of common authors. It is some drawback,
            however, upon the satisfaction of the reader, that poetic justice cannot be done
            without giving the good Alworthy the pain of being acquainted with the shame of
            his sister. It is not natural, when he does know it, that he should needlessly
            publish a circumstance of that kind, or consider Jones as having the same claims
            upon him as a legitimate child of his sister's; yet this is what he is made
            to do.

         <p> Upon the whole, <span class="italics">Tom Jones</span> is
            certainly for humour, wit, character, and plot, one of the most entertaining and
            perfect novels we possess. With regard to its moral tendency we must content
            ourselves with more qualified praise. A young man may imbibe from it sentiments
            of humanity, generosity, and all the more amiable virtues; a detestation of
            meanness, hypocrisy, and treachery: but he is not likely to gain from it
            firmness to resist temptation, or to have his ideas of moral purity heightened
            or refined by the perusal. More men would be apt to imitate Jones than would

            greater refinement also and delicacy of the present age, a sure test of national

            proscribed much of that broad humour which appears in the works of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s times, and we
            should scarcely bear, in a new novel, the indelicate pictures which are
            occasionally presented to the imagination. The scenes at inns also are coarse,
            and too often repeated. The introductory chapters ought not to be passed over;
            they have much wit and grave <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantic</a>
            humour, and occasionally display the author's familiarity with the
            classics. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s vein was not yet
            exhausted; he produced a third novel called <span class="italics">Amelia</span> . If this has less of the author's
            characteristic humour, it has more scenes of domestic tenderness. Contrary to
            the usual practice of novel-writers, the story begins after the marriage of the
            principal personages. The hero, Mr. Booth, is introduced to us in a prison; the
            distresses of the piece arise from the vicious indulgencies of the husband,
            combined with unfortunate circumstances; and in the character of Booth, <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> is generally supposed to
            have delineated his own. Amelia is such a wife as most men of that stamp would
            deem the model of female perfection, such a one as a man, conscious of a good
            many frailties and vices, usually wishes for. Faithful, fond, and indulgent, the
            prospect of immediate ruin cannot draw from her one murmur against her husband,
            and she willingly sacrifices to him her jewels and every article in her
            possession. </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxix]</p><p class="pnoindent"> Booth is represented as good-natured, thoughtless,
            and extravagant; passionately fond of his wife, notwithstanding occasional
            breaches of fidelity to her; and very ready to receive the sacrifices she makes,
            even to the pawning of her clothes and moveables, for the discharge of his
            gaming debts. Amelia, indeed, is a heroine of affection and obedience, and the
            impression upon the reader is certainly that of her being a very amiable and
            interesting woman; but her character exhibits a great degree of weakness,
            particularly in her behavior to the nobleman who is endeavouring to seduce her.
            What woman of any sense could suppose, that a gay nobleman would frequent her
            house for the sake of amusing himself with her little ones? Her softness and
            tenderness form a happy contrast with the boldness and daring guilt of Miss
            Matthews, a character conceived with great strength and spirit. She is a woman
            handsome and genteelly educated, but leading a life of profligacy, given up to
            her passions, dangerous; not frail only but wicked. She keeps Booth in unwilling
            bondage by her threats of disclosing his infidelity to his wife. The history she
            is made to give of herself is, however, a very dull one.

         <p> The prison scenes are strongly drawn. <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> was well acquainted with rogues and rascals in his judicial,
            and probably not unfrequently in his private capacity. There is much merit in
            the delineation of Captain James and his wife, a fashionable couple who are very
            complaisant without caring for each other. It is an excellent stroke in the

            something very touching in the humble love of Atkins, which is only revealed
            when he thinks himself on his death-bed; but the author has not used him very
            kindly in matching him with so disagreeable a personage as Mrs. Bennet, whose
            character throughout is thoroughly disgusting, and seems introduced purely to
            show the author's dislike to learned women. Learning in women may be
            inimical to some parts of the feminine character, but certainly does not lead to
            the vices he has given Mrs. Bennet. Probably the coterie of literary and
            accomplished ladies that generally assembled at his rival's house had its
            share in fostering this aversion. 
         </p>
         <p> Another character in this work is Colonel Bath, who hides great tenderness of
            heart under an appearance of fierceness and bluster. He warms his sister's
            gruel, and is ready to run any man through the body who catches him at the
            employment. His portrait approaches the caricature. 
         </p>
         <p> A more important personage in the story is the good Dr. Harris; a clergyman,
            active, friendly and benevolent, with a dash of the humourist. By his means the
            discovery is brought about that Amelia is entitled to a large estate, which
            extricates Booth from his difficulties, and brings the story to a happy
            conclusion. Though <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> in his
            former works has introduced </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> many clergymen who are held up to
            ridicule, it is not as clerical but as individual characters, for he was no
            enemy either to the church or to religion. We certainly cannot conceive of him
            as a religious man; but he was not from system irreligious. In his characters of
            Thwackum and Square he has given pretty equal measure to the divine and the
            philosopher.—There are many good moral maxims in <span class="italics">Amelia</span>, and much of grave
            dissertation, but less of humour than in the author’s former works. There are
            also many tender touches of conjugal affection and domestic feeling. There is no
            great merit, it is true, on Booth's side in receiving graciously the
            endearments of a beautiful woman who is always in good humour with him, even
            when he is most faulty. He is pleased with her; he could not well be otherwise;
            but he denies himself nothing for her sake or his children's. Yet, faulty
            as he is, the reader is glad when he is extricated from his distresses. That
            this should be done by the discovery of a forged will, betrays some poverty of
            invention, as nearly the same incident is made use of in the <span class="italics">denouement</span> of <span class="italics">Tom
               Jones</span>. 
         </p>
         <p> Upon the whole, though <span class="italics">Amelia</span> must
            be acknowledged inferior to the author's other two works, it would
            establish the reputation of a common writer; and the three together present an
            exhibition of wit, humour, and character, not easy to be paralleled before or
            since the time when they were published. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>'s works are not
            greatly relished by foreigners; his personages are so truly and
            characteristically English, that it requires the know- </p>

            early associations of a native fully to comprehend them. A Somersetshire esquire
            is a being as unknown to a Frenchman as a Limosin gentleman is to us. Humour,
            like some fruits of delicate taste, should be enjoyed on the spot where it is
            produced. It loses its flavour by being carried abroad. Indeed a foreigner often
            forms wrong ideas of the manners of a country when he takes them from works of
            wit and humour, where peculiarities are necessarily dwelt upon and exaggerated;
            and an Englishman, solicitous for the honour of his country, would not wish that
            the ideas of its manners should be taken from the works of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>. To himself they are
            valuable in the same light as the paintings of <a href="people.html#HogarthWilliam">Hogarth</a>, which are become curious
            from exhibiting the modes and dresses of the last century, along with the
            characteristic manners of the country, and the varied play of those passions and
            feelings, to delineate which, with spirit and effect, belongs to the observer of
            human nature in general.
