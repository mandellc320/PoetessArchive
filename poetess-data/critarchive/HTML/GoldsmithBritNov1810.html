            novels of a modern cast is <span class="italics">The Vicar of
               Wakefield</span>. Its author, <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Oliver Goldsmith</a></span>, was
            born in the year 1731, at Pallas in the county of Longford in Ireland, according
            to his epitaph in Westminster Abbey; but another account mentions Elphin as his
            birth-place. His character was eccentric; his pursuits were desultory. His
            father, who was a clergyman, gave him a classical education, and sent him from
            school to Dublin college. Like <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, he is said to have exhibited no peculiar marks of quickness in
            this period of his life, and he did not take his bachelor's degree till two
            years after the usual time.
         </p>
         <p>As he was intended for the study of physic, he removed to the university of
            Edinburgh in 1751, where he staid three years; but he seems not to have brought
            with him to this seminary much steadiness of application or ardour for
            professional studies, and he was obliged to quit it clandestinely on account of
            a debt he had contracted;â€”it is said, for a fellow-student, but probably
            the consequence of that mutual accommodation which often subsists between young

            was released through the friendship of two fellow-students. The world was now
            all before him,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> and he therefore resolved to see it, and accordingly
            embarked immediately for Holland; and poor as he was, and struggling with
            difficulties of every kind, performed a tour, mostly on foot, through that
            country, Flanders, and part of Germany. He passed some time at the universities
            of Paris and Louvain, and took a bachelor's degree of physic at the latter
            of these seminaries. He thence accompanied an English gentlemen to Geneva and
            was there recommended as a travelling tutor to a man of fortune.
         </p>
         <p>An eccentric genius is but ill calculated for a guide: our author scarcely
            possessed one qualification for the office, natural taste excepted; and probably
            the youth, who had just succeeded to a large fortune, was as impatient of being
            guided, as his tutor was unused to guide. Be that as it may, their connexion was
            soon dissolved by a disagreement, and poor <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> was left alone in the
            south of France, friendless and destitute in a foreign country, to find his way
            home, or pursue his tour as he could. Uncomfortable as many circumstances in
            this excursion must have been, it was here that the young poet laid in those
            images which afterwards produced his beautiful poem of <span class="italics">The Traveller</span>, great part of which was
            written in the countries which he describes; and, though no doubt a melancholy
            thought would sometimes intrude, as he found himself, </p>

            of travelling was incontestably more favourable to reflection, and gave more
            opportunity to the ideas to sink leisurely into his mind, than if he had been
            borne along through half Europe by the rattling wheels of a postchaise. 
         </p>
         <p>As a literary man, he was received by the convents with that hospitality which
            they so laudably practised; and he tells his readers no more than the literal
            truth, when, in his <span class="italics">Traveller</span>, he
            represents himself as leading "with tuneless pipe the sportive
            choir"<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> of the French peasants; for to the little
            knowledge which he had of the German flute he was often obliged for a lodging
            and a dinner.
         </p>
         <p>When <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> returned to
            England, a few pence in his pocket were the whole of his finances; he knew no
            one, and had no recommendations; and in this manner was he launched upon the
            great metropolis, with his pressing wants, and only his talents to provide for
            them. Without introduction, and of no promising appearance as to externals, he
            offered himself as journeyman to several apothecaries without success, and was
            at length obliged to accept of employment in the laboratory of a chemist near
            Fish-Street-Hill. 
         </p>
         <p>It was not long before he found out one of his old college friends, the same who
            had assisted in liberating him from the arrest, who, though he with difficulty
            recognised him through the forlorn appearance he made, generously shared his
            purse with him while he staid in London.

         <p><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> did not remain long in
            a situation so little adapted to his education and talents: he was recommended
            by the chemist as assistant to <a href="people.html#MilnerJohn">Dr.
               Milner</a>, who kept an academy at Peckham. The office of usher in a
            school has been the resource, at one time or other of their lives, of a great
            portion of men eminent for literature; but it cannot be said that their
            gratitude has led them to any partiality for that mode of life; as, on the
            contrary, they have generally taken care to show the disgust they had conceived
            against the employment, by painting in pretty strong colours, as <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> has done in his
            <span class="italics">Vicar of Wakefield</span>, the
            disagreeable circumstances attending it. 
         </p>
         <p>He soon quitted this situation; and having become acquainted with the
            booksellers, and being employed by them, he took lodgings in London, and became
            author by profession. He was at first employed in the <a href="people.html#ReviewMonthly"><span class="italics">Monthly
                  Review</span></a>, and in a set of essays for a newspaper,
            which were afterwards collected in his works under the title of <span class="italics">The Citizen of the World</span>. He also
            published a weekly paper called <span class="italics">The
               Bee</span>, and other pieces. But he was still amongst the drudges of
            literature, working in obscurity, and his name was unknown to the public, till
            he suddenly emerged into light by the publication of his <span class="italics">Traveller</span>, in 1765, which at once
            lifted him to an eminent station amongst the English poets. Both the character
            and scenery of different countries are touched in this poem with a rapid but
            masterly hand. Those of Holland and Switzerland are particularly striking. The
            moral and </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">political reflections that are introduced seem rather
            suggested by the necessity of finding a cement to bind the separate parts
            together, than by any spirit of philosophical research. The charming
            descriptions dwell upon the mind, but the moral is forgotten; or, if remembered,
            it is only to awaken the mind to the fallacy of the maxim, that <span class="italics">every form of civil society is equal in its influence
               on human happiness</span>.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> at this period seems to
            have had thoughts of practising as a physician. He dressed in the professional
            costume then in use, assumed airs of dignity, and left off those places of
            vulgar resort where he used to laugh and amuse himself. He went on, however,
            with his literary schemes; and in the next year <span class="italics">The Vicar of Wakefield</span> made its appearance. This
            delightful little novel had indeed been written some time before, and by the
            intervention of <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a> sold
            for sixty pounds, which went to discharge the author's rent. But
            booksellers are not always judges of their own goods, and the manuscript was
            kept back through diffidence of its success, till the author had acquired a name
            by his poem. Thus he had the ill-luck to dispose of both works as the first
            productions of an unknown author.
         </p>
         <p>His fame as a writer was now established, and from this time he was employed in a
            variety of works, from which he drew a very comfortable subsistence. The
            furniture of his mind was various, but his knowledge was superficial. Taste
            supplied in him the deficiencies of science: his style was easy and flowing, and
            every thing </p>

            talent. Even to those publications which he compiled for booksellers, he
            communicated something of the charm of his own genius; and <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a> said of him with equal
            felicity and truth, "Nullum fere scribendi genus non tetigit, nullum quod
            tetigit non ornavit."<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> now took rooms in the
            Temple, and, along with a friend, a country-house on the Edgeware road. Here he
            wrote his <span class="italics">History of England, in Letters from a
               Nobleman to his Son</span>. These were long attributed to <a href="people.html#LytteltonGeorge">Lord Lyttleton</a>. Probably the
            booksellers were in no haste to undeceive the public. It is still in great
            credit as an introductory book for youth. He also produced, at different times,
            a <span class="italics">Roman History</span>, a <span class="italics">History of Greece,</span> and a <span class="italics">Life of <a href="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Bolingbroke</a></span>, and <span class="italics">of <a href="people.html#ParnellThomas">Parnell</a>,</span>
            prefixed to editions of their works.
         </p>
         <p>In 1768 he tried a new walk, and ventured upon the stage with his comedy of
            <span class="italics">The Goodnatured Man</span>, but
            without much success, though it possessed a good share of comic merit and
            originality. The public taste was at that time very much for sentimental
            comedyâ€”<span class="italics">la comÃ©die larmoyante</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span>â€” and
            <span class="italics">False Delicacy</span>, a play of
            <a href="people.html#KellyHugh">Kelly</a>'s, was acted with great
            applause at the other house.<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> It is said that poor
            <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> could never
            forgive <a href="people.html#KellyHugh">Kelly</a> his success. He however
            made 500<span class="italics">l</span>. by the piece; and if he had lost any
            popularity by it, it was amply regained by his <span class="italics">Deserted Village</span>, which he published in 1770, and of which
            he seems hardly to have been sen-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">sible of the merit; for he refused
            at first to take the hundred pounds which the bookseller offered for it, saying,
            it was five shillings a coupletâ€”more than the sale of a poem could ever
            repay. It may be thought, perhaps, that authors and booksellers understand one
            another better at this period.
         </p>
         <p>There is scarcely any poem in the English language, in which harmony, beautiful
            description, and pathos are united with greater effect than in this piece. The
            plan of it is an expansion of the concluding lines of <span class="italics">The Traveller</span>, and displays the same
            prejudice, if it be prejudice, against commercial opulence. Many inquiries were
            made at the time, where the village of "sweet Auburn" had been
            situated. It is to be found in the county of Roscommon: its population or
            depopulation existed probably only in the poet's fancy, as it does not
            appear that he ever visited Ireland after he had left it, but the images cannot
            be contemplated without the most lively emotion. The character of the good
            pastor does not suffer by a comparison with <a href="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</a>'s. It was probably meant for his brother, whom he
            describes in his address to him as "having retired to happiness and
            obscurity on an income of 40<span class="italics">l</span>. a year;" and
            for whom he seems to have entertained an ardent affection and esteem. The
            schoolmaster, and the village alehouse, are streaked with that humour which
            characterizes his <span class="italics">Vicar of
               Wakefield</span>. It is difficult to say which of his two poems has
            most poetical merit: but this was certainly the most popular. It interested the
            feelings. The four </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> last lines, as well as the ten concluding ones
            of <span class="italics">The Traveller</span>, were given him by
            <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>.
         </p>
         <p>Two years after this he hazarded another attempt to make the public laugh, and
            this time succeeded. His comedy <span class="italics">She Stoops to
               Conquer</span> is full of absurdities, and the humour of it hardly
            rises above farce. His friends had great apprehensions for its fate. <a href="people.html#CumberlandRichard">Mr. Cumberland</a>, in his
            <span class="italics">Memoirs</span>, gives a very
            entertaining account of the manÅ“uvres practised by his friends, by posting
            people in different parts of the house to laugh and clap at the appointed
            places, in order to secure its success. The author himself came into the house
            when they were beginning a hiss at some passage. "What noise is that?"
            said he, in much alarm. "Oh doctor," said <a href="people.html#ColmanGeorgeElder">Colman</a>, "do not be afraid
            of squibs, when we have been sitting these two hours upon a barrel of
            gunpowder." He did not forgive this sally.
         </p>
         <p>The last work <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> was
            employed in was his <span class="italics">History of the Earth and
               animated Nature</span>. He was but little of a naturalist, but he
            was a fine writer; and with the help of <a href="people.html#BuffonGeorges">Buffon</a> and other authors he produced a work popular and pleasing in
            high degree, though charged with errors by more scientific writers.
         </p>
         <p>The literary fame of <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a>
            was now established, and the profits of his labours were such as ought to have
            made his circumstances perfectly easy: but he was a man of no regularity or
            worldly prudence, and, besides a propensity to show and expense, he had
            contracted an unfortunate habit of gaming, which involved him in pecuniary
            distress: his constitution too began to </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ix]</p><p class="pnoindent">give way, and he fell into a
            state of dejection, in which he expressed almost a weariness of life. In this
            state he was seized with a fever, which, assisted by a large dose of medicine
            which he took contrary to the advice of his physician, carried him off in March,
            1774, at the early age of five-and-forty. A monument was erected for him in
            Westminster Abbey, with an elegant epitaph by his steady friend <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> was awkward and uncouth
            in his person and manners. He did not shine in company, and seems to have had
            more than common propensity to blundering and confusion of ideas which is
            generally attributed to his countrymen. He had no powers of conversation, and
            seems to have been in some measure the butt of the wits with whom he associated.
            This consciousness of inferiority, which is never perhaps felt so much as in
            what regards personal intercourse, probably occasioned the feeling of envy to
            which it is acknowledged he was unfortunately subject. He was generous; and a
            great part of his expenses, as well as the most laudable, consisted in
            benefactions to poor authors and other objects of his beneficence. He had known
            distress, and was never tardy in relieving it. In other respects he was a man of
            rather fine feelings than of pure morals. Unfortunately they do not always go
            together.
         </p>
         <p>The last piece that came from his pen was a little poem, entitled <span class="italics">Retaliation</span>, which was written by way
            of retort to the raillery of his friends at the literary club, who had been
            amusing themselves with writing humorous </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page x]</p><p class="pnoindent"> epitaphs upon him. The
            characters which, in the form of epitaphs, he has given in return, are drawn
            with spirit, and upon the whole cannot be called severe; but the sport of this
            kind always carries a sting in it. In the character of <a href="people.html#GarrickDavid">Garrick</a>, the inordinate appetite for
            praise of that accomplished actor was too truly touched not to irritate the
            jealousy of his self-love, and he retaliated by an epigrammatic fable of much
            more severity.

         <p>Of all the walks in which <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> exercised his genius, that of poetry is the one in which it
            shone the brightest. Of his compositions in this line the bulk is small; but for
            beautiful discription, touching sentiment, and a harmony of versification that
            operates like a charm upon any one who has an ear for poetry, they are scarcely
            exceeded by any in the language. His <span class="italics">Vicar of
               Wakefield</span> is the only Novel he ever wrote, and it is one of
            the most pleasing we have. It is in this work that the author's talent for
            humour most successfully displays itself. Many of the incidents are irresistibly
            comic. Such are the gravity and self-importance of Moses, when he produces his
            bargain of spectacles with silver rims; the expedition to church upon Blackberry
            and Dobbin; the family picture, which was too large to enter the doors; the
            slyness of the vicar in overturning the cosmetic, while he pretended to stir the
            fire; and the schemes and plottings of good notable Mrs. Primrose with her
            gooseberry wine. We are at once touched and diverted with the harmless vanities
            of the whole group, joined with innocence and benevolence. The character of the
            vicar somewhat resembles Par-</p>

            and perhaps still more the author's own village pastor, "a man to all
            the country dear."<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> He is distinguished from the former by an admirable vein of
            dry humour, and resembles him in the honest simplicity of a man without guile:
            to this is joined a touch of professional vanity. In the serious parts of the
            story his behaviour is highly dignified; and it is hoped there are few who can
            read his discourse in the prison, when the good man is stripped of his all and
            overwhelmed with calamities, without feeling those emotions at once salutary and
            gratifying, which goodness and piety bearing up against misfortune are
            calculated to inspire. The benevolence and piety of Adams have always something
            ludicrous in them: the Vicar of Wakefield is a higher character. His kind
            feelings towards his family, the affecting tenderness with which he receives
            again his repentant daughter, his hospitality and flowing benevolence, with his
            behaviour in every scene of distress, make him a pleasing and venerable
            character, and are evidently painted by a man who, whatever were his faults,
            strongly felt the enthusiasm of virtue and piety.

         <p>The plot of this piece is full of improbabilities and absurdities. All that
            relates to the two kept-mistresses is coarse and low; the character of Burchell,
            alias Sir William, is too romantic for a representation of real life, and even
            in his love there is a great want of delicacy, or he would not have insulted his
            mistress with pretending to make a match between her and the fellow
            Jenkinson:â€”but whatever be its faults, we easily </p>

            author, who has made us laugh, and has made us cry. In the adventures of the
            eldest son the author has related some of the vicissitudes of his own life. It
            must not be forgotten that this novel is enriched with two specimens of the
            author's poetical powers. The first, "When lovely woman stoops to
            folly,"<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> is
            wonderfully pathetic. It is sweet as music, and polished like a gem. <span class="italics">The Hermit</span> is a most pleasing tale,
            and has always been very popular. The idea of it is supposed to be taken from
            <a href="people.html#PercyThomas">Percy</a>'s <span class="italics">Friar of Orders grey</span>;<span class="sup"><a href="#11" id="back11"><sup>11</sup></a> </span> but <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a> asserted that if there
            was any resemblance; the <span class="italics">Friar</span> was
            taken from his <span class="italics">Hermit</span>, which he

            him he had made use of his plan to weave together fragments of <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</a>. It is worthy of
            remark that this novel has been imitated by <a href="people.html#LaFontaineJean">La Fontaine</a>, a very pleasing novel
            writer of the present age, under the title of <span class="italics">Tableaux de Famille</span>. <a href="people.html#LaFontaineJean">La Fontaine</a>, like our author,
            excels in pictures of domestic life and touches of <span class="italics">naÃ¯vetÃ©</span>; but he by no means possesses the humour, the
