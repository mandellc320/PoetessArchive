         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="italics"><span class="largest">T</span>HE Castle of
               Otranto</span> was written by The Honourable <a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">Horace Walpole</a>, son of Sir <a href="people.html#WalpoleRobert">Robert Walpole</a>, who at the close of
            his life became Earl of Orford. It was printed at Strawberry Hill, and composed,
            the author tells us in one of his letters, in eight days or rather evenings.
            Though a slight performance, it is calculated to make a great impression upon
            those who relish the fictions of the <span class="italics">Arabian
               Tales</span>, and similar performances. It was one of the first of
            the modern productions founded on appearances of terror.

         <p> Since this author's time, from the perusal of Mrs. <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Radcliffe</a>'s productions and
            some of the German tales, we may be said to have "supped full with
            horrors,"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> but none of
            those compositions have a livelier play of fancy than <span class="italics">The Castle of Otranto</span>. It is the
            sportive effusion of a man of genius, who throws the reins loose upon the neck
            of his imagination. The large limbs of the gigantic figure which inhabits the
            castle, and which are visible at intervals; the plumes of the helmet, which rise
            and wave with ominous meaning; and the various enchant-</p>

            are imagined with the richness and wildness of poetic fancy. A sufficient degree
            of interest is thrown into the novel part of the story; but in the characters of
            some of the attendants there is an attempt at humour which has not
            succeeded.
         </p>
         <p>The works of <a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">Horace Walpole</a> are
            well known. He was a gentleman author, and wrote and printed for his own
            amusement, living in literary ease at his elegant seat of Strawberry Hill, in
            the architecture and furniture of which he has also shown a predilection for the
            romantic ideas connected with gothic and chivalrous times. He always moved in
            the highest circles of company, and joined the man of fashion and man of wit to
            the elegant scholar. Mr. <a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">Walpole</a>
            was fond of French literature, and few Englishmen have more imbibed the spirit
            and taste of the writers of that nation. His little jeu d'esprit upon <a href="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</a> is well known.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p><span class="italics">The Castle of Otranto</span> is much in the
            spirit of the tales of <a href="people.html#HamiltonAnthony">Count
               Hamilton</a>. In one of those tales we meet with a vast leg of a giant,
            which probably suggested the prodigy in the former. <a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">Horace Walpole</a> wrote, <span class="italics">A Catalogue of royal and noble
               Authors</span>; <span class="italics">Anecdotes of Painting,
               enlarged from Vertue</span>; <span class="italics">An
               Essay on modern Gardening</span>, in which there is a good deal of
            taste; and <span class="italics">The Mysterious Mother,</span> a
            tragedy. The last work was much spoken of while it was handed about with a
            certain air of secrecy,<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> but
            sunk into neglect soon after it was published. Not but that there are some fine
            lines, and some strong moral sentiment in the piece; but no play</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">could be expected to support itself under a subject so disgustingly repulsive.
            The story itself is in the <span class="italics">Gesta
               Romanorum</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> and in <a href="people.html#TaylorJeremy">Taylor</a>'s <span class="italics">Cases of Conscience</span>; and as in a play
            it never could be acted, it had better have remained in the form of a story.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">Lord Orford</a>'s works have been
            published since his death, in a pompous edition,<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> with his letters
            and some posthumous fragments, in both of which there is a good deal of light
            easy wit and entertaining court anecdote; but what is new in them has not been
            made very accessible to the public in general, as it is not to be had without
            purchasing works which they were long before in possession of.
