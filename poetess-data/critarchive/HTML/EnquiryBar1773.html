            general observation many of our modern writers of tragedy and romance seem to
            have drawn this inference, that in order to please they have nothing more to do
            than to paint distress in natural and striking colours. With this view, they
            heap together all the afflicting events and dismal accidents their imagination
            can furnish; and when they have half broke the reader's heart, they expect
            he should thank them for his agreeable entertainment. An author of this class
            sits down, pretty much like an inquisitor, to compute how much suffering he can
            inflict upon the hero of his tale before he makes an end of him: with this
            difference, indeed, that the inquisitor only tortures those who are at least
            reputed criminals; whereas the writer generally chooses the most excellent
            character in his piece for the subject of his persecution. The great criterion

         <p> A <span class="smcaps">monarch</span> once proposed a reward for the discovery
            of a new pleasure; but if any one could find out a new torture, or non-descript

         <p><span class="smcaps">But</span> the springs of pity require to be touched with
            a more delicate hand; and it is far from being true that we are agreeably
            affected by every thing that excites our sympathy. It shall therefore be the
            business of this Essay to distinguish those kinds of distress which are pleasing
            in the </p>

         </p>
         <p><span class="smcaps">The</span> view or relation of mere misery can never be
            pleasing. We have, indeed, a strong sympathy with all kinds of misery; but it is
            a feeling of pure unmixed pain, similar in kind, though not equal in degree to
            what we feel for ourselves on the like occasions; and never produces that
            melting sorrow, that thrill of tenderness, to which we give the name of pity.
            They are two distinct sensations, marked by very different external expression.
            One causes the nerves to tingle, the flesh to shudder, and the whole countenance
            to be thrown into strong contractions; the other relaxes the frame, opens the
            features, and produces tears. When we crush a noxious or loathsome animal, we
            may sympathize strongly with the pain it suffers, but with far different

            from the tender sentiment we feel for the dog of <a href="people.html#Ulysses">Ulysses</a>, who crawled to meet his
            long-lost master, looked up, and died at his feet.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> Extreme bodily pain is perhaps the most
            intense suffering we are capable of, and if the fellow feeling with misery alone
            was grateful to the mind, the exhibition of a man in a fit of the tooth-ach, or
            under a chirurgical operation, would have a fine effect in a tragedy. But there
            must be some other sentiment combined with this kind of instinctive sympathy,
            before it becomes in any degree pleasing, or produces the sweet emotion of pity.
            This sentiment is love, esteem, the complacency we take in the contemplation of
            beauty, of mental or moral excellence, called forth and rendered more
            interesting, by circumstances of pain and danger. Tenderness is, much more
            properly than sorrow, the spring of tears; for it affects us in that manner </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 195]</p><p class="pnoindent">whether combined with joy or grief; perhaps more in the former case
            than the latter. And I believe we may venture to assert, that no distress which
            produces tears is wholly without a mixture of pleasure. When Joseph's
            brethren were sent to buy corn, if they had perished in the desart by wild
            beasts, or been reduced (as in the horrid adventures of a Pierre de Vaud<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span>) to eat one another,
            we might have shuddered, but we should not have wept for them. The gush of tears
            is when Joseph made himself known to his brethren, and fell on their neck, and
            kissed them.<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> When Hubert prepares to burn out prince
            Arthur's eyes, the shocking circumstance, of itself, would only affect us
            with horror; it is the amiable simplicity of the young prince, and his innocent
            affection to his intended murderer that draws our tears, and excites that tender
            sorrow which we love to feel, </p>

         <p><span class="smcaps">We</span> see, therefore, from this view of our internal
            feelings, that no scenes of misery ought to be exhibited which are not connected
            with the display of some moral excellence or agreeable quality. If fortitude,
            power, and strength of mind are called forth, they produce the sublime feelings
            of wonder and admiration: if the softer qualities of gentleness, grace, and
            beauty, they inspire love and pity. The management of these latter emotions is
            our present object.
         </p>
         <p><span class="smcaps">And</span> let it be remembered, in the first place, that
            the misfortunes which excite pity must not be too horrid and overwhelming. The
            mind is rather stunned than softened by great calamities. They are little
            circumstances that work most </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 197]</p><p class="pnoindent">sensibly upon the tender feelings. For
            this reason, a well-written novel generally draws more tears than a tragedy. The
            distresses of tragedy are more calculated to amaze and terrify, than to move
            compassion. Battles, torture and death are in every page. The dignity of the
            characters, the importance of the events, the pomp of verse and imagery interest
            the grander passions, and raise the mind to an enthusiasm little favourable to
            the weak and languid notes of pity. The tragedies of <a href="people.html#YoungEdward">Young</a> are in a fine strain of poetry,
            and the situations are worked up with great energy, but the pictures are in too
            deep a shade: all his pieces are full of violent and gloomy passions, and so
            over-wrought with horror, that instead of awakening any pleasing sensibility,
            they leave on the mind an impression of sadness mixed with terror. <a href="people.html.#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</a> is sometimes

            Andronicus. But <a href="people.html#LeeNathaniel">Lee</a>,
            beyond all others, abounds with this kind of images. He delighted in painting
            the most daring crimes, and cruel massacres; and though he has shewn himself
            extremely capable of raising tenderness, he continually checks its course by
            shocking and disagreeable expressions. His pieces are in the same taste with the
            pictures of <a href="people.html#RiberaJusepe">Spagnolet</a>, and there
            are many scenes in his tragedies which no one can relish who would not look with
            pleasure on the flaying of St. Bartholomew. The following speech of
            Marguerité, in the massacre of Paris, was, I suppose,
            intended to express the utmost tenderness of affection. </p>

            too free with the more violent expressions of passion and distress, by which
            means they lose their effect. Thus an ordinary author does not know how to
            express any strong emotion otherwise than by swoonings or death; so that a
            person experienced in this kind of reading, when a girl faints away at parting

            knowledge of human nature would have suggested a thousand little touches of
            grief, which though slight are irresistible. We are too gloomy a people. Some of
            the French novels are remarkable for little affecting incidents, imagined with
            delicacy and told with grace. Perhaps they have a better turn than we for this

            Deformity is always disgusting, and the imagination cannot
            reconcile it with the idea of a favourite character; therefore the poet and

            principal figures than is usually met with in common life. A late genius,

            moment: there seems to be a charm about her which prevents her receiving a stain

         <p><span class="smcaps">Pity</span> seems too degrading a sentiment to be offered
            at the shrine of faultless excellence. The sufferings of martyrs are rather
            beheld with admiration and sympathetic triumph than with tears; and we never
            feel much for those whom we consider as themselves raised above common
            feelings.
         </p>
         <p><span class="smcaps">The</span> last rule I shall insist upon is, that scenes of
            distress should not be too long continued. All our finer feelings are in a
            manner momentary, and no art can carry them beyond a certain point, either in
            intenseness or duration. Constant suffering deadens the heart to tender
            impressions; as we many observe in sailors, and others who are grown callous by
            a life of continual hardships. It is therefore highly necessary in a long work
            to relieve the mind by scenes of pleasure and gaiety: and I cannot think it so

            intermix wit and fancy with the pathetic, provided care be taken not to check
            the passions while they are flowing. The transition from a pleasurable state of
            mind to tender sorrow is not so difficult as we imagine. When the mind is opened
            by gay and agreeable scenes, every impression is felt more sensibly. Persons of
            lively temper are much more susceptible of that sudden swell of sensibility
            which occasions tears, than those of a grave and saturnine cast: for this reason
            women are more easily moved to weeping than men. Those who have touched the
            springs of pity with the finest hand have mingled light strokes of pleasantry
            and mirth in their most pathetic passages. Very different is the conduct of many
            novel writers, who by plunging us into scenes of distress without end or limit,

            thing, or fix a real sadness upon the mind. The uniform stile of tragedies is
            one reason why they affect so little. In our old plays all the force of language
            is reserved for the more interesting parts; and in the scenes of common life
            there is no attempt to rise above common language: whereas we, by that pompous
            manner and affected solemnity which we think it necessary to preserve through
            the whole piece, lose the force of an elevated or passionate expression where
            the occasion really suggests it.
         </p>
         <p><span class="smcaps">Having</span> thus considered the manner in which
            fictitious distress must be managed to render it pleasing, let us reflect a
            little upon the moral tendency of such representations. Much has been said in
            favour of them, and they are generally </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 211]</p><p class="pnoindent">thought to improve the
            tender and humane feelings; but this, I own, appears to me very dubious. That
            they exercise sensibility is true, but sensibility does not increase with
            exercise. By the constitution of our frame our habits increase, our emotions
            decrease, by repeated acts; and thus a wise provision is made, that as our
            compassion grows weaker, its place should be supplied by habitual benevolence.
            But in these writings our sensibility is strongly called forth without any
            possibility of exerting itself in virtuous action, and those emotions, which we
            shall never feel again with equal force, are wasted without advantage. Nothing
            is more dangerous than to let virtuous impressions of any kind pass through the
            mind without producing their proper effect. The awakenings of remorse, virtuous

            to action, grow less and less vivid every time they recur, till at length the
            mind grows absolutely callous. The being affected with a pathetic story is
            undoubtedly a sign of an amiable disposition, but perhaps no means of increasing
            it. On the contrary, young people, by a course of this kind of reading, often
            acquire something of that apathy and indifference which the experience of real
            life would have given them, without its advantages.
         </p>
         <p><span class="smcaps">Another</span> reason why plays and romances do not improve
            our humanity is, that they lead us to require a certain elegance of manners and
            delicacy of virtue which is not often found with poverty, ignorance, and
            meanness. The objects of pity in romance are as different from those in real
            life as our husbandmen from </p>

            who will sit weeping the whole night at the delicate distresses of a lady
            Charlotte or lady Julia, shall be little moved at the complaint of her
            neighbour, who, in a homely phrase and vulgar accent, laments to her that she is
            not able to get bread for her family. Romance-writers likewise make great
            misfortunes so familiar to our ears, that we have hardly any pity to spare for
            the common accidents of life: but we ought to remember, that misery has a claim
            to relief, however we may be disgusted with its appearance; and that we must not
            fancy ourselves charitable, when we are only pleasing our imagination.

            idea. The high notions of honour, the wild and fanciful spirit of adventure and
            romantic love, elevated the mind; our novels tend to depress and enfeeble it.
            Yet there is a species of this kind of writing which must ever afford an
            exquisite pleasure to persons of taste and sensibility; where noble sentiments
            are mixed with well-fancied incidents, pathetic touches with dignity and grace,

            visitants forsook their polluted abodes. Love alone remained, having been stolen
            away by Hope, who was his nurse, and conveyed by her to the forests of Arcadia,
            where he was brought up among the shepherds. But Jupiter assigned him a

            He complied with reluctance; for her features were harsh and disagreeable, her

            covered with a wreath of cypress and wormwood. From this union sprung a virgin,

            in the cabin where she was born; and while she was yet an infant, a dove pursued

            and gentle a mien that she was beloved to a degree of enthusiasm. Her voice was
            low and plaintive, but inexpressibly sweet; and she loved to lie for hours
            together on the banks of some wild and melancholy stream, singing to her lute.
            She taught men to weep, for she took a strange delight in tears; and often, when

            broken. She follows with her hair loose, her bosom bare and throbbing, her

            I, Duke of Brittany (1187-1203) had been named successor to the throne
            over his uncle John, King of England (1167-1216), who therefore had the
            young duke imprisoned. The prison warden, Hubert de Burgh, was ordered
            to put out Arthur's eyes, but he was so touched by the boy's
            appeal to his pity and affection that he could not do it but instead
            falsely reported to the king that he had carried out the mutilation. See
