            					Poetry may be reduced under two comprehensive classes. The first includes all
            in
            					which the charms of verse are made use of, to illustrate subjects which in their
            					own nature are affecting or interesting. Such are Didactic and Dramatic
            					compositions. Such is the Epic, where a story, a series of adventures, carries
            					the reader on through the impulse of curiosity, and loses not its interest
            					intirely even if translated into Prose. Such are descriptions of natural
            					objects, where the mind recognizes with pleasure the forms and colouring it

            					moral painting of men and manners, that spontaneously approves itself to the
            					spirit of observation, and the moral sense, that more or less are implanted in
            					the breast of every man. Hence the Essays and Epistles of <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander"><span class="smcaps">Pope</span></a>
            					have been popular among all that read. A lively representation of the <span class="italics">passions</span>, particularly those of love, terror, and
            					pity, commands the attention even of those who are but indifferent judges of
            the
            					vehicle in which it may be conveyed. The other class consists of what may be
            					called pure Poetry, or Poetry in the abstract. It is conversant with an
            					imaginary world, peopled with beings of its own creation. It deals in splendid
            					imagery, bold fiction, and allegorical personages. It is necessarily obscure
            to
            					a certain degree; because, having to do chiefly with ideas generated within the
            					mind, it cannot be at all comprehended by any whose intellect has not been
            					exercised in similar contemplations; while the conceptions of the Poet (often
            					highly metaphysical) are rendered still </p>

            					apprehension by the figurative phrase in which they are clothed. All that is
            					properly <span class="italics">Lyric Poetry</span> is of this kind. It depends
            					for effect on the harmony of the verse, which must be modulated with the nicest
            					care; and on a felicity of expression, rather than a fullness of thought. An
            					Epic Poem may be compared to a piece of massy plate finely wrought; it is
            					intrinsically valuable, though its value is much increased by the work bestowed
            					upon it. An Ode, like a delicate piece of silver filligree, receives in a manner
            					all its value from the art and curiosity of the workmanship. Hence Lyric Poetry
            					will very seldom bear translation, which is a kind of melting down of a Poem,
            					and reducing it to the sterling value of the matter contained in it. Who can

            					ought to have large allowance made before this accusation is fixed upon him.
            A
            					real Poet must always appear indolent to the man of the world. The alacrity and

            					requires long intervals of ease and leisure; his imagination should be fed with
            					novelty, and his ear soothed by praise. But it was not the fortune of <a href="people.html#CollinsWilliam"><span class="smcaps">Collins</span></a> to meet with that notice which his productions have

            					ear and on the mind. The hurried step, the haggard eye, the withering power of
            					Fear, are all highly characteristic. <span class="italics">Danger</span> with
            					gigantic limbs enjoying the midnight storm, and sleeping on a loose precipice;

            					to keep intirely separate the active and passive qualities of allegorical
            					personages: difficult to say whether such a being as Fear should be the agent
            in
            					inspiring, or the victim agitated by the passion. In this Ode the latter idea
            					prevails, for Fear appears in the character of a nymph pursued, like <span class="smcaps">Dryden</span>'s Honoria, by the ravening </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxi]</p><p class="pnoindent">brood of Fate. She is distracted by the ghastly train conjured up by Danger,
            					and hunted through the world without being suffered to take repose; yet this
            					idea is somewhat departed from, when the Poet endeavours to <span class="italics">propitiate</span> Fear by offering her as a suitable
            					abode, <span class="italics">the cell where Rape and Murder dwell;</span> or a
            					cave, whence she may hear <span class="italics">the cries of drowning

            					gratification, who investigates the attributes of these shadowy beings with too
            					nice and curious an eye. In his reference to the goblins of Midsummer eve, the

            					of his country, which he afterwards indulged more fully in his Ode on the
            						Highland Superstition; a piece he did not live to finish. The
            					division of this Ode into Epode and Antistrophe is no advantage to it. The

            					cestus of poetic powers, can only be worn by him whom Nature has cast in the
            					mould of true genius. So far is apt and intelligible; but the Poet afterwards,
            					actuated as it should seem by a vague desire of exalting his favorite
            					occupation, rather than by any clear and distinct ideas, goes on to say how this
            					cestus was produced. His allegory here is neither luminous nor decent. The
            					Supreme Being, he tells us, being in a <span class="italics">diviner mood

            					enjoy much of the public favor; but posterity has done him justice, and assigned
            					him an honorable rank among those of our Poets who are more distinguished by
