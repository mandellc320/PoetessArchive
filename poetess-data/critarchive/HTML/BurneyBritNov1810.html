         <p> It is necessary to speak of living authors with that temperance of praise which
            may not offend their delicacy; and though this lady by marriage with a
            foreigner, and her residence abroad, is in a manner lost to this her native
            country, the writer of these remarks does not feel herself at liberty to search
            for anecdotes which might gratify curiosity, or endeavour to detail the events
            of a life which every admirer of genius will wish prolonged to many succeeding
            years. One anecdote, however, may be mentioned, which is current, and she
            believes has never been contradicted. <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss

            the early bloom of youth, about seventeen. She wrote it without the knowledge of
            any of her friends. With the modesty of a young woman, and the diffidence of a
            young author, she contrived to throw it into the press anonymously, and, when
            published, laid the volumes in the way of her friends, whose impartial plaudits
            soon encouraged her to confess to whom they were obliged for their
            entertainment. There is perhaps no purer or higher pleasure than the young mind
            enjoys in the first burst of praise and admiration which attends a successful
            performance. To be lifted up at once into the favourite of the public; to be
            sensible that the name, hitherto pronounced only in the circle of family
            connexions, is become familiar to all that read, through every province of a
            large kingdom; to feel in the glow of genius and freshness of invention powers
            to continue that admiration to future years;—to feel all this, and at the
            same time to be happily ignorant of all the chills and mortifications, the
            impossibility not to flag in a long work, the ridicule and censure which fasten
            on vulnerable parts, and the apathy or diffidence which generally seizes an
            author before his literary race is run;—this is happiness for youth, and
            youth alone. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Evelina</span> became at once a fashionable
            novel: there are even those who still prefer it to <span class="italics">Cecilia</span>, though that preference is
            probably owing to the partiality inspired by a first performance. Evelina is a
            young lady, amiable and inexperienced, who is continually getting into
            difficulties from not knowing or not observing the established </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">etiquettes of society, and from being unluckily connected with a number of
            vulgar characters, by whom she is involved in a series of adventures both
            ludicrous and mortifying. Some of these are certainly carried to a very
            extravagant excess, particularly the tricks played upon the poor Frenchwoman;
            but the fondness for humour, and low humour, which <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</a> discovered in this piece,
            runs through all her subsequent works, and strongly characterizes, sometimes
            perhaps blemishes, her genius. Lord Orville is a generous and pleasing lover;
            and the conclusion is so wrought, as to leave upon the mind that glow of
            happiness which is not found in her subsequent works. The meeting between
            Evelina and her father is pathetic. The agonizing remorse and perturbation of
            the man who is about to see, for the first time, his child whom he had deserted,
            and whose mother had fallen a sacrifice to his unkindness; the struggles between
            the affection which impels him towards her, and the dread he feels of seeing in
            her the image of his injured wife; are described with many touches of nature and
            strong effect.—Other characters in the piece are, Mrs. Selwyn, a wit and
            an oddity; a gay insolent baronet; a group of vulgar cits; a number of young
            bucks, whose coldness, carelessness, rudeness, and impertinent gallantry, serve
            as a foil to the delicate attentions of Lord Orville. 
         </p>
         <p>Upon the whole, <span class="italics">Evelina</span> greatly
            pleased; and the interest the public took in the young writer was rewarded with
            fresh pleasure by the publication of <span class="italics">Cecilia</span>, than which it would be difficult </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iv]</p><p class="pnoindent">to find a novel with more various and
            striking beauties. Among these may be reckoned the style, which is so varied,
            according to the characters introduced, that, without any information from the
            names, the reader would readily distinguish the witty loquacity of Lady Honoria
            Pemberton, the unmeaning volubility of Miss Larolles, the jargon of the captain,
            the affected indifference of Meadows, the stiff pomposity of Delville senior,
            the flighty heroics of Albany, the innocent simplicity of Miss Belfield, the
            coarse vulgarity of her mother, the familiar address and low comic of Briggs,
            and the cool finesse of the artful attorney, with many others,—all
            expressed in language appropriate to the character, and all pointedly
            distinguished from the elegant and dignified style of the author herself. The
            character of the miser Briggs is pushed, perhaps, to a degree of extravagance,
            though certainly not more so than <a href="people.html#Moliere">Moliere</a>'s Harpagon; but it is highly comic, and it is not the
            common idea of a miser half-starved, sullen and morose; an originality is given
            to it by making him jocose, good-humoured, and not averse to enjoyment when he
            can have it for nothing. All the characters are well discriminated, from the
            skipping Morrice, to the artful Monckton, and the high-toned feeling of Mrs.
            Delville. The least natural character is Albany. An idea prevailed at the time,
            but probably without the least foundation, that <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a> had supplied the
            part.

            situations di-</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">stressful and humiliating, by the peculiarity of her
            circumstances, and a flexibility and easiness readily pardoned in a young
            female. The restriction she is laid under of not marrying any one who will not
            submit to assume her name is a new circumstance, and forms, very happily, the
            plot of the piece. Love appears with dignity in Cecilia; with fervour, but
            strongly combated by pride as well as duty, in young Delville; with all the
            helplessness of unrestrained affection in Miss Belfield, whose character of
            simplicity and tenderness much resembles that of Emily in <span class="italics">Sir Charles Grandison</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> If resemblances are sought for, it may
            also be observed that the situation of Cecilia with Mrs. Delville is similar to
            that of <a href="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</a>'s Marianne with
            the mother of Valville.

         <p><a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</a> possess equal powers of
            pathos and of humour. The terrifying voice of the unknown person who forbids the
            banns has an electrifying effect upon the reader; and the distress of Cecilia
            seeking her husband about the streets, in agony for his life, till her reason
            suddenly fails, is almost too much to bear. Indeed we lay down the volumes with
            rather a melancholy impression upon our minds; there has been so much of
            distress that the heart feels exhausted, and there are so many deductions from
            the happiness of the lovers, that the reader is scarcely able to say whether the
            story ends happily or unhappily. It is true that in human life things are
            generally so balanced; but in fictitious writings it is more agreeable, if they
            are not </p>

         </p>
         <p> But the finest part of these volumes is the very moral and instructive story of
            the <span class="italics">Harrels</span>. It is the high praise of <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</a>, that she has not
            contented herself with fostering the delicacies of sentiment, and painting in
            vivid colours those passions which nature has made sufficiently strong. She has
            shown the value of economy, the hard-heartedness of gaiety, the mean rapacity of
            the fashionable spendthrift. She has exhibited a couple, not naturally bad, with
            no other inlet to vice, that appears on the face of the story, than the
            inordinate desire of show and splendour, withholding his hard-earned pittance
            from the poor labourer, and lavishing it on every expensive trifle. She has
            shown the wife trifling and helpless, vain, incapable of serious thought or
            strong feeling; and has beautifully delineated the gradual extinction of an
            early friendship between two young women whom youth and cheerfulness alone had
            assimilated, as the two characters diverged in afterlife,—a circumstance
            that frequently happens. She has shown the husband fleecing his guest and his
            ward by working on the virtuous feelings of a young mind, and has conducted him
            by natural steps to the awful catastrophe. The last scene at Vauxhall is
            uncommonly animated; every thing seems to pass before the reader's eyes.
            The forced gaiety, the starts of remorse, the despair, the bustle and glare of
            the place, the situation </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">of the unprotected females in such scene
            of horror, are all most forcibly described. We almost hear and feel the report
            of the pistol.—In the uncommon variety of characters which this novel
            affords, there are many other deserving of notice; that, for instance, of the
            high-minded romantic Belfield may give a salutary lesson to many a youth who
            fancies his part in life <span class="italics">ill cast,</span> who wastes life
            in projects, and does nothing because he thinks every thing beneath his ambition
            and his talents.
         </p>
         <p> Such are the various merits of <span class="italics">Cecilia</span>, through the whole of which it is evident that the
            author draws from life, and exhibits not only the passions of human nature, but
            the manners of the age and the affectation of the day.
         </p>
         <p> The celebrity which <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Miss Burney</a> had
            now attained awakened the idea of extending that patronage to her which, in most
            countries, it has been usual in one way or other to hold out to literary merit;
            and it was thought, we must presume, the most appropriate reward of her
            exertions, and the happiest method of fostering her genius, that she was made
            <span class="italics">dresser</span> to Her Majesty.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> She held this post for several years, during
            which the duties of her situation seem to have engrossed her whole time. Her
            state of health at length obliged her to resign it, and she was soon after
            married to <a href="people.html#ArblayGen">M. D'Arblay</a>, a French
            emigrant.
         </p>
         <p> She now again resumed her pen, and gave to the world her third publication,
            entitled <span class="italics">Camilla</span>. This work is
            somewhat too much protracted, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent">and is inferior to <span class="italics">Cecilia</span> as a whole, but it certainly
            exhibits beauties of as high an order. The character of Sir Hugh is new and
            striking. There is such an unconscious shrewdness in his remarks, that they have
            all the effect of the sharpest satire without his intending any malice; while,
            at the same time, his complaints are so meek, his self-humiliation so touching,
            his benevolence so genuine and overflowing, that the reader must have a bad
            heart who does not love while he laughs at him. The incidents of the piece show
            much invention, particularly that which induces Sir Hugh to adopt Eugenia
            instead of his favourite. How charmingly is Camilla described! "Every look
            was a smile, every step was a spring, every thought was a hope, and the early
            felicity of her mind was without alloy."
         </p>
         <p> Camilla, in the course of the work, falls, like Cecilia, into pecuniary
            difficulties. They are brought on partly by milliners' bills, which
            unawares and through the persuasion of others she has suffered to run up, but
            chiefly from being drawn in to assist an extravagant and unprincipled brother.
            The character of the brother, Lionel, is drawn with great truth and spirit, and
            presents but too just a picture of the manner in which many deserving females
            have been sacrificed to the worthless part of the family. The author appears to
            have viewed with a very discerning eye the manners of those young men who aspire
            to lead the fashion; and in all three of her novels has bestowed a good deal of
            her </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ix]</p><p class="pnoindent">satire upon the affected apathy, studied negligence, coarse
            slang, avowed selfishness, or mischievous frolic, by which they often
            distinguish themselves, and through which they contrive to be vulgar with the
            advantages of rank, mean with those of fortune, and disagreeable with those of
            youth.
         </p>
         <p> A very original character in this work is that of Eugenia. Her surprise and
            sorrow when, at the age of fifteen, she first discovers her deformity, and her
            deep, gentle, dignified sorrow for the irremediable misfortune, it is impossible
            to peruse without sympathy; and in the incident which follows, when her father,
            after a discourse the most rational and soothing, brings her to the sight of a
            beautiful idiot, the scene is one of the most striking and sublimely moral any
            where to be met with.
         </p>
         <p> As well as great beauties there are great faults in <span class="italics">Camilla</span>. It is blemished by the
            propensity which the author has shown in all her novels, betrayed into it by her
            love of humour, to involve her heroines not only in difficult but in degrading
            adventures. The mind may recover from distress, but not from disgrace; and the
            situations Camilla is continually placed in with the Dubsters and Mrs. Mittin
            are of a nature to degrade. Still more, the overwhelming circumstance of her
            father's being sent to prison for her debts seems to preclude the
            possibility of her ever raising her head again. It conveys a striking lesson;
            and no doubt <a href="people.html#ArblayMadameD">Mrs. D'Arblay</a>,
            in her large acquaintance with life, must have often </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page x]</p><p class="pnoindent">seen the
            necessity of inculcating, even upon <span class="italics">young</span> ladies,
            the danger of running up bills on credit; but the distress becomes too deep, too
            humiliating, to admit of a happy conclusion. The mind has been harassed and worn
            with excess of painful feeling. At the conclusion of <span class="italics">Clarissa</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> we are dismissed in calm and not
            unpleasing sorrow; but on the winding up of <span class="italics">Cecilia</span> and <span class="italics">Camilla</span> we are somewhat tantalized with imperfect happiness.
            It must be added, that the interest is more divided in <span class="italics">Camilla</span> than in the author's
            former work, and the adventures of Eugenia become at length too improbable.
         </p>
         <p> Among the new characters in this piece is Mrs. Arlberry, a woman of fashion,
            with good sense and taste, but fond of frivolity through <span class="italics">désœuvrement</span>, and amusing herself with a
            little court about her of fashionable young men, whom she at the same time
            entertains and despises.
         </p>
         <p> In short, <a href="people.html#ArblayMadameD">Mrs. D'Arblay</a> has
            observed human nature, both in high and low life, with the quick and penetrating
            eye of genius. Equally happy in seizing the ridiculous, and in entering into the
            finer feelings, her pictures of manners are just and interesting, and the
            highest value is given to them by the moral feelings they exercise, and the
            excellent principles they inculcate.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#ArblayMadameD">Mrs. D'Arblay</a> lived some
            years after her marriage at a sweet retirement in the shade of Norbury park, in
