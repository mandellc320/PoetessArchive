            production of the Rev. <a href="people.html#GravesRichard">Richard
               Graves</a>, rector of Claverton in Somersetshire; a gentleman who has been
            considerably distinguished in the literary world for above half a century. His
            father was <a href="people.html#GravesRichardSr.">Richard Graves</a>, Esq.
            of Mickleton in Gloucestershire, who died in 1729, and was a man of learning,
            particularly in the history and antiquities of his country.
         </p>
         <p>The author of this work was born at Mickleton, the seat of his father and
            grandfather, on May 4, 1715, and received his early education under the Rev. Mr.
            Smith,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> the curate of the
            parish. About the age of thirteen he was removed thence to the school of
            Abingdon in Berkshire; the reputation of which, at that time, stood very high.
            At the age of sixteen, he was chosen scholar of Pembroke college, Oxford, where
            he was soon distinguished for uncommon proficiency.
         </p>
         <p>Such was his eagerness for classical knowledge, that he had not been long at
            Oxford before he join-</p>

            <a href="people.html#Epictetus">Epictetus</a>, <a href="people.html#Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, and such Greek
            authors as were not, at that time, recommended in the common course of study;
            and it is much to the credit of this party, that their only beverage at these
            meetings, was water. It was about this time that he became acquainted with <a href="people.html#ShenstoneWilliam">Shenstone</a> the poet; and their
            intimacy, which continued till the death of the latter, was frequently renewed
            by epistolary correspondence, part of which has been published. There does not
            appear to have been a perfect coincidence of sentiment between them in matters
            of taste; but in general there was a congeniality, and a harmony of opinion and
            friendship, which added not inconsiderably to the happiness of both.
         </p>
         <p>In 1736, <a href="people.html#GravesRichard">Mr. Graves</a> having left
            Pembroke, was elected a fellow of All Souls; but, instead of pursuing
            theological studies, as he first intended, he was led to the study of physic,
            and attended two courses of anatomical lectures in London. From this, however,
            he was diverted by a long and dangerous illness, which left him in a very
            languid state; and on his recovery, he resumed his original intention, and was
            admitted to holy orders in 1740, at which time also he took his master's
            degree.
         </p>
         <p>Some time after he went to reside with <a href="people.html#FitzherbertWilliam">Mr. Fitzherbert</a>, at Tissington
            in Derbyshire, who had a donative in his gift, and was desirous of the company
            of a clergyman. In this house, <a href="people.html#GravesRichard">Mr.
               Graves</a> enjoyed the advantage of elegant society for nearly</p>

            three years. While making a tour in the north, he accidentally met with a
            relation at Scarborough, <a href="people.html#KnightSamuel">Dr. Samuel
               Knight</a>, archdeacon of Berkshire, by whose recommendation he obtained a
            curacy near Oxford; which, at this time, became necessary, as he had come into
            office in his college, and was obliged to reside within a convenient distance.
            For this purpose he lodged with a gentleman farmer in the neighbourhood, whose
            youngest daughter, a very amiable young lady, so far captivated him, that he
            resigned his fellowship and married her.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> This incident, with some fictitious
            circumstances, is supposed to be related in the present work, in the history of
            Mr. Rivers.
         </p>
         <p>About the year 1750, he was presented by <a href="people.html#SkrineWilliam">Mr. Skrine</a> to the rectory of Claverton, on which he resided very
            constantly during the whole of his life; and filled up his time, as well as
            improved his circumstances, by taking a few pupils to be educated with his
            children. In 1763 he was presented to the living of Kilmersdon, through the
            interest of his steady friend <a href="people.html#AllenRalph">Ralph
               Allen</a>, Esq. of Prior Park, who likewise procured him a scarf<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> from <a href="people.html#PittHester">Lady Chatham</a>.

         <p>Although <a href="people.html#GravesRichard">Mr. Graves</a> frequently
            employed his pen on light and gay subjects, he did not commence author until the
            year 1765, when he published The Festoon, a collection of
            Epigrams, chosen with great judgment, and prefaced by a valuable critical essay
            on that species of composition, for which he received a silver medal, offered

            of The Festoon was, however, not great; although, perhaps, as
            much as he expected. It was followed, at short intervals, by Lucubrations
            in Prose and Rhime — The Spiritual Quixote
            — A Treatise on Politeness, translated from the Italian of

            Rout-Fleurettes, a translation of Archbishop <a href="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</a>'s Ode on

            Opera of Echo and Narcissus — Sermons on various Subjects

            Farmer's Daughter — The Invalid, with the
            obvious Means of enjoying Long Life, by a Nonagenarian — and
            Senilities.
         </p>
         <p>The merit of these compositions is various; but the general character of all <a href="people.html#GravesRichard">Mr. Graves</a>'s works resolves
            itself into benevolence, instruction, and harmless amusement. He was himself the
            amiable character he frequently portrays; and, by habits of cheerfulness and
            temperance, prolonged his life free from blame and care, until his ninetieth
            year, when he expired after a very short illness.</p>

         <p>Of the works now enumerated, the Spiritual Quixote, has been by
            far the most popular. Independent of the design, which at the time of
            publication, was an object of some importance, the execution of it made it soon
            be ranked among those productions which are chiefly admired for ingenuity of
            fiction. By occasionally introducing real characters and authenticated
            narratives, he has also diffused a charm over the whole, by which curiosity is
            excited and gratified in the most pleasing manner. </p>
