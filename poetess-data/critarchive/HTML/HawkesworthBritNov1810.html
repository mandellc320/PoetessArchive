         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">T</span>HE praise which was
            universally bestowed on the little Eastern tales which <a href="people.html#HawkesworthJohn">Dr. Hawkesworth</a> had introduced in
            the papers of his <span class="italics">Adventurer</span>,
            probably suggested to him the idea of giving a more extended story in the same
            style, and produced his <span class="italics">Almoran and
               Hamet</span>. It is not, however, equal to the beautiful allegory of
            the <span class="italics">ring</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> or the sublime imagery of <span class="italics">Carazan</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> In extended compositions of this kind, we miss the
            captivating richness and wildness of the genuine Eastern tales; and the desire
            to elicit a moral is commonly too apparent. The style also, which is generally
            adopted in these tales, inclines to the turgid, and is apt to become tiresome in
            a narrative of any length. <span class="italics">Vathek</span><span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span>is the only
            modern composition which has seized the genuine spirit of the Arabian tales:
            there is indeed in that fiction so much of the fancy peculiar to the East, that
            it is difficult to imagine it has not had some genuine tale of that origin for
            its basis.
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Almoran and Hamet</span> may,
            notwithstanding, be read with a degree of pleasure, especially by</p>

            allegorical mode of writing is generally more agreeable than it is to those of
            more advanced life. The design is to show that no outward circumstances, even
            such as may be produced by changing the course of nature, are sufficient to
            procure happiness, if the mind is not fitted for it by virtuous dispositions.
            There is merit in the idea of making Almoran, under the form of Hamet, incapable
            of taking advantage of his transformation in securing the affections of his
            mistress, which become immediately alienated from that beloved form, when she
            finds the mind of her supposed lover no longer the same. She despises Almoran
            under the form of Hamet, and transfers her love to the real Hamet, believing him
            to be Almoran: but much more might have been made of the frame of the story than
            is made of it.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#HawkesworthJohn">Dr. Hawkesworth</a>'s genius was
            not of the first order; but it was elegant, pleasing, and remarkably adapted to
            those purposes of moral instruction and innocent entertainment to which he
            uniformly devoted it.
