         <p><span class="largest">I</span><span class="smcaps">t</span> is natural for a
            writer, who is about to submit his works to the Publick, to feel a strong
            inclination, by some Preliminary Address, to conciliate the favour of his
            reader, and dispose him, if possible, to peruse them with a favourable eye. I am
            well aware, however, that his endeavours are generally fruitless: in his
            situation our hearts revolt from all appearance of confidence, and we consider
            his diffidence as hypocrisy. Our own word is frequently taken for what we say of
            ourselves, but very rarely for what we say of our works. Were these three plays,
            which this small volume contains, detached pieces only, and unconnected with
            others that do not yet appear, I should have suppressed this inclination
            altogether; and have allowed my reader to begin what is before him, and to form
            what opinion of it his taste or his humour might direct, without any previous
            trespass upon his time or his patience. But they are part of an extensive
            design: of one which, as far as my information goes, has nothing exactly similar
            to it in any language: of one which a whole life time will be </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 2]</p><p class="pnoindent"> limited enough to
            accomplish; and which has, therefore, a considerable chance of being cut short
            by that hand which nothing can resist. 
         </p>
         <p>Before I explain the plan of this work, I must make a demand upon the patience of
            my reader, whilst I endeavour to communicate to him those ideas regarding human
            nature, as they in some degree affect almost every species of moral writings,
            but particularly the Dramatic, that induced me to attempt it; and, as far as my
            judgment enabled me to apply them, has directed me in the execution of it.
         </p>
         <p>From that strong sympathy which most creatures, but the human above all, feel for
            others of their kind, nothing has become so much an object of man's
            curiosity as man himself. We are all conscious of this within ourselves, and so
            constantly do we meet with it in others, that like every circumstance of
            continually repeated occurrence, it thereby escapes observation. Every person,
            who is not deficient in intellect, is more or less occupied in tracing, amongst
            the individuals he converses with, the varieties of understanding and temper
            which constitute the characters of men; and receives great pleasure from every
            stroke of nature that points out to him those varieties. This is, much more than
            we are aware of, the occupation of children, and of grown people also, whose
            penetration is but lightly esteemed; </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 3]</p><p class="pnoindent">
         </p>
         <p>and that conversation which degenerates with them into trivial and mischievous
            tattling, takes its rise not unfrequently from the same source that supplies the
            rich vein of the satirist and the wit. That eagerness so universally shewn for
            the conversation of the latter, plainly enough indicates how many people have
            been occupied in the same way with themselves. Let any one, in a large company,
            do or say what is strongly expressive of his peculiar character, or of some
            passion or humour of the moment, and it will be detected by almost every person
            present. How often may we see a very stupid countenance animated with a smile,
            when the learned and the wise have betrayed some native feature of their own
            minds! and how often will this be the case when they have supposed it to be
            concealed under a very sufficient disguise! From this constant employment of
            their minds, most people, I believe, without being conscious of it, have stored
            up in idea the greater part of those strong marked varieties of human character,
            which may be said to divide it into classes; and in one of those classes they
            involuntarily place every new person they become acquainted with.
         </p>
         <p>I will readily allow that the dress and the manners of men, rather than their
            characters and disposition are the subjects of our common conversation, and seem
            chiefly to occupy the mul- </p>

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 4]</p><p class="pnoindent">titude. But let it be remembered that it is
            much easier to express our observations upon these. It is easier to communicate
            to another how a man wears his wig and cane, what kind of house he inhabits, and
            what kind of table he keeps, than from what slight traits in his words and
            actions we have been lead to conceive certain impressions of his character:
            traits that will often escape the memory, when the opinions that were founded
            upon them remain. Besides, in communicating our ideas of the characters of
            others, we are often called upon to support them with more expence of reasoning
            than we can well afford, but our observations on the dress and appearance of
            men, seldom involve us in such difficulties. For these, and other reasons too
            tedious to mention, the generality of people appear to us more trifling than
            they are: and I may venture to say that, but for this sympathetick curiosity
            towards others of our kind, which is so strongly implanted within us, the
            attention we pay to the dress and the manners of men would dwindle into an
            employment as insipid, as examining the varieties of plants and minerals, is to
            one who understands not natural history.
         </p>
         <p>In our ordinary intercourse with society, this sympathetick propensity of our
            minds is exercised upon men, under the common occurrences of life, in which we
            have often observed them. Here </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 5]</p><p class="pnoindent"> vanity and weakness put themselves
            forward to view, more conspicuously than the virtues: here men encounter those
            smaller trails, from which they are not apt to come off victorious; and here,
            consequently, that which is marked with the whimsical and ludicrous will strike
            us most forcibly, and make the strongest impression on our memory. To this
            sympathetick propensity of our minds, so exercised, the genuine and pure comick
            of every composition, whether drama, fable, story, or satire is addressed. 
         </p>
         <p>If man is an object of so much attention to man, engaged in the ordinary
            occurrences of life, how much more does he excite his curiosity and interest
            when placed in extraordinary situations of difficulty and distress? It cannot be
            any pleasure we receive from the sufferings of a fellow-creature which attracts
            such multitudes of people to a publick execution, though it is the horrour we
            conceive for such a spectacle that keeps so many more away. To see a human being
            bearing himself up under such circumstances, or struggling with the terrible
            apprehensions which such a situation impresses, must be the powerful incentive,
            which makes us press forward to behold what we shrink from, and wait with
            trembling expectation for what we dread.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> For though few </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 6]</p><p class="pnoindent"> at such a spectacle can
            get near enough to distinguish the expression of face, or the minuter parts of a
            criminal's behaviour, yet from a considerable distance will they eagerly
            mark whether he steps firmly; whether the motions of his body denote agitation
            or calmness; and if the wind does but ruffle his garment, they will, even from
            that change upon the outline of his distant figure, read some expression
            connected with his dreadful situation. Though there is a greater proportion of
            people in whom this strong curiosity will be overcome by other dispositions and
            motives; though there are many more who will stay away from such a sight than
            will go to it; yet there are very few who will not be eager to converse with a
            person who has beheld it; and to learn, very minutely, every circumstance
            connected with it, except the very act itself of inflicting death. To lift up
            the roof of his dungeon, like the <span class="italics">Diable
               boiteux</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> and look upon a criminal the night
            before he suffers, in his still</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 7]</p><p class="pnoindent">hours of privacy, when all that
            disguise, which respect for the opinion of others, the strong motive by which
            even the lowest and wickedest of men still continue to be moved, would present
            an object to the mind of every person, not withheld from it by great timidity of
            character, more powerfully attractive than almost any other. 
         </p>
         <p>Revenge, no doubt, first began amongst the savages of America that dreadful
            custom of sacrificing their prisoners of war. But the perpetration of such
            hideous cruelty could never have become a permanent national custom, but for
            this universal desire in the human mind to behold man in every situation,
            putting forth his strength against the current of adversity, scorning all bodily
            anguish, or struggling with those feelings of nature, which, like a beating
            stream, will oft'times burst through the artificial barriers of pride.
            Before they begin those terrible rites they treat their prisoner kindly; and it
            cannot be supposed that men, alternately enemies and friends to so many
            neighbouring tribes, in manners and appearance like themselves, should so
            strongly be actuated by a spirit of publick revenge. This custom, therefore,
            must be considered as a grand and terrible game, which every tribe plays against
            another; where they try not the strength of the arm, the swiftness of the feet,
            nor the acuteness of the eye, but the fortitude of the soul. Con-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 8]</p><p class="pnoindent">sidered in this light, the excess of cruelty exercised upon their miserable
            victim, in which every hand is described as ready to inflict its portion of
            pain, and every head ingenious in the contrivance of it, is no longer to be
            wondered at. To put into his measure of misery one agony less, would be, in some
            degree, betraying the honour of their nation: would be doing a species of
            injustice to every hero of their own tribe who had already sustained it, and to
            those who might be called upon to do so; amongst whom each of these savage
            tormentors has his chance of being one, and has prepared himself for it from his
            childhood. Nay, it would be a species of injustice to the haughty victim
            himself, who would scorn to purchase his place amongst the heroes of his nation,
            at an easier price than his undaunted predecessors.
         </p>
         <p>Amongst the many trials to which the human mind is subjected, that of holding
            intercourse, real or imaginary, with the world of spirits: of finding itself
            alone with a being terrifick and awful, whose nature and power are unknown, has
            been justly considered as one of the most severe. The workings of nature in this
            situation, we all know, have ever been the object of our most eager enquiry. No
            man wishes to see the Ghost himself, which would certainly procure him the best
            information on the subject, but every man wishes to see one who believes that he
            sees it, in all the </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 9]</p><p class="pnoindent">agitation and wildness of that species of
            terrour. To gratify this curiosity how many people have dressed up hideous
            apparitions to frighten the timid and superstitious! and have done it at the
            risk of destroying their happiness or understanding for ever. For the instances
            of intellect being destroyed by this kind of trial are more numerous, perhaps,
            in the proportion to the few who have undergone it than by any other.
         </p>
         <p>How sensible are we of this strong propensity within us, when we behold any
            person under the pressure of great and uncommon calamity! Delicacy and respect
            for the afflicted will, indeed, make us turn ourselves aside from observing him,
            and cast down our eyes in his presence; but the first glance we direct to him
            will involuntarily be one of the keenest observation, how hastily soever it may
            be checked; and often will a returning look of enquiry mix itself by stealth
            with our sympathy and reserve.
         </p>
         <p>But it is not in situations of difficulty and distress alone, that man becomes
            the object of this sympathetick curiosity; he is no less so when the evil he
            contends with arises in his own breast, and no outward circumstance connected
            with him either awakens our attention or our pity. What human creature is there,
            who can behold a being like himself under the violent agitation of those
            passions which all have, in some degree, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 10]</p><p class="pnoindent"> experienced, without
            feeling himself most powerfully excited by the sight? I say, all have
            experienced; for the bravest man on earth knows what fear is as well as the
            coward; and will not refuse to be interested for one under the dominion of this
            passion, provided there be nothing in the circumstances attending it to create
            contempt. Anger is a passion that attracts less sympathy than any other, yet the
            unpleasing and distorted features of an angry man will be more eagerly gazed
            upon, by those who are no wise concerned with his fury or the objects of it,
            than the most amiable placid countenance in the world. Every eye is directed to
            him; every voice hushed to silence in his presence; even children will leave off
            their gambols as he passes, and gaze after him more eagerly than the gaudiest
            equipage. The wild tossings of despair; the gnashing of hatred and revenge; the
            yearnings of affection, and the softened mien of love; all that language of the
            agitated soul, which every age and nation understands, is never addressed to the
            dull nor inattentive. 
         </p>
         <p>It is not merely under the violent agitations of passion, that man so rouses and
            interests us; even the smallest indications of an unquiet mind, the restless
            eye, the muttering lip, the half-checked exclamation, and the hasty start, will
            set our attention as anxiously upon the watch, as the </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 11]</p><p class="pnoindent"> first distant
            flashes of a gathering storm. When some great explosion of passion bursts forth,
            and some consequent catastrophe happens, if we are at all acquainted with the
            unhappy perpetrator, how minutely will we endeavour to remember every
            circumstance of his past behaviour! and with what avidity will we seize upon
            every recollected word or gesture, that is in the smallest degree indicative of
            the supposed state of his mind, at the time when they took place. If we are not
            acquainted with him, how eagerly will we listen to similar recollections from
            another! Let us understand, from observation of report, that any person harbours
            in his breast, concealed from the world's eye, some powerful rankling
            passion of what kind soever it may be, we will observe every word, every motion,
            every look, even the distant gait of such a man, with a constancy and attention
            bestowed upon no other. Nay, should we meet him unexpectedly on our way, a
            feeling will pass across our minds as though we found ourselves in the
            neighbourhood of some secret and fearful thing. If invisible, would we not
            follow him into his lonely haunts, into his closet, into the midnight silence of
            his chamber? There is, perhaps, no employment which the human mind will with so
            much avidity pursue, as the discovery of concealed passion, as the tracing the
            varieties and progress of a perturbed soul. 
         </p>
         <hr></hr>
         <p class="pageNumber">[Page 12]</p>
         <p>It is to this sympathetick curiosity of our nature, exercised upon mankind in
            great and trying occasions, and under the influence of the stronger passions,
            when the grand, the generous, the terrible attract our attention far more than
            the base and depraved, that the high and powerfully tragick, of every
            composition, is addressed.
         </p>
         <p>This propensity is universal. Children begin to shew it very early; it enters
            into many of their amusements, and that part of them too, for which they shew
            the keenest relish. It tempts them many times, as well as the mature in years,
            to be guilty of tricks, vexations, and cruelty; yet God Almighty has implanted
            it within us, as well as all our other propensities and passions, for wise and
            good purposes. It is our best and most powerful instructor. From it we are
            taught the propensities and decencies of ordinary life, and are prepared for
            distressing and difficult situations. In examining others we know ourselves.
            With limbs untorn, with head unsmitten, with senses unimpaired by despair, we
            know what we ourselves might have been on the rack, on the scaffold, and in the
            most afflicting circumstances of distress. Unless when accompanied with passions
            of the dark and malevolent kind, we cannot well exercise this disposition
            without becoming more just, more merciful, more compassionate; and as the dark
            and malevolent </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 13]</p><p class="pnoindent">passions are not the predominant inmates of the human
            breast, it hath produced more deeds—O many more! of kindness than of
            cruelty. It holds up for our example a standard of excellence, which, without
            its assistance, our inward consciousness of what is right and becoming might
            never have dictated. It teaches us, also, to respect ourselves, and our kind;
            for it is a poor mind, indeed, that from this employment of its faculties,
            learns not to dwell upon the noble view of human nature rather than the mean. 
         </p>
         <p>Universal, however, as this disposition undoubtedly is, with the generality of
            mankind it occupies itself in a passing and superficial way. Though a native
            trait of character or of passion is obvious to them as well as to the sage, yet
            to their minds it is but the visitor of a moment; they look upon it singly and
            unconnected: and though this disposition, even so exercised, brings instruction
            as well as amusement, it is chiefly by storing up in their minds those ideas to
            which the instructions of others refer, that it can be eminently useful. Those
            who reflect and reason upon what human nature holds out to their observation,
            are comparatively but few. No stroke of nature which engages their attention

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 14]</p><p class="pnoindent"> gave rise to it, but the relation of that feeling to others which
            are concealed. We wonder at the changes and caprices of men; they see in them
            nothing but what is natural and accountable. We stare upon some dark catastrophe
            of passion, as the Indians did upon an eclipse of the moon; they, conceiving the
            track of ideas through which the impassioned mind has passed, regard it like the
            philosopher who foretold the phenomenon. Knowing what situation of life he is
            about to be thrown into, they perceive in the man, who, like Hazael, says,
            "is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing?"<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> the foul
            and ferocious murderer. A man of this contemplative character partakes, in some
            degree, of the entertainment of the Gods, who were supposed to look down upon
            this world and the inhabitants of it, as we do upon a theatrical exhibition; and
            if he is of a benevolent disposition, a good man struggling with, and triumphing
            over adversity, will be to him, also, the most delightful spectacle. But though
            this eagerness to observe their fellow-creatures in every situation, leads not
            the generality of mankind to reason and reflect; and those strokes of nature
            which they are so ready to remark, stand single and unconnected in their minds,
            yet they may be easily induced to do both: and there is no mode of instruction
            which they will so eagerly pursue, as that which lays open before them, in a
            more</p>

            all, to be well exercised in this study will fit a man more particularly for the
            most important situations of life. He will prove for it the better Judge, the
            better Magistrate, the better Advocate; and as a ruler or conductor of other
            men, under every occurring circumstance, he will find himself the better enabled
            to fulfil his duty, and accomplish his designs. He will perceive the natural
            effect of every order that he issues upon the minds of his soldiers, his
            subjects, or his followers; and he will deal to others judgment tempered with
            mercy; that is to say truly just; for justice appears to us severe only when it
            is imperfect.

            this sympathetick propensity of our nature, and have attended to it in others,
            their works have been interesting and instructive. They have struck the
            imagination more forcibly, convinced the understanding more clearly, and more
            lastingly impressed the memory. If unseasoned with any reference to this, the
            fairy bowers of the poet, with all his gay images of delight, will be admired
            and forgotten; the important relations of the historian, and even the reasonings

            ostensible policy. A judicious selection of those circumstances which
            characterize the spirit of an associated mob, paltry and ludicrous as some of
            them may appear, will oftentimes convey to our minds a clearer idea why certain
            laws and privileges were demanded and agreed to, than a methodical explanation
            of their causes. A historian who has examined human nature himself, and likewise
            attends to the pleasure which developing and tracing it, does ever convey to
            others, will employ our understanding as well as our memory with his pages; and
            if this is not done, he will impose upon the latter a very difficult task, in
            retaining what she is concerned with alone.

            never presented, and yet have pleased and interested us, let it not be imputed
            to the dulness of man in discerning what is genuinely natural in himself. There
            are many inclinations belonging to us, besides this great master-propensity of

            aliment. Yet we can never so far forget it, but that we will cling to, and
            acknowledge it again, whenever it is presented before us. In a work abounding

            where it is to be discovered by stronger and more unequivocal marks, will ever
            be the most popular. For though great pains have been taken in our higher
            sentimental novels to interest us in the delicacies, embarrassments, and
            artificial distresses of the more refined part of society, they have never been
            able to cope in the publick opinion with these. The one is a dressed and
            beautiful pleasure-ground, in which we are enchanted for a while, amongst the
            delicate and unknown plants of artful cultivation; the other is a rough forest
            of our native land; the oak, the elm, the hazle, and the bramble are there; and
            amidst the endless varieties of its paths we can wander for ever. Into whatever
            scenes the novelist may conduct us, what objects soever he may present to our
            view, still is our attention most sensibly awake to every touch faithful to

         <p>The fair field of what is properly called poetry, is enriched with so many

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 21]</p><p class="pnoindent">allegory and description, can remember the plain order of things
            in this every-day world? From heroes whose majestick forms rise like a lofty
            tower, whose eyes are lightening, whose arms are irresistible, whose course is
            like the storms of heaven, bold and exalted sentiments we will readily receive;
            and will not examine them very accurately by that rule of nature which our own
            breast prescribes to us. A shepherd whose sheep, with fleeces of the purest
            snow, browze the flowery herbage of the most beautiful vallies; whose flute is
            ever melodious, and whose shepherdess is ever crowned with roses; whose every
            care is love, will not be called very strictly to account for the loftiness and
            refinement of his thoughts. The fair Nymph, who sighs out her sorrows to the
            conscious and compassionate wilds; whose eyes gleam like the bright drops of
            heaven; whose loose tresses stream to the breeze, may say what she pleases with
            impunity. I will venture, however, to say, that amidst all this decoration and
            ornament, all this loftiness and refinement, let one simple trait of the human
            heart, one expression of passion genuine and true to nature, be introduced, and
            it will stand forth alone in the boldness of reality, whilst the false and
            unnatural around it, fades away upon every side, like the rising exhalations of
            the morning. With admiration, and often with enthusiasm we proceed on </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 22]</p><p class="pnoindent">our way through the grand and the beautiful images, raised to our imagination
            by the lofty Epic muse; but what even here are those things that strike upon the
            heart; that we feel and remember? Neither the descriptions of war, the sound of
            the trumpet, the clanging of arms, the combat of heroes, nor the death of the
            mighty, will interest our minds like the fall of the feeble stranger, who simply
            expresses the anguish of his soul, at the thoughts of that far-distant home
            which he must never return to again, and closes his eyes amongst the ignoble and
            forgotten; like the timid stripling goaded by the shame of reproach, who urges
            his trembling steps to the fight, and falls like a tender flower before the
            first blast of winter. How often will some simple picture of this kind be all
            that remains upon our minds of the terrifick and magnificent battle, whose
            description we have read with admiration! How comes it that we relish so much
            the episodes of an heroick poem? It cannot merely be that we are pleased with a
            resting-place, where we enjoy the variety of contrast; for were the poem of the
            simple and familiar kind, and an episode after the heroick style introduced into
            it, ninety readers out of an hundred would pass over it altogether. Is it not
            that we meet such a story, so situated, with a kind of sympathetick good will,
            as in passing through a country of castles</p>
            <hr></hr>

            pop unawares upon some humble cottage, resembling the dwellings of our own
            native land, and gaze upon it with affection. The highest pleasures we receive
            from poetry, as well as from the real objects which surround us in the world,
            are derived from the sympathetick interest we all take in beings like ourselves;
            and I will even venture to say, that were the grandest scenes which can enter
            into the imagination of man, presented to our view, and all reference to man
            completely shut out from our thoughts, the objects that composed it would convey
            to our minds little better than dry ideas of magnitude, colour, and form; and
            the remembrance of them would rest upon our minds like the measurement and
            distances of the planets.

         <p>If the study of human nature then, is so useful to the poet, the novelist, the
            historian, and the philosopher, of how much greater importance must it be to the
            dramatick writer? To them it is a powerful auxiliary, to him it is the centre
            and strength of the battle. If characteristick views of human nature enliven not
            their pages, there are many excellencies with which they can, in some degree,
            make up for the deficiency, it is what we receive from them with pleasure rather
            than demand. But in his works no richness of invention, harmony of language, nor
            grandeur of </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 24]</p><p class="pnoindent"> sentiment will supply the place of faithfully
            delineated nature. The poet and the novelist may represent to you their great
            characters from the cradle to the tomb. They may represent them in any mood or
            temper, and under the influence of any passion which they see proper, without
            being obliged to put words into their mouths, those great betrayers of the
            feigned and adopted. They may relate every circumstance however trifling and
            minute, that serves to develop their tempers and dispositions. They tell us what
            kind of people they intend their men and women to be, and as such we receive
            them. If they are to move us with any scene of distress, every circumstance
            regarding the parties concerned in it, how they looked, how they moved, how they
            sighed, how the tears gushed from their eyes, how the very light and shadow fell
            upon them, is carefully described, and the few things that are given them to say
            along with all this assistance, must be very unnatural indeed if we refuse to
            sympathize with them. But the characters of the drama must speak directly for
            themselves. Under the influence of every passion, humour, and impression; in the
            artificial veilings of hypocrisy and ceremony, in the openness of freedom and
            confidence, and in the lonely hour of meditation they speak. He who made us hath
            placed within our breast a judge that judges </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 25]</p><p class="pnoindent"> instantaneously of
            every thing they say. We expect to find them creatures like ourselves; and if
            they are untrue to nature, we feel that we are imposed upon; as though the poet
            had introduced to us for brethren, creatures of a different race, beings of
            another world.
         </p>
         <p>As in other works deficiency in characteristick truth may be compensated by
            excellencies of a different kind, in the drama characteristick truth will
            compensate every other defect. Nay, it will do what appears a contradiction; one
            strong genuine stroke of nature will cover a multitude of sins even against
            nature herself. When we meet in some scene of good play a very fine stroke of
            this kind, we are apt to become so intoxicated with it, and so perfectly
            convinced of the author's great knowledge of the human heart, that we are
            unwilling to suppose that the whole of it has not been suggested by the same
            penetrating spirit. Many well-meaning enthusiastick criticks have given
            themselves a great deal of trouble in this way; and have shut their eyes most
            ingeniously against the fair light of nature for the very love of it. They have
            converted, in their great zeal, sentiments palpably false, both in regard to the
            character and situation of the persons who utter them, sentiments which a child
            or a clown would detect, into the most skilful depictments of the heart. I can

            Savages will, in the wild contortions of a dance, shape out some rude story
            expressive of character or passion, and such a dance will give more delight to
            his companions than the most artful exertions of agility. Children in their
            gambols will make out a mimick representation of the manners, characters, and
            passions of grown men and women, and such a pastime will animate and delight
            them much more than a treat of the daintiest sweetmeats, or the handling of the
            gaudiest toys. Eagerly as it is enjoyed by the rude and the young, to the

            struggling with those difficulties, and braving those dangers, of which they
            have heard with admiration, and the effects of which they still, perhaps,

            belonging to them, we start upon it like a discovery. They are made known to us
            in history only, by the great events they are connected with, and the part they
            have taken in extraordinary or important transactions. Even in poetry and
            romance, with the exception of some love story interwoven with the main events
            of their lives, they are seldom more intimately made known to us. To Tragedy it

            dramas to which they have ever looked back with admiration, they have been
            tempted to prefer the embellishments of poetry to faithfully delineated nature.
            They have been more occupied in considering the works of the great Dramatists
            who have gone before them, and the effects produced by their writings, than the
            varieties of human character which first furnished materials for those works, or
            those principles in the mind of man by means of which such effects were
            produced. Neglecting the boundless variety of nature, certain strong outlines of
            character, certain bold features of passion, certain grand vicissitudes, and
            striking dramatick situations have been repeated from one generation to another;
            whilst a pompous and solemn gravity, which they have supposed to be necessary
            for the dignity of tragedy, has excluded almost entirely from their works those
            smaller touches of nature, which so well develope the mind; and by showing men
            in their hours of state and exertion only, they have consequently shewn them
            imperfectly. Thus, great and magnanimous heroes, who bear with majestick
            equanimity every vicissitude of fortune; who in every temptation and trial stand

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 37]</p><p class="pnoindent"> in common with many other compositions, they
            have very much neglected those that are peculiarly her own. As far as they have
            been led aside from the first labours of a tragick poet by a desire to
            communicate more perfect moral instruction, their motive has been respectable,
            and they merit our esteem. But this praise-worthy end has been injured instead
            of promoted by their mode of pursuing it. Every species of moral writing has its
            own way of conveying instruction, which it can never, but with disadvantage,
            exchange for any other. The Drama improves us by the knowledge we acquire of our
            own minds, from the natural desire we have to look into the thoughts, and
            observe the behaviour of others. Tragedy brings to our view men placed in those
            elevated situations, exposed to those great trials, and engaged in those
            extraordinary transactions, in which few of us are called upon to act. As
            examples applicable to ourselves, therefore, they can but feebly effect us; it
            is only from the enlargement of our ideas in regard to human nature, from that
            admiration of virtue, and abhorrence of vice which they excite, that we can
            expect to be improved by them. But if they are not represented to us as real and
            natural characters, the lessons we are taught from their conduct and their
            sentiments will be no more to us than those which we receive from the pages of
            the poet or the moralist.

         <hr></hr>
         <p class="pageNumber">[Page 38]</p>
         <p>But the last part of the task which I have mentioned as peculiarly belonging to
            tragedy, unveiling the human mind under the dominion of those strong and fixed
            passions, which seemingly unprovoked by outward circumstances, will from small
            beginnings brood within the breast, till all the better dispositions, all the
            fair gifts of nature are borne down before them, her poets in general have
            entirely neglected, and even her first and greatest have but imperfectly
            attempted. They have made use of the passions to mark their several characters,
            and animate their scenes, rather than to open to our view the nature and
            portraitures of those great disturbers of the human breast, with whom we are
            all, more or less, called upon to contend. With their strong and obvious
            features, therefore, they have been presented to us, stripped almost entirely of
            those less obtrusive, but not less discriminating traits, which mark them in
            their actual operation. To trace them in their rise and progress in the heart,
            seems but rarely to have been the object of any dramatist. We commonly find the
            characters of a tragedy affected by the passions in a transient, loose,
            unconnected manner; or if they are represented as under the permanent influence
            of the more powerful ones, they are generally introduced to our notice in the
            very height of their fury, when all that timidity, irresolution, distrust, and a
            thou-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 39]</p><p class="pnoindent">sand delicate traits, which make the infancy of every great
            passion more interesting, perhaps, than its full-blown strength, are fled. The
            impassioned character is generally brought into view under those irresistible
            attacks of their power, which it is impossible to repell; whilst those gradual
            steps that lead him into this state, in some of which a stand might have been
            made against the foe, are left entirely in the shade. These passions that may be
            suddenly excited, and are of short duration, as anger, fear, and oftentimes
            jealousy, may in this manner be fully represented; but those great masters of
            the soul, ambition, hatred, love, every passion that is permanent in its nature,
            and varied in progress, if represented to us but in one stage of its course, is
            represented imperfectly. It is a characteristick of the more powerful passions
            that they will encrease and nourish themselves on very slender aliment; it is
            from within that they are chiefly supplied with what they feed on; and it is in
            contending with opposite passions and affections of the mind that we least
            discover their strength, not with events. But in tragedy it is events more
            frequently than opposite affections which are opposed to them; and those often
            of such force and magnitude that the passions themselves are almost obscured by
            the splendour and importance of the transactions to which they are attached. But
            besides being thus confined and</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 40]</p><p class="pnoindent">mutilated, the passions have been, in
            the greater part of our tragedies, deprived of the very power of making
            themselves known. Bold and figurative language belongs peculiarly to them.
            Poets, admiring those bold expressions which a mind, labouring with ideas too
            strong to be conveyed in the ordinary forms of speech, wildly throws out, taking
            earth, sea, and sky, every thing great and terrible in nature to image forth the
            violence of its feelings, borrowed them gladly, to adorn the calm sentiments of
            their premeditated song. It has therefore been thought that the less animated
            parts of tragedy might be so embellished and enriched. In doing this, however,
            the passions have been robbed of their native prerogative; and in adorning with
            their strong figures and lofty expressions the calm speeches of the unruffled,
            it is found that, when they are called upon to raise their voice, the power of
            distinguishing themselves has been taken away. This is an injury by no means
            compensated, but very greatly aggravated by embellishing, in return, the
            speeches of passion with the ingenious conceits, and compleat similies of
            premeditated thought.<span class="sup"><a href="#12" id="back12"><sup>12</sup></a> </span> There are many other things</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 41]</p><p class="pnoindent">regarding the
            manner in which dramatick poets have generally brought forward the passions in
            tragedy, to the great prejudice of that effect they are naturally fitted to
            produce upon the mind, which I forbear to mention, lest they should too much
            increase the length of this discourse; and leave an impression on the mind of my
            reader, that I write more on the spirit of criticism, than becomes one who is
            about to bring before the publick a work, with, doubtless, many faults and
            imperfections on its head. 
         </p>
         <p>From this general view, which I have endeavoured to communicate to my reader, of
            tragedy, and those principles in the human mind upon which the success of her
            efforts depends, I have been led to believe, that an attempt to write a series
            of tragedies, of simpler construction, less embellished with poetical
            decorations, less constrained by that lofty seriousness which has so generally
            been considered as necessary for the support of tragick dignity, and in which
            the chief object should be to delineate the progress of the higher passions in
            the human breast, each play exhibiting a particular passion, might not be
            unacceptable to the publick. And I have been the more readily induced to act
            upon this idea, because I am confident, that tragedy, written upon </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 42]</p><p class="pnoindent">
            this plan, is fitted to produce stronger moral effect than upon any other. I
            have said that tragedy in representing to us great characters struggling with
            difficulties, and placed in situations of eminence and danger, in which few of
            us have any chance of being called upon to act, conveys its moral efficacy to
            our minds by the enlarged views which it gives to us of human nature, by the
            admiration of virtues, and execration of vice which it excites, and not by the
            examples it holds up for our immediate application. But in opening to us the
            heart of man under the influence of those passions to which all are liable, this
            is not the case. Those strong passions that, with small assistance from outward
            circumstances, work their way in the heart, till they become the tyrannical
            masters of it, carry on a similar operation in the breast of the Monarch, and
            the man of low degree. It exhibits to us the mind of man in that state when we
            are most curious to look into it, and is equally interesting to all.
            Discrimination of character is a turn of mind, tho' more common than we are
            aware of, which every body does not possess; but to the expressions of passion,
            particularly strong passion, the dullest mind is awake; and its true
            unsophisticated language the dullest understanding will not misinterpret. To
            hold up for our example those peculiarities in disposition, and modes of
            thinking which nature has fixed upon us, on which</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 43]</p><p class="pnoindent">long and early
            habit has incorporated with our original selves, is almost desiring us to remove
            the everlasting mountains, to take away the native land-marks of the soul; but
            representing the passions brings before us the operation of a tempest that rages
            out its time and and passes away. We cannot, it is true, amidst its wild uproar,
            listen to the voice of reason, and save ourselves from destruction; but we can
            foresee it coming, we can mark its rising signs, we can know the situations that
            will most expose us to its rage, and we can shelter our heads from the coming
            blast. To change a certain disposition of mind which makes us view objects in a
            particular light, and thereby, oftentimes, unknown to ourselves, influences our
            conduct and manners, is almost impossible; but in checking and subduing those
            visitations of the soul, whose causes and effects we are aware of, every one may
            make considerable progress, if he proves not entirely successful. Above all,
            looking back to the first rise, and tracing the progress of passion, points out
            to us those stages in the approach of the enemy, when he might have been
            combated most successfully; and where the suffering him to pass may be
            considered as occasioning all the misery that ensues.

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 44]</p><p class="pnoindent">dities which a near and familiar view of them discovers. It is her
            task to exhibit them engaged in the busy turmoil of ordinary life, harassing and
            perplexing themselves with the endless pursuits of avarice, vanity, and
            pleasure; and engaged with those smaller trials of the mind, by which men are
            most apt to be overcome, and from which he, who could have supported with honour
            the attack of greater occasions, will oftentimes come off most shamefully
            foiled. It belongs to her to shew the varied fashions and manners of the world,
            as, from the spirit of vanity, caprice, and imitation, they go on in swift and
            endless succession; and those disagreeable or absurd peculiarities attached to
            particular classes and conditions in society. It is for her also to represent
            men under the influence of the stronger passions; and to trace the rise and
            progress of them in the heart, in such situations, and attended with such
            circumstances as take off their sublimity, and the interest we naturally take in
            a perturbed mind. It is hers to exhibit those terrible tyrants of the soul,
            whose ungovernable rage has struck us so often with dismay, like wild beasts
            tied to a post, who growl and paw before us, for our derision and sport. In
            pourtraying the characters of men she has this advantage over tragedy, that the
            smallest traits of nature, with the smallest circumstances which serve to bring
            them forth, may by her be displayed, however ludicrous</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 45]</p><p class="pnoindent">and trivial in
            themselves, without any ceremony. And in developing the passions she enjoys a
            similar advantage; for they often most strongly betray themselves when touched
            by those small and familiar occurrences which cannot, consistently with the

         <p>As tragedy has been very much cramped in her endeavours to exalt and improve the
            mind, by that spirit of imitation and confinement in her successive writers,
            which the beauty of her earliest poets first gave rise to, so comedy has been
            led aside from her best purposes by a different temptation. Those endless
            changes in fashions and in manners, which offer such obvious and ever-new
            subjects of ridicule; that infinite variety of tricks and manœuvers by
            which the ludicrous may be produced, and curiosity and laughter excited : the
            admiration we so generally bestow upon satirical remark, pointed repartee, and
            whimsical combinations of ideas, have too often led her to forget the warmer
            interest we feel, and the more profitable lessons we receive from genuine
            representations of nature. The most interesting and instructive class of comedy,
            therefore, the real characteristick, has been very much neglected, whilst
            satirical, witty, sentimental, and, above all, busy or circumstantial comedy
            have usurped the ex-</p>

         <p>In Satirical Comedy, sarcastick and severe reflections on the actions and manners
            of men, introduced with neatness, force, and poignancy of expression into a
            lively and well supported dialogue, of whose gay surface they are the embossed
            ornaments, make the most important and studied part of the work : Character is a
            thing talked of rather than shewn. The persons of the drama are indebted for the
            discovery of their peculiarities to what is said to them, rather than to any
            thing they are made to say or do for themselves. Much incident being
            unfavourable for studied and elegant dialogue, the plot is commonly simple, and
            the few events that compose it neither interesting nor striking. It only affords
            us that kind of moral instruction which an essay or a poem could as well have
            conveyed, and, though amusing in the closet, is but feebly attractive in the
            Theatre.<span class="sup"><a href="#13" id="back13"><sup>13</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p>In what I have termed Witty Comedy, every thing is light, playful, and easy.

            dance upon the surface of that stream, whose shallow currents sparkle in
            perpetual sun-beams, and cast up their bubbles to the light. Two or three
            persons of quick thought, and whimsical fancy, who perceive instantaneously the
            various connections of every passing idea, and the significations, natural or
            artificial, which single expressions, or particular forms of speech can possibly
            convey, take the lead thro' the whole, and seem to communicate their own
            peculiar talent to every creature in the play. The plot is most commonly feeble
            rather than simple, the incidents being numerous enough, but seldom striking or
            varied. To amuse, and only to amuse, is its aim: it pretends not to interest nor
            instruct. It pleases when we read, more than when we see it represented; and
            pleases still more when we take it up by accident, and read but a scene at a
            time.

         <p>Sentimental Comedy treats of those embarrassments, difficulties, and scruples,
            which, though sufficiently distressing to the delicate minds who entertain them,
            are not powerful enough to gratify the sympathetick desire we all feel to look
            into the heart of man in difficult and trying situations, which is the sound
            basis of tragedy, and are destitute of that seasoning of the lively and
            ludicrous, which prevents the ordinary transactions of comedy from becoming
            insipid. In real life, those who, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 48]</p><p class="pnoindent"> from the peculiar frame of their
            minds, feel most of this refined distress, are not generally communicative upon
            the subject; and those who do feel and talk about it at the same time, if any
            such there be, seldom find their friends much inclined to listen to them. It is
            not to be supposed, then, long conversations upon the stage about small
            sentimental niceties, can be generally interesting. I am afraid plays of this
            kind, as well as works of a similar nature, in other departments of literature,
            have only tended to encrease amongst us a set of sentimental hypocrites; who are
            the same persons of this age that would have been the religious ones of another;
            and are daily doing morality the same kind of injury, by substituting the
            particular excellence which they pretend to possess, for plain simple
            uprightness and rectitude.

         <p>In Busy or Circumstantial Comedy, all those ingenious contrivances of lovers,
            guardians, governantes and chamber-maids; that ambushed bushfighting amongst
            closets, screens, chests, easy-chairs, and toilet-tables, form a gay varied game
            of dexterity and invention; which, to those who have played at hide-and-seek,
            who have crouched down, with beating heart, in a dark corner, whilst the enemy
            groped near the spot; who have joined their busy school-mates in many deep-laid
            plan to deceive, perplex, and torment the unhappy mortals deputed to have the
            charge of them, cannot be </p>

            hunter, who pricks up ears at the sound of the chace, and starts away from the
            path of his journey, so, leaving all wisdom and criticism behind us, we follow
            the varied changes of the plot, and stop not for reflection. The studious man
            who wants a cessation from thought, the indolent man who dislikes it, and all
            those who, from habit or circumstances, live in a state of divorce from their
            own minds, are pleased with an amusement in which they have nothing to do but to
            open their eyes and behold; the moral tendency of it, however, is very faulty.
            That mockery of age and domestick authority, so constantly held forth, has a
            very bad effect upon the younger part of an audience; and that continual lying
            and deceit in the first characters of the piece, which is necessary for
            conducting the plot, has a most pernicious one.

            women in which we live, under those circumstances of ordinary and familiar life
            most favourable for the discovery of the human heart, offers to us a wide field
            of instruction, adapted to general application. We find in its varied scenes an
            exercise of the mind analogous to that which we all, less or more, find out for

            those of nature and not situation, they are judged of by all ranks of men; for a

            peculiarities which belong to him as a man, though he is entirely at a loss in
            all that regards his manners and address as a nobleman. It illustrates to us the

            plot, extraordinary incidents, witty repartee, or studied sentiments. It
            naturally produces for itself all that it requires; characters who are to speak
            for themselves, who are to be known by their own words and actions, not by the
            accounts that are given of them by others, cannot well be developed without
            considerable variety of judicious incident; a smile that is raised by some trait
            of undisguised nature, and a laugh that is provoked by some ludicrous effect of
            passion, or clashing of opposite characters, will be more pleasing to the
            generality of men, than either the one or the other when occasioned by a play
            upon words, or a whimsical combination of ideas; and to behold the operation and
            effects of the different propensities and weaknesses of men, will naturally call

            It is much to be regretted, however, that the eternal introduction of love as
            the grand business of the Drama, and the consequent necessity for making the
            chief persons in it such, in regard to age, appearance, manners, dispositions,
            and endowments, as are proper for interesting lovers, has occasioned so much
            insipid similarity in the higher characters. It is chiefly, therefore, on the
            second and inferiour characters, that the efforts, even of our best poets, have
            been exhausted; and thus we are called upon to be interested in the fortune of
            one man, whilst our chief attention is directed to the character of another,
            which produces a disunion of ideas in the mind, injurious to the general effect
            of the whole. From this cause, also, those characteristick varieties have been
            very much neglected, which men present to us in the middle stages of life; when
            they are too old for lovers or the confidents of lovers, and too young to be the
            fathers, uncles, and guardians, who are contrasted with them; but when the are
            still in full vigour of mind, eagerly engaged with the world, joining the
            activity of youth to the providence of age, and offer to our attention objects

            harmonious shades of it, which nature so beautifully varies, and which we so
            greatly delight in, whenever we clearly distinguish them. It is to be regretted
            that in place of those characters, which present themselves to the imagination
            of a writer from his general observations upon mankind, inferiour poets have so
            often pourtrayed with senseless minuteness the characters of particular
            individuals. We are pleased with the eccentricities of individuals in real life,
            and also in history or biography, but in fictitious writings, we regard them
            with suspicion; and no representation of nature, that corresponds not with some
            of our general ideas in regard to it, will either instruct or inform us. When
            the originals of such characters are known and remembered, the plays in which
            they are introduced are oftentimes popular; and their temporary success has
            induced a still inferiour class of poets to believe, that, by making men
            strange, and unlike the rest of the world, they have made great discoveries and
            mightily enlarged the boundaries of dramatick character. They will, therefore,
            distinguish one man from another by some strange whim or imagination, which is
            ever uppermost in his thoughts, and influences every action of his life; by some
            singular opinion, perhaps, about politicks, fashions, or the position of the
            stars; by some strong unaccountable love for </p>

            from another; entirely forgetting, that such singularities, if they are to be
            found in nature, can no where be sought for, with such probability of success,
            as in Bedlam. Above all it is to be regretted that those
            adventitious distinctions amongst men, of age, fortune, rank, profession, and
            country, are so often brought forward in preference to the great original
            distinctions of nature; and our scenes so often filled with courtiers, lawyers,
            citizens, Frenchmen, &amp;c. &amp;c. With all the characteristicks of their
            respective conditions, such as they have been represented from time immemorial.
            This has introduced a great sameness into many of our plays, which all the
            changes of new fashions burlesqued, and new customs turned into ridicule, cannot
            conceal.

         <p>In comedy, the stronger passions, love excepted, are seldom introduced but in a
            passing way. We have short bursts of anger, fits of jealousy and impatience;
            violent passion of any continuance we seldom find. When this is attempted,
            however, forgetting that mode of exposing the weakness of the human mind, which
            peculiarly belongs to her, it is too frequently done in the serious spirit of
            tragedy; and this has produced so many of those serious comick plays, which so

            There are to be found, no doubt, in the works of our best dramatick writers,
            comick scenes descriptive of the stronger passions, but it is generally the
            inferiour characters of the piece who are made the subjects of them, very rarely
            those in whom we are much interested; and consequently the useful effect of such
            scenes upon the mind is very much weakened. This general appropriation of them
            has tempted our less-skilful Dramatists to exaggerate, and step, in further
            quest of the ludicrous, so much beyond the bounds of nature, that the very
            effect they are so anxious to produce is thereby destroyed, and all useful
            application of it entirely cut off; for we never apply to ourselves a false
            representation of nature.

         <p>But a complete exhibition of passion, with its varieties and progress in the
            breast of man has, I believe, scarcely ever been attempted in comedy. Even love,
            though the chief subject of almost every play, has been pourtrayed in a loose,
            scattered, and imperfect manner. The story of the lovers is acted over before
            us, whilst the characteristicks of that passion by which they are actuated, and
            which is the great master-spring of the whole, are faintly to be discovered. We

            happy. To overcome these difficulties, he is engaged in a busy train of
            contrivance and exertion, in which the spirit, activity and ingenuity of the man
            is held forth to view, whilst the lover, comparatively speaking, is kept out of
            sight. But even when this is not the case; when the lover is not so busied and
            involved, this stage of the passion is exactly the one that is least
            interesting, and least instructive: not to mention as I have done already, that
            one stage of any passion must shew it imperfectly.

         <p>From this view of the Comick Drama I have been induced to believe, that, as
            companions to the forementioned tragedies, a series of comedies on a similar
            plan, in which bustle of plot, brilliancy of dialogue, and even the bold and
            striking in character, should, to the best of the authour's judgment, be
            kept in due subordination to nature, might likewise be acceptable to the
            publick. I am confident that comedy upon this plan is capable of being made as
            interesting, as entertaining, and superiour in the moral tendency to any other.
            For even in ordinary life, with very slight cause to excite them, strong
            passions will foster </p>

            the evils which vanity, folly, prejudice, or peculiarity of temper lead to,
            compared with those which such unquiet inmates produce? Were they confined to
            the exalted and the mighty, to those engaged in the great events of the world,
            to the inhabitants of palaces and camps, how happy comparatively would this
            world be! But many a miserable being, whom firm principle, timidity of
            character, or the fear of shame keeps back from the actual commission of crimes,
            is tormented in obscurity, under the dominion of those passions which set the
            seducer in ambush, rouse the bold spoiler to wrong, and strengthen the arm of
            the murderer. Though to those with whom such dangerous enemies have long found
            shelter, exposing them in an absurd and ridiculous light, may be shooting a
            finely-pointed arrow against the hardened rock; yet to those with whom they are
            but new, and less assured guests, this may prove a more successful mode of
            attack than any other.

         <p>It was the saying of a sagacious Scotchman,<span class="sup"><a href="#15" id="back15"><sup>15</sup></a> </span> 'let who will
            make the laws of a nation, if I have the writing of its ballads.' Something
            similar to this may be said in regard to the Drama. Its lessons reach not,
            indeed, to the lowest classes of labouring people, who are the broad foundation
            of society, which can never be gene- </p>

            endangering everything that is constructed upon it, and who are our potent and
            formidable ballad readers; but they reach to the classes next in order to them,
            and who will always have over them no inconsiderable influence. The impressions
            made by it are communicated, at the same instant of time, to a greater number of
            individuals, than those made by any other species of writing; and they are
            strengthened in every spectator, by observing their effects upon those who
            surround him. From this observation, the mind of my reader will suggest of
            itself, what it would be unnecessary, and, perhaps, improper in me here to
            enlarge upon. The theatre is a school in which much good or evil may be learned.
            At the beginning of its career the Drama was employed to mislead and excite; and
            were I not unwilling to refer to transactions of the present times, I might
            abundantly confirm what I have said by recent examples. The authour, therefore,
            who aims in any degree to improve the mode of its instruction, and point to more
            useful lessons than it is generally employed to dispense, is certainly
            praiseworthy, though want of abilities may unhappily prevent him from being
            successful at his efforts. 
         </p>
         <p>This idea has prompted me to begin a work in which I am aware of many
            difficulties. In plays of this nature the passions must be depicted </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 59]</p><p class="pnoindent">
            not only with their bold and prominent features, but also with those minute and
            delicate traits which distinguish them in an infant, growing, and repressed
            state; which are the most difficult of all to counterfeit, and one of which
            falsely imagined, will destroy the effect of a whole scene. The characters over
            whom they are made to usurp dominion, must be powerful and interesting,
            exercising them with their full measure of opposition and struggle; for the
            chief antagonists they contend with must be the other passions and propensities
            of the heart, not outward circumstances and events. Though belonging to such
            characters, they must still be held to view in their most baleful and
            unseductive light; and those qualities in the impassioned which are necessary to
            interest us in their fate, must not be allowed, by any lustre borrowed from
            them, to diminish our abhorrence of guilt. The second and even the inferiour
            persons to each play, as they must be kept perfectly distinct from the great
            impassioned one, should generally be represented in a calm unagitated state, and
            therefore more pains is necessary than in other dramatick works, to mark them by
            appropriate distinctions of character, lest they should appear altogether
            insipid and insignificant. As the great object here is to trace passion through
            all its varieties, and in every stage, many of which are marked </p>

            shades so delicate, that in much bustle of events they would be little attended
            to, or entirely overlooked, simplicity of plot is more necessary, than in those
            plays where only occasional bursts of passion are introduced, to distinguish a
            character, or animate a scene. But where simplicity of plot is necessary, there
            is a very great danger of making a piece appear bare and unvaried, and nothing
            but great force and truth in the delineations of nature will prevent it from
            being tiresome.<span class="sup"><a href="#16" id="back16"><sup>16</sup></a> </span> Soliloquy, or those overflowings of the </p>

            perturbed soul, in which it unburthens itself of those thoughts which it cannot
            communicate to others, and which in certain situations is the only mode that a
            Dramatist can employ to open us to the mind he would display, must necessarily
            be often, and to considerable length, introduced. Here, indeed, as it naturally
            belongs to passion, it will not be so offensive as it generally is in other
            plays, when a calm unagitated person tells over to himself all that has befallen
            him, and all his future schemes of intrigue or advancement; yet to make speeches
            of this kind sufficiently natural and impressive, to excite no degree of
            weariness nor distaste, will be found to be no easy task. There are, besides
            these, many other difficulties peculiarly belonging to this undertaking, too
            minute and tedious to mention. If, fully aware of them, I have not shrunk back
            from the attempt, it is not from any idea that my own powers or discernment will
            at all times enable me to overcome them; but I am emboldened by the confidence I
            feel in that candour and indulgence, with which the good and enlightened do ever
            regard the experimental efforts of those, who wish in any degree to enlarge the
            sources of pleasure and instruction amongst men.

         <p>It will now be proper to say something of the particular plays which compose this
            volume. But, in the first place I must observe, that as I pretend </p>

            not to have overcome the difficulties attached to this design, so neither from
            the errours and defects, which, in these pages, I have thought it necessary to
            point out in the works of others, do I at all pretend to be blameless. To
            conceive the great moral object and outline of a story; to people it with
            various characters, under the influence of various passions; and to strike out
            circumstances and situations calculated to call them into action, is a very
            different employment of the mind from calmly considering those propensities of
            our nature, to which dramatick writings are most powerfully addressed, and
            taking a general view upon those principles of the works of preceding authours.
            They are employments which cannot well occupy it at the same time; and
            experience has taught us, that criticks do not unfrequently write in
            contradiction to their own rules. If I should, therefore, sometimes appear in
            the foregoing remarks to have provided a stick wherewith to break mine own pate,
            I entreat that my reader will believe I am neither confident nor boastful, and
            use it with gentleness. 
         </p>
         <p>In the two first plays, where love is the passion under review, their relation to
            the general plan may not be very obvious. Love is the chief groundwork of almost
            all our tragedies and comedies, and so far they are not distinguished from
            others. But I have endeavored in both </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 63]</p><p class="pnoindent"> to give an unbroken view of
            the passion from its beginning, and to mark it as I went along, with those
            peculiar traits which distinguish its different stages of progression. I have in
            both these pieces grafted this passion not on those open communicative impetuous
            characters, who have so long occupied the dramatick station of lovers, but on
            men of a firm, thoughtful, reserved turn of mind, with whom it commonly makes
            the longest stay, and maintains the hardest struggle. I should be extremely
            sorry if, from any thing at the conclusion of the tragedy, it should be supposed
            that I mean to countenance suicide, or condemn those customs whose object is the
            discouragement of it, by withholding from the body of the self-slain those
            sacred rites, and marks of respect commonly shewn to the dead. Let it be
            considered, that whatever I have inserted there, which can at all raise any
            suspicion of this kind, is put into the mouths of rude uncultivated soldiers,
            who are roused with the loss of a beloved leader, and indignant at any idea of
            disgrace being attached to him. If it should seem inconsistent with the nature
            of this work, that in its companion the comedy, I have made strong moral
            principle triumph over love, let it be remembered, that without this the whole
            moral tendency of a play, which must end happily, would have been destroyed; and
            that it is not my intention to</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 64]</p><p class="pnoindent"> encourage the indulgence of this
            passion, amiable as it is, but to restrain it. The last play, the subject of
            which is hatred, will more clearly discover the nature and intention of my
            design. The rise and progress of this passion I have been obliged to give in
            retrospect, instead of representing it all along in its actual operation, as I
            could have wished to have done. But hatred is a passion of slow growth; and to
            have exhibited it from its beginnings would have included a longer period, than
            even those who are least scrupulous about the limitation of dramatick time,
            would have thought allowable. I could not have introduced my chief characters
            upon the stage as boys, and then as men. For this passion must be kept distinct
            from that dislike which we conceive for another when he has greatly offended us,
            and which is almost the constant companion of anger; and also from that eager
            desire to crush, and inflict suffering on him who has injured us, which
            constitutes revenge. This passion, as I have conceived it, is that rooted and
            settled aversion, which from opposition of character, aided by circumstances of
            little importance, grows at last into such antipathy and personal disgust as
            makes him who entertains it, feel, in the presence of him who is the object of
            it, a degree of torment and restlesness [<span class="italics">sic</span>] which is insufferable. It is a
            passion, I believe less frequent than any other of </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 65]</p><p class="pnoindent"> the stronger
            passions, but in the breast where it does exist, it creates, perhaps, more
            misery than any other. To endeavour to interest the mind for a man under the
            dominion of a passion so baleful, so unamiable, may seem, perhaps,
            reprehensible. I therefore beg it may be considered that it is the passion and
            not the man which is held up to our execration; and that this and every other
            bad passion does more strongly evince its pernicious and dangerous nature, when
            we see it thus counteracting and destroying the good gifts of heaven, than when
            it is represented as the suitable associate in the breast of inmates as dark as
            itself. This remark will likewise be applicable to many of the other plays
            belonging to my work, that are intended to follow. A decidedly wicked character
            can never be interesting; and to employ such for the display of any strong
            passion would very much injure instead of improving the moral effect. In the
            breast of a bad man passion has comparatively little to combat, how then can it
            shew its strength? I shall say no more upon this subject, but submit myself to
            the judgment of my reader. 
         </p>
         <p>It may, perhaps, be supposed from my publishing these plays, that I have written
            them for the closet rather than the stage. If upon perusing them with attention,
            the reader is disposed to think they are better calculated for the first than

            and not to any previous design. A play, but of small poetical merit, that is
            suited to strike and interest the spectator, to catch the attention of him who
            will not, and of him who cannot read, is a more valuable and useful production
            than one whose elegant and harmonious pages are admired in the libraries of the
            tasteful and refined. To have received approbation from an audience of my
            countrymen, would have been more pleasing to me than any other praise. A few
            tears from the simple and young would have been, in my eyes, pearls of great
            price; and the spontaneous, untutored plaudits of the rude and uncultivated
            would have come to my heart as offerings of no mean value. I should, therefore,
            have been better pleased to have introduced them to the world from the stage
            than from the press. I possess, however, no likely channel to the former mode of
            publick introduction; and upon further reflection it appeared to me that by
            publishing them in this way, I have an opportunity afforded me of explaining the
            design of my work and enabling the publick to judge, not only of each play by
            itself, but as making a part likewise of the whole; an advantage which, perhaps,
            does more than over-balance the splendour and effect of theatrical
            representation.

         <p>It may be thought that with this extensive plan before me, I should not have been
            in a hurry to publish, but have waited to give a larger portion of it to the
            publick, which would have enabled them to make a truer estimate of its merit. To
            bring forth only three plays of the whole, and the last without its intended
            companion, may seem like the haste of those vain people, who as soon as they
            have written a few pages of a discourse, or a few couplets of a poem, cannot be
            easy till every body has seen them. I do protest, in honest simplicity! it is
            distrust and not confidence, that has led me at this early stage of the
            undertaking, to bring it before the publick. To labour in uncertainty is at all
            times unpleasant; but to proceed in a long and difficult work with any
            impression upon your mind that your labour may be in vain; that the opinion you
            have conceived of your ability to perform it may be a delusion, a false
            suggestion of self-love, the fantasy of an aspiring temper, is most discouraging
            and cheerless. I have not proceeded so far, indeed, merely upon the strength of
            my own judgment; but the friends to whom I have shewn my manuscripts are partial
            to me, and their approbation which in the case of any indifferent person would
            be in my mind completely decisive, goes but a little way in relieving me from

         <p>Before I close this discourse, let me crave the forbearance of my reader, if he
            has discovered in the course of it any unacknowledged use of the thoughts of
            other authours, which he thinks ought to have been noticed; and let me beg the
            same favour, if in reading the following plays, any similar neglect seems to
            occur. There are few writers who have sufficient originality of thought to
            strike out for themselves new ideas upon every occasion. When a thought presents
            itself to me, as suited to the purpose I am aiming at, I would neither be
            thought proud enough to reject it, on finding that another has used it before
            me, nor mean enough to make use of it without acknowledging the obligation, when
            I can at all guess to whom such acknowledgments are due. But I am situated where
            I have no library to consult; my reading through the whole of my life has been
            of a loose, scattered, unmethodical kind, with no determined direction, and I
            have not been blessed by nature with the advantages of a retentive or accurate
            memory. Do not, however, imagine from this, I at all wish to insinuate that I
            ought to be acquitted of every obligation to preceding authours; and that when

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 70]</p><p class="pnoindent"> a palpable similarity of thought and expression is observable
            between us, it is a similarity produced by accident alone, and with perfect
            unconsciousness on my part. I am frequently sensible, from the manner in which
            an idea arises to my imagination, and the readiness with which words, also,
            present themselves to clothe it in, that I am only making use of some dormant
            part of that hoard of ideas which the most indifferent memories lay up, and not
            the native suggestions of mine own mind. Whenever I have suspected myself of
            doing so, in the course of this work, I have felt a strong inclination to mark
            that suspicion in a note. But, besides that it might have appeared like an
            affectation of scrupulousness which I would avoid, there being likewise, most
            assuredly, many other places in it where I have done the same thing without
            being conscious of it, a suspicion of wishing to slur them over, and claim all
            the rest as unreservedly my own, would unavoidably have attached to me. If this
            volume should appear, to any candid and liberal critick, to merit that he should
            take the trouble of pointing out to me in what parts of it I seem to have made
            use of other authours' writings, which according to the fair laws of
            literature ought to have been acknowledged, I shall think myself obliged to him.

         <p>How little credit soever, upon perusing these plays, the reader may think me
            entitled to in regard to the execution of the work, he will not, I flatter
            myself, deny me some credit in regard to the plan. I know of no series of plays,
            in any language, expressly descriptive of the different passions; and I believe
            there are few plays existing in which the display of one strong passion is the
            chief business of the drama, so written that they could properly make part of
            such a series. I do not think that we should, from the works of various
            authours, be able to make a collection which would give us any thing exactly of
            the nature of that which is here proposed. If the reader, in perusing it,
            perceives that the abilities of the authour are not proportioned to the task
            which is imposed upon them, he will wish in the spirit of kindness rather than
            of censure, as I most sincerely do, that they had been more adequate to it.
            However, if I perform it ill, I am still confident that this (pardon me if I
            call it, noble) design will not be suffered to fall to the ground; some one will
            arise after me who will do it justice; and there is no poet, possessing genius
            for such a work, who will not at the same </p>

            of justice and of candour, which will lead him to remember me with respect. 
         </p>
         <p>I have now only to thank my reader, whoever he may be, who has followed me
            through the pages of this discourse, for having had the patience to do so. May
            he, in going through what follows (a wish the sincerity of which he cannot
            doubt) find more to reward his trouble than I dare venture to promise him; and
            for the pains he has already taken, and that which he intends to take for me, I
            request that he will accept of my grateful acknowledgments. <span class="sup"><a href="#18" id="back18"><sup>18</sup></a> </span></p>

            with all the force and clearness of the most able pen. In the first let
            the most admirable exertions of military skill in the General, and the
            most unshaken courage in the soldiers, gain over an equal or superiour
            number of brave opponents a compleat and glorious victory. In the second
            let the General be less scientifick, and the soldiers less dauntless.
            Let them go into the field for a cause that is dear to them, and fight
            with the ardour which such motives inspire; till discouraged with the
            many deaths around them, and the renovated pressure of the foe, some
            unlooked-for circumstance, trifling in itself, strikes their imagination
            at once; they are visited with the terrours of nature; their national
            pride, the honour of soldiership is forgotten; they fly like a fearful
            flock. Let some beloved chief then step forth, and call upon them by the
            love of their country, by the memory of their valiant fathers, by
            everything that kindles in the bosom of man the high and generous
            passions: they stop; they gather round him; and goaded by shame and
            indignation, returning again to the charge, with the fury of wild beasts
            rather than the courage of soldiers, bear down everything before them.
            Which of these two battles will interest us the most? and which of them
            shall we remember the longest? The one will stand forth in the
            imagination of the reader like a rock of the desert, which points out to
            the far-removed traveler the country through which he has passed, when
            its lesser objects are obscured in the distance; whilst the other leaves
            no traces behind it, but in the minds of the scientifick in war [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

         <p id="6">6. It appears to me
            a very strong testimony of the excellence of <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">our great national
               Dramatist</a>, that so many people have been employed in finding
            out obscure and refined beauties, in which appear to ordinary
            observation his very defects. Men, it may be said, do so merely to shew
            their own superior penetration and ingenuity. But granting this; what
            could make other men listen to them, and listen so greedily too, if it
            were not that they have received from the works of <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</a>, pleasure
            far beyond what the most perfect poetical compositions of a different
            character can afford [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a> note]. <a href="#back6">Back</a></p>
         <p id="7">7. Though the progress of
            society would have given us the Drama, independently of the particular
            cause of its first commencement, the peculiar circumstances connected
            with its origin, have had considerable influence upon its character and
            style, in the ages through which it has passed even to our days, and
            still will continue to affect it. <a href="people.html#Homer">Homer</a> had long preceded the dramatick poets of Greece; poetry
            was in a high state of cultivation when they began to write; and their
            style, the construction of their pieces, and the characters of their
            heroes were different from what they would have been, had theatrical
            exhibitions been the invention of an earlier age or a ruder people.
            Their works were represented to an audience, already accustomed to hear
            long poems rehearsed at their publick games, and the feasts of their
            gods. A play, with the principal characters of which they were
            previously acquainted; in which their great men and heroes, in the most
            beautiful language, complained of their rigorous fate, but piously
            submitted to the will of the Gods; in which sympathy was chiefly excited
            by tender and affecting sentiments; in which strong bursts of passion
            were few; and in which whole scenes frequently passed, without giving
            the actors any thing to do but to speak, was not too insipid for them.
            Had the Drama been the invention of a less cultivated nation, more of
            action and of passion would have been introduced into it. It would have
            been  more irregular, more imperfect, more varied,
            more interesting. From poor beginnings it would have advanced in a
            progressive state; and succeeding poets, not having those polished and
            admired originals to look back upon, would have presented their
            respective contemporaries with the produce of a free and unbridled
            imagination. A different class of poets would most likely have been
            called into existence. The latent powers of men are called forth by
            contemplating those works in which they find any thing congenial to
            their own peculiar talents; and if the field, wherein they could have
            worked, is already enriched with a produce unsuited to their
            cultivation, they think not of entering it at all. Men, therefore, whose
            natural turn of mind led them to labour, to reason, to refine and exalt,
            have caught their animation from the beauties of the Grecian Drama, and
            they who, perhaps, ought only to have been our Criticks have become our
            Poets. I mean not, however, in any degree to depreciate the works of the
            ancients; a great deal we have gained by those beautiful compositions;
            and what we have lost by them it is impossible to compute. Very strong
            genius will sometimes break through every disadvantage of circumstances:
            <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</a> has
            arisen in this country, and we ought not to complain [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

         <p id="8">8. To a being
            perfectly free from all human infirmity our sympathy refuses to extend.
            Our Saviour himself, whose character is so beautiful, and so
            harmoniously consistent; in whom, with outward proofs of his mission
            less strong than those that are offered to us, I should still be
            compelled to believe, from being utterly unable to conceive how the idea
            of such a character could enter into the imagination of man, never
            touches the heart more nearly than when he says, "Father, let this
            cup pass from me." Had he been represented to us in all the
            unshaken strength of these tragick heroes, his disciples would have made
            fewer converts, and his precepts would have been listened to coldly.
            Plays in which heroes of this kind are held forth, and whose aim is,
            indeed, honourable and praise-worthy, have been admired by the
            cultivated and refined, but the tears of the simple, the applauses of
            the young and untaught have been wanting [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>
            note]. <a href="#back8">Back</a></p>
         <p id="9">9. In all burlesque imitations of tragedy,
            those plays in which this hero is pre-eminent, are always exposed to
            bear the great brunt of the ridicule; which proves how popular they have
            been, and how many poets, and good ones too, have been employed upon
            them. That they have been so popular, however, is not owing to the
            intrinsick merit of the characters they represent, but their opposition
            to those mean and contemptible qualities belonging to human nature, of
            which we are most ashamed. Besides, there is something in the human
            mind, independently of its love of applause, which inclines it to boast.
            This is ever the attendant of that elasticity of soul, which makes us
            bound up from the touch of oppression; and if there is nothing in the
            accompanying circumstances to create disgust, or suggest suspicions of
            their sincerity, (as in real life is commonly the case,) we are very apt
            to be carried along with the boasting of others. Let us in good earnest
            believe that a man is capable of achieving all that human courage can
            achieve, and we will suffer him to talk of impossibilities. Amidst all
            their pomp of words, therefore, our admiration of such heroes is readily
            excited, (for the understanding is more easily deceived than the heart,)
            but how stands our sympathy affected? As no caution nor foresight, on
            their own account, is ever suffered to occupy the thoughts of such bold
            disinterested beings, we are the more inclined to care for them, and
            take an interest in their fortune through the course of the play : yet,
            as their souls are unappalled  by any thing; as pain
            and death are not all regarded by them; and as we have seen them very
            ready to plunge their own swords into their own bosoms, on no very
            weighty occasion, perhaps, their death distresses us but little, and
            they commonly fall unwept [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a> note]. <a href="#back9">Back</a></p>
         <p id="10">10. Were it not, that in tragedies where these heroes preside, the same
            soft tones of sorrow are so often repeated in our ears, till we are
            perfectly tired of it, they are more fitted to interest us than any
            other: both because in seeing them, we own the ties of kindred between
            ourselves and the frail mortals we lament; and sympathize with the
            weakness of mortality unmixed with any thing to degrade or disgust; and
            also, because the misfortunes, which form the story of the play, are
            frequently of the more familiar and domestick kind. A king driven from
            his throne, will not move our sympathy so strongly, as a private man
            torn from the bosom of his family [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>
            note]. <a href="#back10">Back</a></p>
         <p id="11">11. I have said nothing here in regard to
            female character, though in many tragedies it is brought forward as the
            principal one of the piece, because what I have said of the above
            characters is likewise applicable to it. I believe there is no man that
            ever lived, who has behaved in a certain manner, on a certain occasion,
            who has not had amongst women some corresponding spirit, who on the like
            occasion, and every way similarly circumstanced, would have behaved in
            the like manner. With some degree of softening and refinement, each
            class of the tragick heroes I have mentioned has its corresponding one
            amongst the heroines. The tender and pathetick no doubt has the most
            numerous, but the great and magnanimous is not without it, and the
            passionate and impetuous boasts of one by no means inconsiderable in
            numbers, and drawn sometimes to the full as passionate and impetuous as
            itself [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

         <p id="12">12. This, perhaps, more
            than any thing else has injured the higher scenes of tragedy. For having
            made such free use of bold hyperbolical language in the inferior parts,
            the poet when he arrives at the highly impassioned sinks into total
            inability; or if he will force himself to rise still higher on the wing,
            he flies beyond nature altogether, into the regions of bombast and
            nonsense [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

         <p id="13">13. These plays are generally
            the work of men, whose judgment and acute observation, enable them
            admirably well to generalize, and apply to classes of men the remarks
            they have made upon individuals; yet know not how to dress up, with any
            natural congruity, an imaginary individual in the attributes they have
            assigned to those classes [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a> note]. <a href="#back13">Back</a></p>
         <p id="14">14. 
            Such plays, however excellent the parts may be of which they are
            composed, can never produce the same strength and
            unity of effect upon our minds which we receive from plays of a simpler
            undivided construction. If the serious and distressing scenes make a
            deep impression, we do not find ourselves in a humour for the comick
            ones that succeed; and if the comick scenes enliven us greatly, we feel
            tardy and unalert in bringing back our minds to a proper tone for the
            serious. As in tragedy we smile at those native traits of character, or
            that occasional sprightliness of dialogue, which are sometimes
            introduced, to animate her less-interesting parts, so may we be moved by
            comedy; but our tears should be called forth by those gentle strokes of
            nature, which come at once with kindred kindness on the heart, and are
            quickly succeeded by smiles. Like a small summer-cloud, whose rain-drops
            sparkle in the sun, and which swiftly passes away, is the genuine
            pathetick of comedy: the gathering foreseen storm, that darkens the
            whole face of the sky, belongs to tragedy alone. It is often observed, I
            confess, that we are more apt to be affected by those scenes of distress
            which we meet with in comedy, than the high-wrought woes of tragedy; and
            I believe it is true. But this arises from the woes of tragedy being so
            often appropriated to high and mighty personages, and strained beyond
            the modesty of nature, in order to suit their great dignity; or from the
            softened griefs of more gentle and familiar characters being rendered
            feeble and tiresome with too much repetition and whining. It arises from
            the greater facility with which we enter into the distresses of people,
            more upon a level with ourselves; and whose sorrows are expressed in
            less studied and unnatural language [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

            simplicity of plot, the shew and decorations of the theatre ought to be
            allowed, to plays written upon this plan, in their full extent. How
            fastidious soever some poets may be in regard to these matters, it is
            much better to relieve our tired-out attention with a battle, a banquet,
            or a procession, than an accumulation of incidents. In the latter case
            the mind is harassed and confused with those doubts, conjectures, and
            disappointments which multiplied events occasion, and in a great measure
            unfitted for attending to the worthier parts of the piece; but in the
            former it enjoys a rest, a pleasing pause in its more serious
            occupation, from which it can return again, without any incumbrance of
            foreign intruding ideas. The shew of a splendid procession will afford
            to a person of the best understanding, a pleasure in kind, though not in
            degree, with that which a child would receive from it. But when it is
            past he thinks no more of it; whereas some confusion of circumstances,
            some half-explained mistake, which gives him no pleasure at all when it
            takes place, may take off his attention afterwards from the refined
            beauties of a natural and characteristick dialogue [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

            three Gentlemen whom I have not the honour of reckoning amongst my
            friends. One of them, who is a man of distinguished talents, has
            honoured it with very flattering approbation; and, at his suggestion,
            one or two slight alterations in it have been made [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a>

            appropriate distinction to the characters of his tragedies. The remarks
            I have made, in regard to the little variety of character to be met with
            in tragedy, apply not to him. Neither has he, as other Dramatists
            generally do, bestowed pains on the chief persons of his drama only,
            leaving the second and inferiour ones insignificant and spiritless. He
            never wears out our capacity to feel, by eternally pressing upon it. His
            tragedies are agreeably chequered with variety of scenes, enriched with
            good sense, nature, and vivacity, which relieve our minds from the
            fatigue of continued distress. If he sometimes carries this so far as to
            break in upon that serious tone of mind, which disposes us to listen
            with effect to the higher scenes of tragedy, he has done so chiefly in
            his historical plays, where the distresses set forth are commonly of
            that publick kind, which does not, at any rate, make much impression
            upon the feelings [<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie's</a> note]. <a href="#back18">Back</a></p>
