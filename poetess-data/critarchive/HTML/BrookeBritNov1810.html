         <p class=""><a href="people.html#BrookeFrances"><span class="largest">F</span><span class="smcaps">rances</span> B<span class="smcaps">rooke</span></a>, whose maiden name was Moore, an elegant and accomplished
            woman, was the wife of a clergyman. She had, at one time, a share in the
            management of the Opera House. Her publications are numerous. She wrote a
            periodical paper entitled <span class="italics">The Old
               Maid</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> and some pieces
            for the theatre. She translated <span class="italics">Lady Catesby’s
               Letters</span><span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> from the French, and several other works. The
            two novels by which she is best known are <span class="italics">Emily
               Montague</span>, and <span class="italics">Lady Julia
               Mandeville</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> The latter is a simple, well
            connected story, told with elegance and strong effect. It is a forcible appeal
            to the feelings against the savage practice of duelling. <span class="italics">Emily Montague</span> is less interesting in
            the story, which serves but as a thread to connect a great deal of beautiful
            description of the manners and scenery of Canada, which country the author had
            visited. <a href="people.html#BrookeFrances">Mrs. Brooke</a> was perhaps
            the first female novel-writer who attained a perfect purity and polish of style.
            The whole is correct and easy, and many passages are highly beautiful.

         <p> What can be more animated than the description of the breaking up of the vast
            body of ice which forms what is called the <span class="italics">bridge</span>,
            from Quebec to Point Levi? "The ice before the town being five feet thick,

            attempts to force it from the banks. At length," she says, "the hour
            is come. I have been with a crowd of both sexes, and all ranks, hailing the
            propitious moment. Our situation on the top of Cape Diamond gave us a prospect
            some leagues above and below the town. Above Cape Diamond the river was open; it
            was so below Point Levi, the rapidity of the current having forced a passage for
            the water under the transparent bridge, which for more than a league continued
            firm. We stood waiting with all the eagerness of expectation; the tide came
            rushing in with amazing impetuosity; the bridge seemed to shake, yet resisted
            the force of the waters; the tide recoiled, it made a pause, it stood still, it
            returned with a redoubled fury,—the immense mass of ice gave way. A vast
            plain appeared in motion; it advanced with solemn and majestic pace; the points
            of land on the banks of the river for a few moments stopped its progress; but
            the immense weight of so prodigious a body, carried along by a rapid current,
            bore down all opposition with a force irresistible."

         <p> The manners of the Canadians are equally well described: and this lady’s account
            both of the climate and the people corresponds to the favourable impression
            which other travellers give us, both of the country and the inhabitants; the
            climate healthy and pleasant, though cold, and the inhabitants preserving so
            near the pole the gaiety and urbanity of their native France. This lady died in
            1789.
