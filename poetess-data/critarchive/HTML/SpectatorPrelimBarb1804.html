            					Whoever has lived long enough to compare one race of men with that which has
            					preceded it, will have observed a change, not only in the tastes and habitudes
            					of common life, but in the fashion of their studies, and their course of general
            					reading. Books influence manners; and manners, in return, influence the taste
            					for books.
         </p>
         <p> Books make a silent and gradual, but a sure change in our ideas and opinions;
            					and as new authors are continually taking possession of the public mind, and
            old

            					age would put <a href="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</a> into the
            					hands of his child, and the parent of the present day would give him <a href="people.html#BerquinM">Berquin</a>; each with a view of impressing
            					the same general sentiments of piety and benevolence: yet their offspring will
            					be pupils of a different school, and their moral ideas will have some shades
            of
            					difference. This new infusion of taste and moral sentiment acts in its turn upon
            					the relish for books; and thus the fame of writers is exposed to continual
            					fluctuation. Nor does this remark apply only to those ephemeral publications
            					which, either from the nature of the subject or the mediocrity of its execution,
            					live their day, and are then buried in oblivion; but to books that have been
            the
            					favourites of the public, and ‘the very glass by which its noble youth did dress

            					fashion and caprice direct the taste of the public into a different channel.
            It
            					is true, indeed, that a work of the first excellence cannot perish. It will

         <p> This revolution the Spectators, with the other sets of papers by
            					the same hands, appear to the Editor to have undergone. When those were young
            					who now are old, no books were so popular, particularly with the female sex.
            					They were the favourite volumes in a young lady's library; and probably the
            					very first that, after the Bible, she would have thought of
            					purchasing. <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de
               						Coverley</a> and the other characters of the club were ‘familiar in our

            					remained indelibly engraven on our memories. From the papers of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> we imbibed our first relish
            					for wit; from his criticisms we formed our first standard of taste; and from
            his
            					delineations we drew our first ideas of manners. It </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iv]</p><p class="pnoindent"> requires little attention to be convinced that this is now far from
            					being the case. It is not difficult to meet with those among the rising
            					generation who have only seen here and there an occasional paper of a
            					publication once so generally diffused; and it now and then happens that a story
            					from the Tatler is produced as new, in polite company, without
            					detection. Various causes have contributed to this change. When these periodical
            					papers were first published, the plan itself was new. It has since been adopted
            					by various writers with more or less success, till the frame-work is worn out,
            					or, if the reader please, till the canvas of the panorama is become threadbare.
            					Style has also been purified and refined. Criticism has become more profound.
            					Essay-writing has been largely cultivated. Moral sentiments of weight and
            					importance have become trite from frequent repetition. The talent also of
            					composition is more common than it was a century ago; and many things which were
            					then first said have since been better said. Add to this, that much of the wit
            					and lively satire of these papers has been employed on subjects of a temporary
            					nature, and has consequently lost much of its salt and pungency. We are no
            					longer interested in the </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent"> contest between the opera and the
            					puppet-show. We can only guess how much of truth and how much of invention is
            					contained in the account of the Mohawks; and we are less struck with the
            					whimsical effect of party-patching, when the mode itself is forgotten amidst
            					newer inventions of capricious ornament, and more modern exhibitions of
            					fashionable folly.
         </p>
         <p> It is also to be considered, that the more efficacious these pieces have been,
            					and no doubt they have had considerable effect, in refining the taste and
            					correcting the manners of society, the sooner will they be thrown by as
            					antiquated or useless. Thus, the very success of a book may hasten the period
            of
            					its being forgotten; and the completion of an author's purpose may turn out
            					to be the ruin of his fame. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> was himself aware of this cause of a diminution of
            					popularity, and says, in one of his essays, that those papers which attack the
            					follies of the day, will, in process of time, become like old plate; the weight
            					will remain, but the fashion will be lost. 
         </p>
         <p> It must however be acknowledged, that a great part of these compositions do by
            					no means stand upon so high a ground of merit as to have any strong claim upon
            					the notice of </p>

            					deal of absolute trifling; and the Spectators themselves, though
            					the best of the several sets, are very unequally written,—as indeed might
            					be expected from the various hands engaged in the work. <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</a> was an entertaining rather
            					than a fine writer; and none of his coadjutors (the immortal <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> alone excepted) would now
            					be thought much above the common run of essay-writers in a newspaper or a
            					magazine. Many inaccuracies and even vulgarisms blemish the pages of <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</a>, which an author of less
            					celebrity would now avoid. We are grown more accurate in our definitions, more
            					discriminating in our investigations, more pure in our diction, more fastidious
            					in the ornaments of style; we possess standards of excellence of every kind to
            					refer to, books multiply on our hands, and we willingly consign to oblivion a
            					portion of the old, to make room for the increasing demands of the new.
         </p>
         <p> This being the case, it has been thought that a <span class="italics">Selection</span> from the <span class="italics">Tatlers</span>, <span class="italics">Spectators</span>, and <span class="italics">Guardians</span>, comprising all those papers in which the

            					to possess the originals, and who, if they did, would want a guide, in so
            					miscellaneous a work, to direct them to what is best worth their notice. Let
            it
            					not be imagined that such a Selection is presumptuously intended to supersede
            					the original volumes; they must always find their place in a well-furnished
            					library: but the generality of readers, of whose various occupations the
            					cultivation of literature makes only a part, (and of this class are nearly all
            					women, and most men who are not devoted to professional studies,) may perhaps
            be
            					well content to have some of the most beautiful compositions in our language
            					presented to them, without being obliged to lose their own time in separating
            					them from a mass of uninteresting matter. The French are very fond of extracting

            					which may be translated <span class="italics">the essence of a writer</span>.
            					In this, which may be compared to the essential oils of plants, resides the
            					genuine and distinguishing flavour of an author's wit; but it commonly
            					bears a very small proportion to his bulk. Whole libraries might by this process

            					in this way. We are apt to lament the waste he has made among the productions
            of
            					antient genius: but it is probable, if we had an opportunity of inspecting them,
            					we should find that, in reality, nearly all are preserved to us that are most
            					worth preservation; and that what has perished is chiefly made up of the
            					residuum of science, and the caput mortuum of literature. It is true, indeed,
            					that there is a light in which papers that describe the manners and little
            					incidents of the day, rise in value as their contents become more obsolete. With
            					what curiosity should we peruse a Roman newspaper, or a critique upon <a href="people.html#Roscius">Roscius</a>, or a <span class="italics">conversatione</span> at the toilette of <a href="people.html#Aspasia">Aspasia</a>! To an antiquary the Spectators are already a
            					great source of information, and five hundred years hence will be invaluable;
            					though it must be observed, some discernment is necessary to separate the
            					playful exaggerations of humour from the real facts on which they are
            					grounded.

         <p> It may be proper to preface this Selection with some account of the original
            					publications. The Tatler was undertaken by sir <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Richard Steele</a>, under the
            					fictitious name of Isaac Bickerstaff; which he assumed, as he tells us </p>

            					predictions relative to poor Partridge, the almanac-maker.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> The first number was published April 12, 1709. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> was at this time in
            					Ireland, secretary to <a href="people.html#WhartonThomas">Wharton</a> the
            					lord-lieutenant. He is said to have discovered his friend when he got to the
            					sixth number, by a remark on <a href="people.html#Virgil">Virgil</a>,
            					which he recollected having communicated to him. From that time <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> enriched it with occasional
            					pieces, though he seems to have confined his assistance to loose hints and
            					sketches during the earlier period of the work. It is not till the second volume
            					that we meet with any entire paper in his best style. But the hand of <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, who then acted with the
            					whigs, and was intimate with <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</a>, is frequently discernible. The <span class="italics">Verses on a Morning in Town</span>; and on
            							<span class="italics">A City Shower</span>, which are
            					printed in his works, made their first appearance here. The remarks on various
            					preachers then in vogue, No. 66, contain much of the substance of his <span class="italics">Letter to a Clergyman</span>; and the first

            					thought into a volume. The next year <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a> left the whigs, and joined with <a href="people.html#ManleyMrs">Mrs. Manley</a> and others in a party paper
            					called the Examiner, conducted with great virulence on the other
            					side. The Tatler was a kind of newspaper as well as an essay: it
            					was published three times a week, and sold, there being then no stamp-duty, at
            					the low price of a penny.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> kept himself concealed,
            					and was only suspected of being one of the authors till its appearance in
            					volumes. This publication gave as it were the dawn and promise of its successor,
            					the <span class="italics">Spectator</span>; and indeed there are
            					papers in it equal in humour to any of the latter: as the account of the
            					freezing of words in Nova Zembla, the Court of Honour, and some others: but,
            in
            					general, the wit is local and temporary, the style negligent; and even the
            					strain of the graver papers rather gives the idea of a wit who lashes the town,
            					than an elegant moralist who instructs the world. The Tatler

            					Gazetteer. Weary, perhaps, of the responsibility of a paper, of which he was
            now
            					well known to be the editor, and of being personally threatened, as he often
            					was, for the liberties he took with living characters, he suddenly dropped the
            					work on January 2, 1710. It revived in two months' time, under better
            					auspices and with new associates, and bore the title of the <span class="italics">Spectator</span>. <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a> was by this time completely
            					alienated from his old friends; but his defection was more than compensated by

            					grafted on his fame. Many of their papers are pleasing and instructive: yet,

         <p><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> was one of a cluster of men
            					of genius, who, flourishing at a time when the taste of the nation was forming
            					itself, became in their different walks the standards of literary excellence.
            					His peculiar portion was delicate humour, taste, and richness of imagination:

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xv]</p><p class="pnoindent"> and good manners. In
            					these periodical papers he assumed the title of Censor; and no one was better
            					qualified for so delicate and useful an office. Decency and sobriety of
            					behaviour are every where inculcated: every offensive singularity, every outrage
            					of the licentious upon the sober and defenceless part of society, is held up
            to
            					reprobation: marriage, the constant butt of the wits and jest of the stage, is
            					treated with just respect, and its duties enforced. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> says of himself, that as
            						<a href="people.html#Socrates">Socrates</a> made it his boast, that he
            					had drawn down philosophy from the gods to dwell among men, so he shall be
            					satisfied to have it said of him, that he had brought her from schools and
            					colleges to the tea-table and the dressing-room. His talents were well adapted
            					for an undertaking of this sort. His excellence lay not so much in the depth
            or
            					extent of his ideas, as in his pleasing manner of communicating them; in the
            					splendour he diffused over a serious—in the grace with which he touched a
            					lighter subject. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> had a
            					large portion of the honey of <a href="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</a>: nourished like him with the purest flower of classical
            					literature, he possessed a like vivid fancy; a similar fulness and richness of
            					style. </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xvi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> But he also possessed the attic salt of <a href="people.html#Apuleius">Lucian</a>: the manner of this author is so

            					knowledge of <a href="people.html#Menippus">the Greek author</a>, might

         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> had a wonderful talent in
            					working up a hint, and producing a most beautiful fancy-piece from a neglected
            					fragment, a slight outline, or an obscure tradition. Of this, his account of
            the
            					nation of the Amazons, the Loves of Shalum and Hilpah, and the History of the
            					Lovers' Leap, may be given as instances. Even where the substance is
            					borrowed, as in some of the Eastern tales which he has condescended to
            					illustrate; who is not struck with their different effect as clothed in his
            					style, and as we read them in the bald translation of the Arabian Tales?
            					Whatever he touches he turns to gold. If we compare him with the most
            					distinguished of his contemporaries (for to the most distinguished alone can
            he
            					be compared), we shall find he has more ease and simplicity than <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a>, whose wit is not always free
            					from affectation, and whose satire is frequently splenetic, sometimes malignant.

            					that it scarcely offends those whom it chastises.

         <p> To be convinced of this we need only turn our thoughts to the different effect
            					produced by the strictures of each upon the female sex. Both are perhaps in
            					reality equally severe, and by their pleasantries betray a contempt for a sex
            					they probably considered in a very inferior light: yet such is the charm of
            					manner, that the Spectator has ever been the favourite of the
            					toilette and the dressing-room; while it requires no common strength of mind
            in
            					a lady, to overcome the disgust excited by the supercilious harshness of <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">the Irish Dean</a>, and to profit by

            					peeping over the shoulder of the Graces. His wit is refined; it is of a kind
            					that requires and exercises penetration in his reader, who is to catch his
            					meaning from the side views that are dexterously presented to him; for the

            					form the taste, by the beauty of its illustrations: the language of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> is no where more brilliant
            					and highly finished than in some passages of these papers. <a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a>, as is well known, made
            					them the groundwork of his didactic poem, and had little more to do in many
            					parts than to reduce to measure what had already all the other charms of
            						poetry.<span class="sup"><a href="#14" id="back14"><sup>14</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> Several papers are devoted to theatrical entertainments. Such was then the
            					licentiousness of the playhouse, that the austere moralists condemned it
            					altogether. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> did better;
            					for he undertook to reform it; and </p>

            					castigation which he and other writers of taste and virtue have bestowed upon
            					it, that it is at present tolerably free from gross indecency, rant, and
            					profaneness. It was then common for ladies of character to go in a mask the
            					first night of a new play, as they <span class="italics">expected </span>to be
            					put out of countenance. <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</a> had
            					a great share in this reformation, as well by his own comedies as by his
            					strictures on those of others.

         <p> Not content with the incidental and indirect service done to virtue and religion

            					expressly to that purpose. The sentiments of rational and liberal devotion which
            					breathe through them, are blended with the speculations of philosophy and the
            					paintings of a fine imagination. His religious affections break forth at a fine
            					sun-set, the view of the starry heavens, and other circumstances proper to
            					impress a mind of feeling. Of these a portion are presented to the reader;

            					been collected: but the truth is, we abound so much in excellent </p>

            					to be marked with that originality which is meant to form the basis of this
            					Selection. In one particular, we must reluctantly confess, <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> was <span class="italics">not</span> liberal. He had no enlarged ideas of religious
            					toleration. He treats Freethinkers, whom he often attacks, with a contempt and
            					insult by no means consistent with either the philosophy or the urbanity of his
            					character: nay, he gives broad hints that the civil magistrate would be well
            					employed in hunting these vermin, as he calls them, out of society; and talks,
            					half in jest half in earnest, of "blowing an atheist out of the mouth of a
            					cannon." But <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> was, and
            					was accustomed to call himself, a tory in religion, though a whig in
            					politics.

            					imagination, the visions of a poetical fancy, are blended sometimes with
            					sentiment, sometimes with wit and gaiety, and often are illustrative of some

         <p> In the pictures of life and delineation of manners, which make up a large part
            					of the work, the hand of a master is not less apparent. The character of the
            					Spectator himself is well conceived and faithfully kept up; and that of <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</a> is
            					exquisitely drawn. It is however remarkable, that his character, as delineated
            					in the course of the work, is very different from the sketch of it given in the
            					account of the club with which the first volume of the Spectator
            					opens: but that paper is not <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a>'s, and it should seem as if the authors had intended to
            					make more use of those characters than they afterwards found it convenient to
            					do; for the greater part of them come but little into play, and are no way
            					essential to the conduct of the work. <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</a>, in the
            					account given of him in the first paper, is said to have been in his youth a
            man
            					of the town, a fine gentleman, to have supped with wits, blustered in
            					coffee-houses, and fought duels. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a>'s <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir

            					salutary prejudices. By the first paper we are prepared to expect a man whose
            					singularities proceed from good sense and an original cast of thought; a kind
            of
            					humourist, not unlike the elder Shandy;<span class="sup"><a href="#15" id="back15"><sup>15</sup></a> </span> but the singularities of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a>'s <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger</a> proceed from
            					rusticity, and the prejudices of a confined education, operating indeed upon
            a
            					most benevolent and friendly heart. His character is set in a new light, in a
            					paper written by <a href="people.html#AikinJohn">Dr. Aikin</a>, in the
            						Monthly Magazine for February 1800.<span class="sup"><a href="#16" id="back16"><sup>16</sup></a> </span>It is there observed, that this character,
            					though meant to be a favourite, is also meant as a vehicle of satire upon the
            					character of the country gentleman, which <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> has more openly held up to
            					ridicule in the country squire of his Freeholder: they are
            					extremely different with regard to the amiableness of their characters, but they
            					have the same national and party prejudices, and are both intended to exhibit
            					inferiority to the more cultured inhabitant of the town, and to fasten a
            					ridicule upon the tory, which at that time was the country party. In <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger de Coverley</a>,
            					however, this design is subservient to that of </p>

            					amiable and worthy character. <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir
               						Roger</a>'s benevolence, hospitality, piety, and honest open
            					cheerfulness, win our warmest affections; and if we often smile at, we always
            					love him. The reserved, sagacious, and thoughtful character of the
            						Spectator contrasts very well with the simplicity and turn
            					for active sports of the knight. With regard to his passion for the widow, and
            					the effect it is said to have had upon him, it may be doubted whether it forms
            a
            					natural feature in a character like his. Minds that expand themselves in
            					feelings of cheerful good will, and acts of general benevolence, and are at the
            					same time destitute of those nicer discriminations of taste that influence
            					particular predilections, are perhaps not very likely to have the colour of
            					their whole lives affected by a hopeless passion. But <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> has had little to do with
            					that part of his character. Opposed to <a href="people.html#SirRogerdeCoverley">Sir Roger</a> is Sir Andrew
            					Freeport, a London merchant. Trade, though rising fast, or rather already risen
            					into consequence, was despised by the country gentry. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> has frequently taken
            					occasion to set the trading part of the community, who were nearly all whigs,
            in
            					a respectable light, and to show the connection of commerce with science and
            					liberal </p>

            					work, are delineated with great spirit and humour; and the

            					from all the periodical papers which have succeeded them.
         </p>
         <p> Thus various are the merits of an author, whose fame can only perish with the
            					language in which he wrote. As a critic, it is not profound learning or
            					metaphysical subtlety, but exquisite taste; as a philosopher, it is not deep
            					research, but the happy art of unfolding an idea, and placing it in the most
            					attractive light; as a moralist, it is not that energy which rouses and carries
            					away the soul in the vortex of its own enthusiasm; nor the novelty of system,
            					resulting from bold original ideas, but an eloquence urbane, persuasive, and
            					temperate, the alliance of the heart with the imagination, which distinguishes
            					the page of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a>. In strokes of
            					delicate humour and refined wit he is inexhaustible; but he has given us no
            					instance of the pathetic, except in his story of Theodosius and Constantia.

            					style is negligent; and though he has endeavoured to serve the cause of virtue,

         <p> The Guardians may be considered as a kind of sequel to the
            						Spectators. They were in two volumes. The strain of them is
            					somewhat less sprightly; but they contain many excellent papers, and among them
            					several by <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a>. The
            						Guardian was published in the year 1713, between the seventh
            					and eighth volumes of the Spectator. For what reason the authors
            					dropped, changed, and resumed their title in so short a space, cannot now be
            					known. The Guardian has, like the Spectator, a set
            					of characters as a frame to the work, my Lady Lizard and her sons and daughters,
            					to whom Nestor Ironside is the Guardian; but they are drawn with less spirit
            					than those of the club in the Spectator, and both have the fault
            					of not being necessary to the conduct of the work. It is justly observed by Dr.
            						<a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Johnson</a>, that the grave </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> character of a Guardian, and a guardian to young ladies, is
            					unfavourable to the propriety of the lighter papers. What, says he, have clubs
            					of tall and short men to do with the education of Lady Lizard's daughters?
            					The only <span class="italics">set</span> of papers in these volumes is that on
            					pastoral poetry, written, it should seem, by <a href="people.html#TickellThomas">Tickell</a>, perhaps with the
            					assistance of <a href="people.html#PhilipsAmbrose">Phillips</a>, and some
            					touches of <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a>. They contain
            					many just criticisms on a species of poetry now almost obsolete, but at one
            					period so much in fashion, that there was hardly a poet who did not try his hand
            					at it; till at length it became insipid by the triteness of the sentiment, and
            					the servile use of the heathen mythology. The lovers of Italian poetry will by
            					no means be satisfied to see the beautiful poems of Aminta and Pastor Fido<span class="sup"><a href="#18" id="back18"><sup>18</sup></a> </span> only
            					mentioned to be found fault with; but English readers had, at that time, little
            					relish for the belles lettres of other nations. The Italian language was perhaps
            					less cultivated than in the preceding century. <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> himself had a sufficient
            					portion of national prejudice, as appears whenever the French writers are
            					incidentally mentioned. The concluding allegory on pastoral poetry exhibits much
            					elegant fancy, along with a strange con- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxxiii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> fusion in the
            					application of it to different writers, and the periods in which they
            					flourished. The critique on <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a>'s Pastorals by that author himself, is remarkable for the
            					delicacy and artful irony which imposed on the editor of the paper, and secured
            					its insertion, though it was, in fact, a concealed ridicule on <a href="people.html#PhilipsAmbrose">Phillips</a>, whose pastorals it had
            					been the aim of the former papers to extol.
         </p>
         <p> The Freeholder was a direct party paper, written by <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> alone, on the side of
            					Government, immediately after the rebellion of 1715, when perhaps one half of
            					the nation were Jacobites in their hearts. It can of course supply little matter
            					for a selection of this kind: yet a few papers are given, both as they possess
            					genuine humour, and because, as <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> himself remarks, future readers may see in them the
            					complexion of the times in which they were written. His country squire is drawn
            					with great humour and much effect, as the representative of a set of men who
            					were then almost all partisans against the court, if not favourers of the Stuart
            					family.

            							bear-baiting, prize-fighting, and similar sports. It was attended by
            							butchers, drovers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; also by people of the highest
            							fashion, for whom there were seats set apart, ornamented with old
            							tapestry hangings, the price of which was half-a-crown. Its
            							neighbourhood was notorious for pick-pockets and infamous women. May
            							Fair, another place of disorderly resort, was abolished in 1709 [<a href="people.html#BarbauldMrs">Barbauld</a>'s note].
