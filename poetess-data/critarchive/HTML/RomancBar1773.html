            productions which the efforts of superior genius, or the labours of scholastic
            industry, have crowded upon the world, none are perused with more insatiable
            avidity, or disseminated with more universal applause, than the narrations of

            characters. The celebrity of other authors is confined within very narrow
            limits. The Geometrician and Divine, the Antiquary and Critic, however
            distinguished by uncontested excellence, can only hope to please those whom a
            conformity of disposition has engaged in similar pursuits; and must be content
            to be regarded by the rest of the world with the smile of frigid indifference,
            or the contemptuous sneer of self-sufficient folly. The collector of shells and
            the anatomist of insects is little inclined to enter into theological disputes:
            the Divine is not apt to regard with veneration the uncouth diagrams and tedious
            calculations of the Astronomer: the man whose life has been consumed in
            adjusting the disputes of lexicographers, or elucidating the learning of
            antiquity, cannot easily bend his thoughts to recent transactions, or readily
            interest himself in the</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 41]</p><p class="pnoindent">unimportant history of his contemporaries:
            and the Cit, who knows no business but acquiring wealth, and no pleasure but
            displaying it, has a heart equally shut up to argument and fancy, to the
            batteries of syllogism, and the arrows of wit. To the writer of fiction alone,
            every ear is open, and every tongue lavish of applause; curiosity sparkles in
            every eye, and every bosom is throbbing with concern.
         </p>
         <p>I<span class="smcaps">t</span> is however easy to account for this enchantment.
            To follow the chain of perplexed ratiocination, to view with critical skill the
            airy architecture of systems, to unravel the web of sophistry, or weigh the
            merits of opposite hypotheses, requires perspicacity, and presupposes learning.
            Works of this kind, therefore, are not so well adapted to the generality of
            readers as familiar and colloquial composition;</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 42]</p><p class="pnoindent">for few can reason,
            but all can feel; and many who cannot enter into an argument, may yet listen to
            a tale. The writer of Romance has even an advantage over those who endeavour to
            amuse by the play of fancy; who from the fortuitous collision of dissimilar
            ideas produce the scintillations of wit; or by the vivid glow of poetical
            imagery delight the imagination with colours of ideal radiance. The attraction
            of the magnet is only exerted upon similar particles; and to taste the beauties
            of <a href="people.html#Homer">Homer</a> it is requisite to partake his
            fire: but every one can relish the author who represents common life, because
            every one can refer to the originals from whence his ideas were taken. He
            relates events to which all are liable, and applies to passions which all have
            felt. The gloom of solitude, the languor of inaction, the corrosions of
            disappointment, and the toil of thought, induce men to</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 43]</p><p class="pnoindent">step aside
            from the rugged road of life, and wander in the fairy land of fiction; where
            every bank is sprinkled with flowers, and every gale loaded with perfume; where
            every event introduces a hero, and every cottage is inhabited by a Grace.
            Invited by these flattering scenes, the student quits the investigation of
            truth, in which he perhaps meets with no less fallacy, to exhilerate his mind
            with new ideas, more agreeable, and more easily attained: the busy relax their
            attention by desultory reading, and smooth the agitation of a ruffled mind with
            images of peace, tranquillity, and pleasure: the idle and the gay relieve the
            listlessness of leisure, and diversify the round of life by a rapid series of
            events pregnant with rapture and astonishment; and the pensive solitary fills up
            the vacuities of his heart by interesting himself in the fortunes of imaginary
            beings, and forming connections with ideal excellence.

         <p>I<span class="smcaps">t</span> is, indeed, no ways extraordinary that the mind
            should be charmed by fancy, and attracted by pleasure; but that we should listen
            to the groans of misery, and delight to view the exacerbations of complicated
            anguish, that we should chuse to chill the bosom with imaginary fears, and dim
            the eyes with fictitious sorrow, seems a kind of paradox of the heart, and only
            to be credited because it is universally felt. Various are the hypotheses which
            have been formed to account for the disposition of the mind to riot in this
            species of intellectual luxury. Some have imagined that we are induced to
            acquiesce with greater patience in our own lot, by beholding pictures of life
            tinged with deeper horrors, and loaded with more excruciating calamities; as, to
            a person suddenly emerging out of a dark room, the faintest glimmering of
            twilight assumes a lustre from the contrasted gloom. O-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 45]</p><p class="pnoindent">thers, with
            yet deeper refinement, suppose that we take upon ourselves this burden of
            adscititious sorrows in order to feast upon the consciousness of our own virtue.
            We commiserate others (say they) that we may applaud ourselves; and the sigh of
            compassionate sympathy is always followed by the gratulations of self-complacent
            esteem. But surely they who would thus reduce the sympathetic emotions of pity
            to a system of refined selfishness, have but ill attended to the genuine
            feelings of humanity. It would however exceed the limits of this paper, should I
            attempt an accurate investigation of these sentiments. But let it be remembered,
            that we are more attracted by those scenes which interest our passions, or
            gratify our curiosity, than those which delight our fancy: and so far from being
            indifferent to the miseries of others, we are, at the time, totally regardless
            of our own. And </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 46]</p><p class="pnoindent">let not those, on whom the hand of time has
            impressed the characters of oracular wisdom, censure with too much acrimony
            productions which are thus calculated to please the imagination, and interest
            the heart. They teach us to think, by inuring us to feel: they ventilate the
            mind by sudden gusts of passion; and prevent the stagnation of thought, by a
            fresh infusion of dissimilar ideas.
