            					grave impressive moral resulting from the whole, imply talents of the highest
            					order, and ought to command our warmest praise. There is no walk in which taste
            					and genius have more distinguished themselves, or in which virtuous and noble
            					sentiments have come out with greater lustre, than in the splendid fictions,
            or
            					pathetic tales, with which France, Germany, Switzerland, and our own country,
            					have adorned the annals of their literature. A history of romance writing, under
            					all its various forms, would be an acceptable present to the public, if given
            by
            					a man of taste and sufficient reading. But there are some periods which make,
            as
            					it were, a new era in this kind of writing, and those productions are more
            					particularly deserving our attention which stand at the head of a class, and
            					have diverted the taste of the public into some new channel. Of this kind are
            					the writings of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Mr. Richardson</a>,
            					whose name, on the </p>

            					public. He may, in a great measure, be said to be the father of the modern novel
            					of the serious or pathetic kind, and he was also an original in the mode of
            					epistolary writing by which he carried on the story. 
         </p>
         <p> If we were to search among the treasures of ancient literature for fictions
            					similar to the modern novel, we should find none more nearly resembling it than
            						<span class="italics">Theagenes and Chariclea</span>, the
            					production of <a href="people.html#Heliodorus">Heliodorus</a>, a Christian
            					bishop of Trieca, in Thessaly. Though his romance was unexceptionably pure and
            					virtuous, he was called upon either to burn his book, or resign his bishopric;
            					upon which, with the heroism of an author, he chose the latter.

         <p> But, after Europe had sunk into barbarism, a taste was again to be formed; and a
            					taste for the natural, the graceful, and the simple-pathetic, is generally the
            					late result of a long course of civilization.

         <p>Every one knows the character of the romances of chivalry—Amadis de
            						Gaul at their head, with whose merits the English reader has lately
            					been made acquainted in an elegant abridged version.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> They were
            					properly historical, but they heightened the traditionary adventures of the
            					heroes of their different countries, with the more wonderful stories of giants,
            					enchantments, and other embellishments of the supernatural kind. But we are not
            					to suppose that even these fictions were considered, as we now consider them,
            					the mere play of the imagination: "<span class="italics">le vrai seul
               						est aimable</span>"<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> was always so far a maxim,
            					that no work of imagination can greatly succeed, which is not founded upon
            					popular belief; but what is <span class="italics">le vrai</span>? In those
            					times talismans, and wounds cured by sympathetic powder, and charms of all
            					kinds, were seriously credited. 
         </p>
         <p> A great deal of love adventure was intermixed in these narratives, but not
            					always </p>
            <hr></hr>

            					the vehicle of them, particularly in Italy: the <span class="italics">Orlando Furioso</span> of <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Ariosto">Ariosto</a></span>, is a chivalrous romance
            					in verse.
         </p>
         <p> As, however, the spirit of military adventure subsided, these softened, by
            					degrees, into the languishing love romances of the French school—the
            						Clelias and Cassandras, the laboured
            					productions of the <a href="people.html#LaCalprenede">Calprenedes</a> and
            						<a href="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Scuderis</a>. I might indeed
            					have mentioned before these a romance of a peculiar kind, the
            						Astrea of <a href="people.html#UrfeHonored">d'Urfé</a>, which all France read with eagerness at the time it
            					was published. It is a pastoral romance, and its celebrity was, in a great
            					measure, owing to its being strongly seasoned with allusions to the amours of
            					the court of <a href="people.html#HenryIVKingofFrance">Henry the

            					however, they were a step nearer to nature; the adventures were marvellous, but
            					not impossible. Their personages were all removed from common life, and taken
            					from ancient history; but without the least resemblance to the heroes whose
            					names they bore. The manners therefore, and the passions, referred to an ideal
            					world, the creation of the writer; but the situations were often striking, and
            					the sentiments always noble. They would have reigned longer, had they been less

            					the world about him he took the incidents, manners, and general character, of
            					the times in which he lived, and from his own beautiful ideas he copied that

            					called on to wonder at improbable events, but to be moved by natural passions,
            					and impressed by salutary maxims. The pathos of the story, and the dignity of

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page xxiii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> manner of this captivating writer
            					was also new. 
         </p>
         <p> There are three modes of carrying on a story: the narrative or epic as it may be
            					called; in this the author relates himself the whole adventure; this is the
            					manner of <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</a> in his Don
            						Quixote, and of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> in his Tom Jones. It is the most common way.
            					The author, like the muse, is supposed to know every thing; he can reveal the
            					secret springs of actions, and let us into events in his own time and manner.
            He
            					can be concise, or diffuse, according as the different parts of his story
            					require it. He can indulge, as <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a> has done, in digressions, and thus deliver sentiments and
            					display knowledge which would not properly belong to any of the characters. But
            					his narration will not be lively, except he frequently drops himself, and runs
            					into dialogue: all good writers therefore have thrown as much as possible of
            the
            					dramatic into their narrative. <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Mad.</a></p>

            					successfully, that we have as clear an idea, not only of the sentiments, but
            the
            					manner of expression of her different personages, as if we took it from the
            					scenes in a play. 
         </p>
         <p> Another mode is that of memoirs; where the subject of the adventures relates his
            					own story. <a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a>, in his
            						Roderic Random, and <a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a>, in his Vicar of Wakefield, have adopted
            					this mode; it confines the author's stile, which should be suited, though
            					it is not always, to the supposed talents and capacity of the imaginary
            					narrator. It has the advantage of the warmth and interest a person may be
            					supposed to feel in his own affairs; and he can more gracefully dwell upon
            					minute circumstances which have affected him. It has a greater air of truth,
            as
            					it seems to account for the communication to the public. The author, it is true,
            					knows every thing, but when the secret recesses of the heart are to be laid

            					beginning of it. The author has all along two characters to support, for he has
            					to consider how his hero felt at the time the events to be related, and how it
            					is natural he should feel them at the time he is relating them; at a period,

         <p> A third way remains, that of <span class="italics">epistolary

            					the form made use of by <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> and many others after, none, I believe, before him. He
            					seems to have been led to it by circumstances in his early youth, which will
            be
            					hereafter related. This method unites, in a good measure, the advantages of the
            					other two; it gives the feelings of the moment as the writers felt them <span class="italics">at</span> the moment. It allows a pleasing variety of
            					stile, if the author has sufficient command of pen to assume it. It makes the
            					whole work dramatic, since all the characters speak in their own persons. It
            					accounts for breaks in the story, by the omission or loss of letters. It is
            					incompatible with a rapid stile, but gives room for the graceful introduction
            of
            					remark and sentiment, or any kind, almost, of digressive matter. But, on the

            					the least probable way of telling a story. That letters should be written at
            all
            					times, and upon every occasion in life, that those letters should be preserved,
            					and altogether form a connected story, it requires much art to render specious.
            					It introduces the inconvenience so much felt in dramatic writing, for want of
            a
            					narrator; the necessity of having an insipid confidant to tell the circumstances
            					so that an author cannot relate in any other way. It obliges a man to tell of
            					himself, what perhaps no man would tell; and sometimes to repeat compliments
            					which modesty would lead him to suppress: and when a long conversation is
            					repeated, supposes a memory more exact than is generally found. Artificial as
            it
            					therefore is, still as it enables an author to assume, in a lively manner, the

               <p>From my earliest youth, I had a love of letter-writing: I was not

                  							frequenter of church ordinances, was continually fomenting quarrels and
                  							disturbances, by backbiting and scandal, among all her acquaintance. I
                  							collected from the scripture texts that made against her. Assuming the
                  							style and address of a person in years, I exhorted her, I expostulated
                  							with her. But my hand-writing was known. I was challenged with it, and
                  							owned the boldness; for she complained of it to my mother with tears. My
                  							mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her
                  							years; but knowing that her son was not of a pert or forward nature,
                  							but, on the contrary, shy and bashful, she commended my principles,

            					selfish, forbidding, (selfish, that is to say, in his love, for he has
            					generosity enough in money matters) and his ideas of the authority of a husband
            					are so high, that it is not easy to conceive of <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a>'s being rewarded by
            					marrying him, unless her regard for external circumstances was greater than the
            					author would wish to have supposed. The moral of this piece is more dubious
            					than, in his life time, the author's friends were willing to allow. So long
            					as <a href="people.html#PamelaAndrews">Pamela</a> is solely occupied in
            					schemes to escape from her persecutor, her virtuous resistance obtains our
            					unqualified approbation; but from the moment she begins to entertain hopes of
            					marrying him, we admire her guarded prudence, rather than her purity of mind.
            					She has an end in view, an interested end, and we can only consider her as the
            					conscious possessor of a treasure, which </p>

            					repentant lover ought to have followed her to her father's cottage, and to
            					have married her from thence. The familiar footing upon which she condescends
            to
            					live with the odious <a href="people.html#MrsJewkes">Jewkes</a>, shews
            					also, that her fear of offending the man she hoped to make her husband, had got
            					the better of her delicacy and just resentment, and the same fear leads her to
            					give up her correspondence with honest <a href="people.html#WilliamsMr">Mr.

            <p> About twenty-five years ago, a gentleman, with whom I was intimately

               						servant only. At every inn he put up at, it was his way to inquire after
               						curiosities in its neighbourhood, either ancient or modern; and particularly
               						he asked who was the owner of a fine house, as it seemed to him, beautifully
               						situated, which he had passed by (describing it) within a mile or two of the
               						inn. 
            </p>
            <p> It was a fine house, the landlord said. The owner was Mr. B. a gentleman of

         <p> On this slight foundation, and on a story not very agreeable or promising in its
            					rude outline, has our author founded a most pathetic tale, and raised a noble
            					temple to female virtue. The first volumes are somewhat tedious, from the
            					prolixity incident to letter-writing, and require a persevering reader to get
            					through them: but the circumstantial manner of writing which <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> practised, has the
            					advantage of making the reader thoroughly acquainted with those in whose fate
            he
            					is to be interested. In consequence of this, our feelings are not transient,
            					elicited here and there by a pathetic stroke; but we regard his characters as
            					real personages, whom we know and converse with, and whose fate remains to be
            					decided in the course of events. The characters, much more numerous than in
            						Pamela, are all </p>

            					parts. The plot, as we have seen, is simple, and no under-plots interfere with
            					the main design. No digressions, no episodes. It is wonderful that without these
            					helps of common writers, he could support a work of such length. With <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> it begins,—with

            					surprises: we see her fate from afar, as it were through a long avenue, the
            					gradual approach to which, without ever losing sight of the object, has more
            of
            					simplicity and grandeur than the most cunning labyrinth that can be contrived

            he
            					could not do, for the man whom <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a> was inclined to favour. Besides, if it was part of his

            					with her hard-hearted family, shew the severe struggles she had with herself,
            					before she could withdraw her obedience from her parents. The measure of that
            					obedience, in <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>'s

            					resent the injustice, of imposing a husband upon her without her own consent.

            					is easy to see she would have thought it her duty to comply, if he had not been
            					quite so disagreeable. The mother is a very mean character; she gives a tacit

            					putting herself into the power of a lover, without annexing to it the strongest

            					this he was himself sufficiently sensible, and often laments it. "My

            She
