         <p class="pnoindent">"O<span class="smcaps">h</span>! mes amis,
            					rapellez-vous quelquefois mes vers; mon ame y est empreinte." "Mon ame
            					y est empreinte."<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> Such is the secret of poetry. There
            					cannot be a greater error than to suppose that the poet does not feel what he
            					writes. What an extraordinary, I might say, impossible view, is this to take
            of
            					an art more connected with emotion than any of its sister sciences.
            					What—the depths of the heart are to be sounded, its mysteries unveiled,
            					and its beatings numbered by those whose own heart is made by this strange
            					doctrine—a mere machine wound up by the clock-work of rhythm! No; poetry
            					is even more a passion than a power, and nothing is so strongly impressed on
            					composition as the character of the writer. I should almost define poetry to
            be
            					the necessity of feeling strongly in the first instance, and the as strong
            					necessity of confiding in the second.
         </p>
         <p>It is curious to observe the intimate relation that subsists between the poet and
            					the public. "Distance lends enchantment to the view,"<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> and
            					those who would shrink from avowing what and how much they feel to even the most
            					trusted friend, yet rely upon and crave for the sympathy of the many. The belief
            					that it exists in the far off and the unknown is inherent as love or death.
            					Under what pressure of the most discouraging circumstances has it existed, given
            					enjoyment, and stimulated to exertion. The ill-fated and yet gifted being,
            					steeped to the lips in poverty—that bitterest closer of the human
            					heart—surrounded by the cold and the careless—shrinking from his
            					immediate circle, who neglect and misunderstand him, has yet faith in the far
            					away. Suffering discourses eloquent music, and it believes that such music will
            					find an echo and reply where the music only is known, and the maker loved for
            					its sake.
         </p>
         <p>Fame, which the Greeks idealized so nobly, is but the fulfillment of that desire
            					for sympathy which can never be brought home to the individual. It is the
            					essence of such a nature to ask too much. It expects to be divined where its
            too
            					shy to express. Praise—actual personal praise—oftener frets and
            					embarrasses than it encourages. It is too small when too near. There is also
            the
            					fear of mistaking the false Florimel flattery for the true Florimel praise.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> Hence Hope takes the wings of the
            						morning,<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> and seeks an atmosphere,
            					warm, kindly, and congenial, and where it is not ashamed. Without such timidity,
            					without such irritability, without a proneness to exaggeration, the poetical
            					temperament could not exist. Nor is its reliance on distance and on solitude
            in
            					vain. We talk, and can never be sure but that our hearers listen as much from
            					kindness as from interest. Their mood may or may not be in unison with our own.
            					If this be the case even in ordinary intercourse, how much more must it be felt
            					where the most shrinking, subtle, and sorrowful ideas are to be expressed. But
            					the poet relies on having his written page opened when the spirit is attuned
            to
            					it melody. He asks to be read in the long summer-mornings, when the green is
            					golden on the trees, when the bird sings on the boughs, and the insect </p>

         <p> In such a mood the voice of passionate complaining is both understood and
            					welcome. There is a well of melancholy poetry in every human bosom. We have all
            					mourned over the destroyed illusion and the betrayed hope. We have quarrelled
            in
            					some embittered moment with an early friend, and when too late lamented the
            					estrangement. We have all stood beside the grave, and asked of the long grass

            					beloved has long since gone down to the dust. How many have </p>

         <p>I believe that no poet ever made his readers feel unless he had himself felt. The
            					many touching poems which most memories keep as favourites originated in some
            					strong personal sensation. I do not mean to say that the fact is set down, but
            					if any feeling is marked in the writing, that feeling has been keenly and
            					painfully experienced. No indication of its existence would probably be shown
            in
            					ordinary life: first, because the relief of expression has already been found
            in
            					poetry, and secondly, from that extreme sensitiveness which shrinks from contact
            					with the actual. Moreover, the habit has so grown up with us,—so grown
            					with our growth, and strengthened with our strength, that we scarcely know the
            					extraordinary system of dissimulation carried on in our present state of
            					society.
         </p>
         <p> In childhood, the impetus of conversation is curiosity. The child talks to ask
            					questions. But one of its first lessons, as it advances, is that a question is
            					an intrusion, and an answer a deceit. Ridicule parts social life like an
            					invisible paling; and we are all of us afraid of the other. To this may be in
            					great measure attributed the difference that exists between an author's
            					writings and his conversation. The one is often sad and thoughtful, while the
            					other is lively and careless. The fact is, that the real character is shown in
            					the first instance, and the assumed in the second. Besides the impulses of an
            					imaginative temperament are eager and easily excited, and gaiety has its
            					impulses as well as despondency, but it is less shy of showing them. Only those
            					in the habit of seclusion, occupied with their own thoughts, can know what a
            					relief it is sometimes to spring, as it were, out of themselves. The fertile
            					wit, the sunny vivacity, belong to a nature which must be what the French so
            					happily term <span class="italics">impressionable</span> to be poetical. The

         <p> No emotion is more truly, or more often pictured in her song, than that craving
            					for affection which answers not unto the call. The very power that she
            					possesses, and which, in early youth, she perhaps deemed would both attract and
            					keep, is, in reality, a drawback. Nothing can stand its test. The love which
            the
            					spirit hath painted has too much of its native heaven for earth. In how many
            and
            					exquisite shapes is this vain longing introduced on her page. Some slight
            					incident gives the framework, but she casts her own colour upon the picture.
            In
            					this consists the difference between painting and poetry: the painter reproduces
            					others,—the poet reproduces himself. We would draw attention especially to
            					one or two poems in which the sentiment is too true for Mrs. <a href="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</a> not to have been her own
            					inspiration. Is it not the heart's long-suppressed bitterness that

         <p> Did we not know this world to be but a place of trial—our bitter probation
            					for another and for a better—how strange in its severity would seem the
            					lot of genius in a woman. The keen feeling—the generous
            					enthusiasm—the lofty aspiration—and the delicate
            					perception—are given but to make the possessor unfitted for her actual
            					position. It is well; such gifts, in their very contrast to the selfishness and
            					the evil with which they are surrounded, inform us of another world—they
            					breathe of their home, which is Heaven; the spiritual and the inspired in this
            					life but fit us to believe in that which is to come. With what a sublime faith
            					is this divine reliance expressed in all Mrs. <a href="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</a>'s later writings. As
            					the clouds towards nightfall melt away on a fine summer evening into the clear
            					amber of the west, leaving a soft and unbroken azure whereon the stars may shine
            					through; so the troubles of life, its vain regrets and vainer desires, vanished
            					before the calm close of existence—the hopes of Heaven rose steadfast at
            					last—the light shone from the windows of her home as she approached unto
            					it. </p>

         <p> We have noticed this yearning for affection—unsatisfied, but still
            					unsubdued—as one characteristic of Mrs. <a href="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</a>'s poetry: the rich
            					picturesque was another. Highly accomplished, the varied stores that she
            					possessed were all subservient to one master science. Mistress both of German
            					and Spanish, the latter country appears to have peculiarly captivated her
            					imagination. At that period when the fancy is peculiarly alive to
            					impression—when girlhood is so new, that the eagerness of childhood is
            					still in its delights—Spain was, of all others, the country on which
            					public attention was fixed: victory after victory carried the British flag from
            					the ocean to the Pyrenees; but, with that craving for the ideal which is so
            					great a feature in her writings, the present was insufficient, and she went back
            					upon the past;—the romantic history of the Moors was like a storehouse,
            					with treasures gorgeous like those of its own Alhambra. 
         </p>
         <p> It is observable in her minor poems that they turn upon an incident rather than

            					harmony. I use the word harmony advisedly, in contradistinction to melody.
            					Melody implies something more careless, more simple, than belongs to her style:

            					of her with her appreciation of one fine mind comprehending another, and with
            					the earnest affection of a woman and a friend. She described her conversation
            as
            					singularly fascinating—full of poetry, very felicitous in illustration by
            					anecdote, happy, too, in quotation, and very rich in imagery; "in short,
            					her own poem on 'The Treasures of the Deep' would best describe
            					it." She mentioned a very striking simile to which a conversation on Mrs.

            					"The Sceptic"<span class="sup"><a href="#26" id="back26"><sup>26</sup></a> </span> had led:— </p>

            					said, "No; her enjoyment is feverish, and she desponds. She is like a lamp

            					than the spirit which pervades the whole: it is the intuitive sense of right,

            					of it as a profession which has to make its way through poverty, neglect, and
            					obstacles: she lived apart in a small, affectionate circle of friends. The high

            					dust that rests on all—was for her happily at a distance; yet even in such
            					green nest, the bird could not fold its wings, and sleep to its own music. There
            					came the aspiring, the unrest, the aching sense of being misunderstood, the
            					consciousness that those a thousand times inferior were yet more beloved. Genius
            					places a woman in an unnatural position; notoriety frightens away affection;

            					of society,—"You consider society something like a
            					honeycomb—sweet, but hollow; so do I. But you seemed also to consider it
            					expedient for every one by right or courtesy termed 'distinguished' to

            					endurable than the heartlessness of the world; nay, as if the polished
            					chain-mail of the latter were the only garb fit to be worn by the former.
