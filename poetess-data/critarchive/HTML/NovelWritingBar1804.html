         <p> THERE is no period in the history of any nation, at all advanced in literature,
            					in which fictitious narratives have not made a large part of the reading in
            					which men have most delighted. They have been grafted on the actions of their
            					heroes, interwoven with their mythology, moulded on the manners of the age, and,
            					in return, have influenced not a little the manners of the next generation, by
            					the principles they have inculcated, and the sensibilities they have exercised.
            					A spirit of adventure, a high sense of honour, of martial glory, refined and
            					romantic, sentimental delicacy, or all the enthusiasm of humanity, have been,
            in
            					their turns, inspired by this powerful engine, which takes so strong a hold on
            					the fancy and the passions of young readers. Accompanied with the embellishments
            					of poetry, they produce the epic; concentrating the incidents, and exchanging
            					story for action, they become dra-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 694]</p><p class="pnoindent">matic; allied with some great
            					moral or political end, didactic, as in the Telemachus of <a href="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</a>, and the
            						Belisarius of <a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a>. They are often the vehicles of satire, as in the
            						Candid and Baboue of <a href="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, and the
            						Gulliver of <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>. They take a tincture from the learning and politics of the
            					times, and are often successfully employed to attack or to recommend the
            					prevailing systems of the day. We have seen liberty and equality recommended
            by
            					one performance, and ridiculed in another. When the range of this kind of
            					writing is so extensive, and its efficacy so great, it is evidently entitled
            to
            					hold no mean rank among the productions of genius; and, in truth, there is
            					hardly any department of literature in which we shall meet with more fine
            					writing than in the best productions of this kind. It is not easy, therefore,
            to
            					say, why the poet should have so high a place allotted him in the temple of
            					Fame, and the romance writer so low a one, as the general voice assigns him;
            for
            					his dignity has by no means been measured by the pleasure he affords to his
            					readers; yet the invention of a story, the choice of proper incidents, the
            					modelling of a plan, the exhibition of character, the gradual unfolding of a
            					plot, occasional beauties of description, and, above all, the power exercised
            					over the reader's heart, by filling it with the emotions of love, pity,
            					joy, anguish, transport, or indignation, together with the grave and affecting
            					moral resulting from the whole, imply talents of the highest order, and ought
            to
            					command our warmest praise. There is no walk in which taste and genius have more
            					distinguished themselves, or in which virtuous and noble sentiments have been
            					displayed with greater lustre, than in the splendid fictions, or pathetic tales,
            					with which France, Germany, Switzerland, and England have adorned their
            					literature. A history of romance, under all its forms, would be highly valuable,
            					if given by a man of taste, and of ample reading. But there are some periods
            					which form a new era in this kind of writing, and those productions particularly
            					deserve our attention, which stand at the head of a class, and have diverted
            the
            					taste of the public into some new channel. Of this kind are the writings of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>. He may, in a great
            					measure, be said to be the father of the modern novel of the serious or pathetic
            					kind, and he was also original in the epistolary mode by which he carried on
            the
            					story. 
         </p>
         <p> Should we search among the treasures of ancient literature for fictions similar
            					to the modern novel, we should find none more nearly resembling it than
            						"Theagenes and Chariclea," the work of <a href="people.html#Heliodorus">Heliodorus</a>, a christian bishop of
            					Trieca, in Thessaly. Though his romance was unexceptionably pure and virtuous,
            					he was required either to burn his book or resign his bishopric; upon which,
            					with the heroism of an author, he chose the latter.
         </p>
         <p> But after Europe had sunk into barbarism, a taste was again to be formed; and a
            					taste for the natural, the graceful, and the simply-pathetic is generally the
            					last step in the progress of civilization.
         </p>
         <p> We know the character of the romances of chivalry....Amadis de
            						Gaul at their head, with whose merits the English reader has lately
            					been made acquainted, in an elegant abridged version.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> They were truly
            					historical, but they heightened the traditionary adventures of heroes with
            					marvellous tales of giants, enchantments, and other supernatural contrivances.
            					But we must not suppose that even these fictions were always regarded, as we
            now
            					regard them, as the mere play of fancy: "<span class="italics">le vrai
               						seul est aimable</span>" <span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> was always so far a maxim, that no work of fancy can greatly
            					succeed, which is not founded on popular belief: but what is truth? In ancient
            					times, talismans, and sympathetic powders, and all-healing charms, were
            					generally credited.
         </p>
         <p> Much love adventure was admitted into these narratives, but not always of the
            					purest or most delicate </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 695]</p><p class="pnoindent">kind. Poetry was often made the vehicle,
            					especially in Italy: <span class="italics">Orlando
               						Furioso</span><span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> is a
            					chivalrous romance in verse. 
         </p>
         <p> As the spirit of warlike adventure subsided, these fictions softened, by
            					degrees, into the languishing and amorous tales of the French school....into
            						Clelias and Cassandras.<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> I might, indeed, have mentioned, before these,
            					a romance of a peculiar kind, the Astrea of <a href="people.html#UrfeHonored">d' Urf√©</a>, which all France
            					read with eagerness, when first published. It is a pastoral romance, and its
            					celebrity was owing to its abounding with allusions to the amours of the court
            					of <a href="people.html#HenryIVKingofFrance">Henry the fourth</a>.
         </p>
         <p> The principle of these romances was high honour, impregnable chastity, a
            					constancy unshaken by time or accident, and a species of love so exalted and
            					refined, that it bore but little resemblance to a natural passion. In the story,
            					they approached a step nearer to nature; the adventures were marvellous, but
            not
            					impossible. Their personages were all remote from common life, and taken from
            					ancient history, but without the least resemblance to the heroes whose names
            					they bore. The manners, therefore, and the passions, referred to an ideal world,
            					the creation of the writer; but the situations were often striking, and the
            					sentiments always chaste and noble. They would have reigned longer, had they
            					been less tedious. <a href="people.html#Boileau">Boileau</a> ridiculed
            					these, as <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</a> had done the
            					others, and their knell was rung: people were ready to wonder they had ever
            					admired them. 
         </p>
         <p> A closer imitation of nature began now to be required: from the earliest times,
            					however, there had been tales built upon real life, a few of them serious, but
            					the greater part comic. The <span class="italics">Decamerone</span> of <a href="people.html#Boccaccio">Boccacio</a>, the <span class="italics">Cent
               						Nouvelles</span> of the <a href="people.html#MargueriteofNavarre">queen of Navarre</a>, <span class="italics">contes</span> and <span class="italics">fableaux</span> without number, may be considered as
            					novels, though of a lighter texture: they abounded with adventure, generally
            of
            					the humorous, often of the licentious kind, and, indeed, were mostly founded
            on
            					amorous intrigues, while the nobler passions were seldom touched. The <span class="italics">Roman Comique</span> of <a href="people.html#Scarron">Scarron</a> is a regular piece of its kind,
            					and possesses great merit in the humorous way; but the <span class="italics">Zaide</span> and the <span class="italics">Princesse de Cleves</span> of <a href="people.html#LaFayetteMadame">Madame de la Fayette</a>, are deemed
            					the first that approach the modern novel of the serious kind, the latter
            					especially: they were written in the reign of <a href="people.html#LouisXIVKingofFrance">Louis XIV</a>, greatly admired,
            					and considered as forming a new era in works of invention. <a href="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</a> says they were "the first
            					romances in which were seen natural incidents, and the manners of good company,
            					described with elegance. Before her time, improbable adventures were related
            in
            					a turgid and affected style."<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span>
            					The novels of <a href="people.html#LaFayetteMadame">Madame la Fayette</a>
            					are certainly beautiful, but a step is still wanting; they no longer speak,
            					indeed, of <a href="people.html#AlexandertheGreat">Alexander</a>s and <a href="people.html#BrutusMarcus">Brutus</a>'s, still less of giants
            					and fairies; but the heroes and heroines are princes and princesses. They are
            					not people of our acquaintance. The scene is perhaps in Spain, or among the
            					Moors: it does not reflect the picture of domestic life, they are not the men
            					and women we daily see about us.
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics"><a href="people.html#LeSageAlain">Le
                  						Sage</a></span>, in his <span class="italics">Gil
               						Blas</span>, a work of infinite diversion, though of dubious morality,
            					presented us such people; but his portraits were mostly humorous, and his work
            					was rather a series of separate adventures than a chain of events concurring
            to
            					produce one catastrophe. There was still wanting a mode of writing which should
            					connect the high passions and delicate sentiments of the old romance, with
            					characters moving in our own sphere of life, and brought into action by events
            					of daily occurrence. 
         </p>
         <p> In the earlier periods of English history, we had our share of the rude
            					literature of the times, and we were familiar, either in translations or works
            					of our own growth, with </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 696]</p><p class="pnoindent">the heroes of chivalry, many of whom
            					belonged to our own country. We had also, in common with our neighbours, the
            					monkish legends, a species of romance abounding with the marvellous, and
            					particularly suited to the taste of a superstitious age. Many of these merit
            					attention as a considerable class of fictions: they have been justly exploded
            					for their falsehood; they should not be preserved for their invention: they are
            					now harmless: they can no longer excite our indignation; let them be permitted
            					still to amuse our fancy. 
         </p>
         <p> In the reign of <a href="people.html#ElizabethIQueenofEngland">queen
               						Elizabeth</a>, we had the once famous romance, <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#SidneyPhilip">Sidney</a>'s
               							Arcadia</span>, of the pastoral heroic kind. It is a book
            					that all have heard of, some few possess, but nobody reads. 
         </p>
         <p> From that period, to the middle of the reign of <a href="people.html#GeorgeIIKingofGreatBritain">George II</a>, we had
            					tales of various kinds, but scarcely one that is read at present, and, I
            					believe, not any except that ingenious allegory, <span class="italics">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>, that was known out of
            					England. We had poets and philosophers long before we attained excellence in
            the
            					lighter kinds of prosaic composition. <a href="people.html#HarringtonJames">Harrington</a>'s <span class="italics">Oceana</span>
            					is political, and will grievously disappoint those who seek amusement in it.
            The
            							<span class="italics">Atalantis</span> of <a href="people.html#ManleyMrs">Mrs. Manly</a> lives only in that line of
            						<a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a> which promises it
            					immortality: </p>
            <blockquote>
               <table>
                  <tr>
                     <td><span class="l">As long as Atalantis shall be read.<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span></span></td>
                  </tr>
               </table>
            </blockquote><p class="pnoindent"> It was, like Astrea, filled with fashionable
            					scandal. <a href="people.html#BehnAphra">Mrs. Behn</a>'s novels were
            					licentious: they are also extinct. Till the middle of the last century,
            					theatrical productions and poetry made a greater part of polite reading than
            					novels, which had not attained either elegance or nice discrimination of
            					characters; some maritime or some love adventure were all they aimed at. The
            					ladies' library, described in the Spectator, contains
            						"the Grand Cyrus, with a pin stuck in one of the leaves,
            					and Clelia, which opened of itself in the place that describes
            					two lovers in a bower;"<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span> but there does not occur either there,
            					or, I believe, in any other part of the work, the name of one English novel,
            the
            						Atalantis excepted. Plays are often mentioned as a favourite
            					and dangerous part of ladies' reading. 
         </p>
         <p> The first author who distinguished himself by natural painting was that truly
            					original genius <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a>; and if from
            					any one <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> caught his
            					peculiar manner of writing, to him it must be traced, whose <span class="italics">Robinson Crusoe</span> and <span class="italics">Family Instructor</span>, the latter
            					consisting of domestic dialogues, he must have read in his youth. Both were
            					accurate describers, minute and circumstantial, but the minuteness of <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> was displayed in things, and
            					that of <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> in persons
            					and sentiments. No one knew, like <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De
               						Foe</a>, to give to fiction the air of truth, by an accumulation of
            					circumstance, and a natural style of narration, unless, indeed, he were rivalled
            					by <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, in his
            						Gulliver and John Bull. <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> wrote also other tales, which I have not seen: they do not
            					appear to have attained much celebrity. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> was the man who was
            					born to introduce a new kind of moral painting: he drew equally from nature and
            					from his own thoughts. From the world about him he took incidents, manners, and
            					general character; and from his own imagination he copied that sublime of
            					virtue, which charms us in <a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a>, and that sublime of passion, which subdues us in <a href="people.html#Clementina">Clementina</a>. That kind of fictitious
            					writing, of which he has set the example, disclaims all aid from giants or
            					genii. The moated castle gives place to a modern parlour; the princess and her
            					pages to a lady and her domestics, or even to a rustic maid, without birth or
            					fortune; we are not called on to wonder at improbable events, but to be moved
            by
            					natural passions, and impressed by salutary maxims. The pathos of the story,
            and
            					the dignity of the sentiments, interest and </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 697]</p><p class="pnoindent">charm us; simplicity is
            					warned, vice rebuked; and from the perusal of a fiction we rise better prepared
            					to meet calamity with firmness, and to perform our respective parts on the great
            					theatre of life. It was the high and just praise given by our great critic, Dr.
            						<a href="#JohnsonSamuel">Johnson</a>, to this author, that he had
            					enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the passions to move at the
            					command of virtue.<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> The novelist has, indeed, all the advantage of
            					the preacher in introducing useful maxims and sentiments of virtue; an advantage
            					which <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> made large use
            					of; and he has besides the power of impressing them upon the heart, through the
            					best sensibilities of our nature. <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a> prided himself on being a moral and religious writer; and,
            					as <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> did before him, he
            					professed to take under his particular protection that sex which is supposed
            to
            					be the most open to good or evil impressions, whose inexperience most requires
            					cautionary precepts, and whose sensibilities it is most important to secure
            					against a wrong direction. The manner of this captivating writer was also new.
            
         </p>
         <p> There are three modes of carrying on a story: the narrative, or epic, as it may
            					be called; in this the author himself relates the whole adventure: this is the
            					manner of <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, in his Don
            						Quixote, and of <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>, in his Tom Jones. It is the most common way.
            					The author, like the muse, is supposed to know every thing; he can reveal the
            					secret springs of actions, and let us into events in his own time and manner.
            He
            					can be concise or diffuse, according as the different parts of his story require
            					it. He can indulge, as <a href="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</a>
            					does, in digressions and reflections, and thus deliver sentiments, and display
            					knowledge, which would not properly belong to any of the characters. But his
            					narration will not be lively, except he frequently drops himself, and runs into
            					dialogue: all good writers, therefore, have thrown as much as possible of the
            					dramatic into their narrative. <a href="people.html#BurneyFanny">Mad.
               						d' Arblay</a> has done this so successfully, that we have as clear an
            					idea, not only of the sentiments, but the manner of expression of her different
            					personages, as if we took it from the scenes of a play.
         </p>
         <p> Another mode is that of memoirs, where the hero of the adventure relates his own
            					story. <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</a></span>, in his <span class="italics">Roderick
               							Random</span>, and <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</a></span>, in his
            							<span class="italics">Vicar of Wakefield</span>, have
            					adopted this mode: it confines the author's style, which ought to be,
            					though it is not always, suited to the capacity and education of the imaginary
            					narrator. It has the warmth and interest a person may be supposed to feel in
            					relating his own concerns, and he can more gracefully dwell upon minute
            					circumstances. It has a greater air of truth, and it seems to account for the
            					communication to the public. The author, it is true, knows every thing; but,
            					when the secret recesses of the heart are to be laid open, we can hear no one
            					with so much pleasure as the actor himself. <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Marivaux">Marivaux</a></span>, a contemporary of
            						<a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>, has put the
            					history of Marianne into her own mouth, and we are amused to hear her dwell on
            					little touches, which are almost too trivial to be noticed by any body but
            					herself. 
         </p>
         <p> But what the hero cannot say, the author cannot tell, nor can it be rendered
            					probable, that a very circumstantial narrative should be given by a person,
            					perhaps at the close of a long life, of conversations that have happened at the
            					beginning of it. The author has always two characters to support, and has to
            					consider how his hero felt during his adventures, and how it is natural he
            					should feel when only relating them; at a period, perhaps, when curiosity is
            					extinct, passions cool, and when, at any rate, the suspenses which kept pace
            					with them are over. This seems, therefore, the least perfect mode of any.
         </p>
         <p> A third way is that of epistola-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 698]</p><p class="pnoindent">ry correspondence, carried on
            					between the persons of the story.... This is the form used by <a href="people.html#RichardsonSamuel">Richardson</a>, and many others
            					after, but by none before him. He seems to have been led to it by some
            					circumstances in his early youth. This method unites the advantages of the other
            					two; it gives the feelings of the moment, as the writers felt them at the
            					moment. It allows a pleasing variety of style, if the author has sufficient
            					command of language to assume it. It makes the work dramatic, since all the
            					characters speak in their own persons. It accounts for chasms in the story, by
            					the probable omission or loss of letters. It is inconsistent with a rapid style,
            					but gives room for the graceful introduction of remarks and sentiments, or
            					almost any kind of digressive matter. But, on the other hand, it is highly
            					incredible; it is the <span class="italics">most natural</span> and the <span class="italics">least probable</span> way of telling a story. That
            					letters should be written at all times, and upon every occasion in life, that
            					those letters should be preserved, and altogether form a connected story, it
            					requires much art to render probable. It introduces the inconvenience so much
            					felt in dramatic writing, for want of a narrator; the necessity of having an
            					insipid confidant to tell those circumstances to, that an author can introduce
            					in no other way. It obliges a man to tell of himself, what shame or modesty
            					would suffer no man to tell; and when a long conversation is repeated, supposes
            					a memory more exact than is generally found. Artificial as it is, still it
            					enables an author to assume, in a lively manner, the hopes, and fears, and
            					passions, and to imitate the peculiar way of thinking and speaking of his
            					characters, and has been adopted by many, both at home and abroad, especially
            by
            					the French writers; their language, perhaps, being particularly suited to the
            					epistolary style, and <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Rousseau</a></span> himself, in
            					his <span class="italics">Nouvelle Heloise</span>, has followed
            					the steps of our countryman.
