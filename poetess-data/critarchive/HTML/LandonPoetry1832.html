         <p><span class="largest">I</span><span class="smcaps">t</span> is curious to
            					observe how little one period resembles another. Centuries are the children of
            					one mighty family, but there is no family-likeness between them. We ourselves
            					are standing on the threshold of a new era, and we are already hastening to make
            					as wide a space, mark as vast a difference as possible, between our own age and
            					its predecessor. Whatever follies we may go back upon, whatever opinions we may
            					re-adopt, they are never those which have gone <span class="italics">immediately</span> before us. Already there is a wide gulph between the last
            					century and the present. In religion, in philosophy, in politics, in manners,
            					there has passed a great change; but in none has been worked a greater change
            					than in poetry, whether as it regards the art itself, or the general feeling
            					towards it. The decline and fall of that Roman empire of the mind seems now
            					advanced as an historical fact; while we are equally ready to admit that some
            					twenty years since the republic was in its plenitude of power. In the meantime
            a
            					new set of aspirants have arisen, and a new set of opinions are to be won. But
            					it is from the past that we best judge of the present; and perhaps we shall more
            					accurately say what poetry is by referring to what it has been.
         </p>
         <p>Poetry in every country has had its origin in three sources, connected with the
            					strongest feelings belonging to the human mind—Religion, War, and Love.
            					The mysteries of the present; the still greater mysteries of the future; the
            					confession of some superior power so deeply felt; higher impulses speaking so
            					strongly of some spiritual influence of a purer order than those of our common
            					wants and wishes;—these all found words and existence in poetry. The
            					vainest fictions of mythology were the strongest possible evidence how necessary
            					to the ignorance of humanity was the belief of a superior power; so entire was
            					the interior conviction, that sooner than believe in nothing no belief was too
            					absurd for adoption. The imagination, which is the source of poetry, has in
            					every country been the beginning as well as the ornament of civilization. It
            					civilizes because it refines. A general view of its influence in the various
            					quarters of the globe will place this in the most striking point of view.
         </p>
         <p>Africa is the least civilized quarter of the globe, not so much from its savage
            					as from its apathetic state; one could almost believe that it had been formed
            					from the dregs of the other parts. Now, the distinguishing mark of its
            					deficiency in that soil of mind wherewith the intellect works, is its total want
            					of imagination. It is the only great portion of the world which is not
            					emphatically made known to us by its own peculiar religion. Her mythology was
            					the earthly immortality of Greece. Greece is indelibly linked with the idea of
            					civilization; but all those fine and graceful beliefs which made its springs
            					holy places, and haunted the fragrant life of every flower and leaf, were the
            					creations of earliest time. Look from thence to the fierce regions of the
            					North,—how full is the Scandinavian faith of the wild and wonderful! or to
            					the East, how gorgeous their tales of enchantment, with their delicate Peris,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> and the fallen and fearful
            					spirits in their subterranean caverns!—again, the faith of Brahma, with
            					its thousand deities. Or, to cross the wide Atlantic, there are the vestiges
            of
            					a terrible creed yet</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 467]</p><p class="pnoindent">touched with something of spiritual loveliness,
            					in their singing-birds bringing tidings of the departed, and in the green
            					hunting-grounds which made their future hope. Each and all these creeds are the
            					work and wonder of the imagination—but in these Africa has no part. No
            					august belief fills with beauty or terror the depths of her forests, and no
            					fallen temple makes its site sacred though in ruins. Her creeds have neither
            					beauty nor grandeur. The Devil is their principal Deity, and their devotion is
            					born of physical fear. Other nations have had their various faiths, created and
            					coloured by the scenes which gave them birth. The religion of Greece was
            					beautiful as her own myrtle and olive groves. The Scandinavian was like its own
            					wild mountains and snowy wastes, with just gleams of beauty from its starry
            					nights and meteors. The Arabian was glowing and magnificent as the summer earth
            					and radiant sky of its believers; while that of the American Indian was terrible
            					as the huge serpents and the interminable forests which gave shelter to its
            					mysteries. But in Africa the sunny sky, the noble rivers, the woods, splendid
            in
            					size and foliage, have been without their wonted effect. Slaves from the
            					earliest period, the very superstitions of her sable sons are mean fears caught
            					from their masters; all about them is earthly, utterly unredeemed by those
            					spiritual awakenings which are as lights from another world. We might believe
            					that some great original curse has been said over them, and that they are given
            					over into the hand of man and not of God. And in simple truth that curse has
            					been slavery. The Helots<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> even of Greece were uninspired. "A slave cannot
            					be eloquent," said <a href="people.html#Longinus">Longinus</a><span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span>; nor poetical either—the wells of
            					his enthusiasm are dried up. What some ancient writer says of iron may be
            					applied to Poetry—its use is the first step to civilization, and
            					civilization is freedom.
         </p>
         <p>Next to Religion War was the great source of poetry; and the deeds of the brave
            					were sung in that spirit of encouragement which one man will ever receive from
            					the praise bestowed on the deeds of another, when he meditates similar
            					achievements of his own. And here we may be permitted a few words on what we
            					cannot but consider an unjust and erroneous opinion, now much insisted
            					upon,—that poets and conquerors have been equal enemies of the human
            					race—the one but acting what the other praised; and that the sin of
            					encouragement was equal, if not greater, than that of commission. In answer to
            					this we must observe that it is not fair to judge of former actions by our
            					present standard. Our first view of society is always the same: we see the human
            					race dwelling in small dispersed sets, with rude habits, the results of
            					hardships and of dangers. A more favourable situation, or, more commonly, the
            					influence of some superior mind, which from the wonderful effects produced by
            a
            					single man is often a nation's history: these or similar causes first
            					placed some of the tribes in positions of comparative comfort and advancement.
            					This position would of course be envied by their savage and starving neighbours,
            					who would consider brute force the only means of sharing their advantages.
            					Single motives never last: ambition, aggrandisement, conquest with a view to
            					security, soon gave a thousand motives to warfare that had originally began in
            					want and self-defence. It has required centuries so to consolidate kingdoms that
            					now a breathing space is allowed for reflection on the sin of sacrificing
            					man's most valuable possession—life. But what part has the poet taken
            					in these scenes of bloodshed? One certainly of amelioration. If he has sung of
            						con-</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 468]</p><p class="pnoindent">querors, the qualities held up to admiration were those of magnanimity and
            					generosity. He has spoken of the love of liberty as holding light the love of
            					life; and the highest eulogium of a warrior was that he died in defence of his
            					native country. But to give our assertion the support of an
            					example—Perhaps the spirit which animates, the desire which excites, the
            					power which supports, a conqueror, were never more entirely personified than
            in
            						<a href="people.html#Xerxes">Xerxes</a>. He possessed to the utmost
            					that grasping ambition, that carelessness of human blood, which characterize
            the
            					mere conqueror; yet with all the purple pomp of his power, we are not aware of
            					his having been held up otherwise than in reprobation, while the whole world
            has
            					been filled with the fame of his brave opposers; and the names of those who fell
            					at Marathon are still the watchwords of freedom. Again, in the days of chivalry,
            					what were the qualities the minstrel lauded in the knight?—his valour,
            					certainly, but still more his courtesy, his protection of the weak against the
            					strong, his devotion, his truth;—till the "ungentle knight" was
            					almost as much a phrase of disgrace as that of the "recreant."
         </p>
         <p>Love was the third great fountain of poetry's inspiration; and who that has
            					ever loved will deny the necessity of a language, beyond the working-day tongue
            					of our ordinary run of hopes and fears, to express feelings which have so little
            					in common with them. What has been the most popular love-poetry in all
            					countries?—that which gave expression to its spiritual and better
            					part—constancy kept like a holy thing—blessings on the beloved one,
            					though in that blessing we have ourselves no share; or sad and affectionate
            					regrets in whose communion our own nature grows more kindly from its sympathy.
            					We are always the better for entering into other’s sorrow or other's
            					joy.
         </p>
         <p>The whole origin and use of poetry may be expressed in a few brief words: it
            					originates in that idea of superior beauty and excellence inherent in every
            					nature—and it is employed to keep that idea alive; and the very belief in
            					excellence is one cause of its existence. When we speak of poetry as the
            					fountain whence youth draws enthusiasm for its hopes,—where the warrior
            					strengthens his courage, and the lover his faith,—the treasury where the
            					noblest thoughts are garnered,—the archives where the noblest deeds are
            					recorded,—we but express an old belief. One of our great reviews—the
            						"<a href="people.html#WestminsterReview">Westminster</a>"<span class="sup"></span>—in
            					speaking of the fine arts, &amp;c. says, "The aristocracy do well to
            					encourage poetry: it is by fiction themselves exist—and what is poetry but
            						fiction?"<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> fiction; its merit and its power lie alike in its
            					truth: to one heart the aspiring and elevated will come home; to another the
            					simple and natural: the keynote to one will be the voice of memory, which brings
            					back young affections—early confidence,—hill and valley yet glad
            					with the buoyant step which once past over them,—flowers thrice lovely
            					from thoughts indelibly associated with their leaf or breath: such as these are
            					touched by all that restores, while it recalls, days whose enjoyment would have
            					been happiness, could they but have had the knowledge of experience without its
            					weariness. To another, poetry will be a vision and a delight, because the virtue
            					of which he dreams is there realized—and because the "love which his
            					spirit has painted"<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> is to be found in its pages. But in each and all cases the
            					deep well of sympathy is only to be found when the hazel rod is poised by the
            					hand of truth. And, till some moral steam is discovered as potent as that now
            so
            					active in the physical</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 469]</p><p class="pnoindent">world, vain will be the effort to regulate
            					mankind like machinery: there will ever be spiritual awakenings, and deep and
            					tender thoughts, to turn away from the hurry and highways of life, and whose
            					place of refuge will still be the green paths and pleasant waters of poesy. That
            					tribes of worse than idle followers have crowded the temple, and cast the dust
            					they brought around the soiled altar,—that many have profaned their high
            					gift to base use—that poetry has often turned aside from its divine origin
            					and diviner end,—is what must be equally admitted and lamented; but who
            					will deny that our best and most popular (indeed in this case best and popular
            					are equivalent terms) poetry makes its appeal to the higher and better feelings
            					of our nature, and not a poet but owes his fame to that which best deserves it?
            					What a code of pure and beautiful morality, applicable to almost every
            					circumstance, might be drawn from <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</a>!
         </p>
         <p>The influence of poetry has two eras,—first as it tends to civilize;
            					secondly as it tends to prevent that very civilization from growing too cold
            and
            					too selfish. Its first is its period of action; its second is that of feeling
            					and reflection: it is that second period which at present exists. On the mere
            					principle of utility, in our wide and weary world, with its many sorrows and
            					more cares, how anxiously we ought to keep open every source of happiness! and
            					who among us does not recollect some hour when a favourite poet spread before
            us
            					a page like that of a magician's; when some expression has seemed like the
            					very echo of our feelings; how often and with what a sensation of pleasure have
            					long-remembered passages sprang to our lips; how every natural beauty has caught
            					a fresh charm from being linked with some associate verse! Who that has these
            or
            					similar recollections but would keep the ear open, and the heart alive, to the
            					"song that lightens the languid way!"<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p>Why one age should be more productive in poetry than another is one of those
            					questions—a calculation of the mental longitude—likely to remain
            					unanswered. That peculiar circumstances do not create the poet is proved by the
            					fact, that only one individual is so affected: if it were mere circumstance,
            it
            					would affect alike all who are brought within its contact. What confirmation
            of
            					this theory (if theory it be) is to be found in the history of all
            					poets!—where are we to seek the cause which made them such, if not in
            					their own minds? We daily see men living amid beautiful scenery; and scenery
            is
            					much dwelt upon the advocates of circumstance. Switzerland is a most beautiful
            					country, yet what great poet has it ever produced? The spirit which in ancient
            					days peopled grove and mountain with Dryad and Oread,<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span> or, in modern
            					times, with associations, must be in him who sees, not in the object seen. How
            					many there are, leading a life of literary leisure, living in a romantic
            					country, and writing poetry all their days, who yet go down to their
            					unremembered graves no more poets than if they had never turned a stanza! While,
            					on the other hand, we see men with every obstacle before them, with little
            					leisure and less encouragement, yet force their upward way, make their voice
            					heard, and leave their memory in imperishable song. Take <a href="people.html#BurnsRobert">Burns</a> for an example:
            					much stress has been laid on the legendary ballads he was accustomed to hear
            					from infancy; but if these were so potent, why did they not inspire his brother
            					as well as himself? <a href="people.html#BurnsGilbert">Mr. Gilbert
               							Burns</a> is recorded, by every biographer, to have been a
            					sensible, and even a superior man; he dwelt in the same country—he heard
            					the same songs—why was he not a poet too? There can be but one</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 470]</p><p class="pnoindent"> answer,—there was not that inherent quality in his mind which there was
            					in his brother's. Many young men are born to a higher name than
            					fortune—many spend their youth amid the most exciting scenes—yet why
            					do none of these turn out a <a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</a>, but for some innate first cause? What made
            						<a href="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</a> in old
            					age,—in sickness, in poverty—depressed by all that would have
            					weighed to the very dust an ordinary man—without one of man's
            					ordinary encouragements,—what could have made him turn to the future as to
            					a home, collect his glorious energies, and finish a work, the noblest aid ever
            					given to the immortality of a language? What, but that indefinable spirit, whose
            					enthusiasm is nature's own gift to the poet. <span class="italics">Poeta
               						nascitur non fit</span><span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> is, like many other old truths, the very
            					truth after all.
         </p>
         <p>We cannot but consider that, though some be still among us, our own great poets
            					belong to another age. Their fame is established, and their horde of imitators
            					have dispersed; those wearying followers who, to use the happy expression of
            a
            					contemporary writer, "think that breaking the string is bending the bow of
            						<a href="people.html#Ulysses">Ulysses</a>." We hear
            					daily complaints of the want of present taste and talent for poetry: we are more
            					prepared to admit the latter than the former. In the most sterile times of the
            					imagination, love of poetry has never been lacking; the taste may have been bad,
            					but still the taste existed. <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> truly says, "that, with the young,
            					poetry is a passion;"<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> and there will always be
            					youth in the world to indulge the hopes, and feel the warm and fresh emotions,
            					which their fathers have found to be vain, or have utterly exhausted. To these,
            					poetry will ever be a natural language; and it is the young who make the
            					reputation of a poet. We soon lose that keen delight, which marvels if others
            					share not in it: the faculty of appreciation is the first which leaves us. It
            is
            					tact rather than feeling which enables experience to foresee the popularity of
            a
            					new poet. As to the alleged want of taste, we only refer to the editions of
            					established authors which still find purchasers: one has just appeared of <a href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>, another of <a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</a>. With what
            					enthusiasm do some set up <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> for an idol, and others <a href="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</a>! But this taste
            					is quite another feeling to that which creates; and the little now written
            					possesses beauty not originality. The writers do not set their own mark on their
            					property: one might have put forth the work of the other, or it might be that
            of
            					their predecessors. This was not the case some few years ago. Who could have
            					mistaken the picturesque and chivalric pages of <a href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> for the
            					impassioned one of <a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</a>? or who could for a moment have hesitated as to
            					whether a poem was marked with the actual and benevolent philosophy of <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, or the
            					beautiful but ideal theory of <a href="people.html#ShelleyPercy">Shelley</a>? We are now producing no great or original
            					(the words are synonymous) poet. We have graceful singing in the bower, but no
            					voice that startles us into wonder, and hurries us forth to see whose trumpet
            is
            					awakening the land. We know that when the snow has long lain, warming and
            					fertilizing the ground, and when the late summer comes, hot and clear, the rich
            					harvest will be abundant under such genial influences. Perhaps poetry too may
            					have its atmosphere; and a long cold winter may be needed for its glad and
            					glorious summer. The soil of song, like that of earth, may need rest for
            					renewal. Again we repeat, that though the taste be not, the spirit of the day
            					is, adverse to the production of poetry. Selfishness is its principle,
            					indifference its affectation, and ridicule its commonplace. We allow no appeals
            					save to our reason, or to our fear </p>

            					convinced or sneered into things. Neither calculation nor sarcasm are the
            					elements for poetry. A remark made by <a href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> to one of his great compeers shows how he knew
            					the age in which he was fated to end his glorious
            					career:—"Ah—it is well that we have made our reputation!"
            					The personal is the destroyer of the spiritual; and to the former everything
            is
            					now referred. We talk of the author's self more than his works, and we know
            					his name rather than his writings. There is a base macadamizing spirit in
            					literature; we seek to level all the high places of old. But till we can deny
