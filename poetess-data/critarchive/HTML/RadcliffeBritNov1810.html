            entitles its author to praise, a greater distinction is due to those which stand
            at the head of a class; and such are undoubtedly the novels of <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</a>,—which exhibit
            a genius of no common stamp. She seems to scorn to move those passions which
            form the interest of common novels: she alarms the soul with terror; agitates it
            with suspense, prolonged and wrought up to the most intense feeling, by
            mysterious hints and obscure intimations of unseen danger. The scenery of her
            tales is in "time-shook towers,"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> vast uninhabited castles, winding stair-cases, long
            echoing aisles; or, if abroad, lonely heaths, gloomy forests, and abrupt
            precipices, the haunt of banditti;—the canvass and the figures of <a href="people.html#RosaSalvatore">Salvator Rosa</a>. Her living
            characters correspond to the scenery:—their wicked projects are dark,
            singular, atrocious. They are not of English growth; their guilt is tinged with
            a darker hue than that of the bad and profligate characters we see in the world
            about us; they seem almost to belong to an unearthly sphere of powerful
            mischief. But to the terror </p>

            this writer has had the art to unite another, and possibly a stronger feeling.
            There is, perhaps, in every breast at all susceptible of the influence of
            imagination, the germ of a certain superstitious dread of the world unknown,
            which easily suggests the ideas of commerce with it. Solitude, darkness,
            low-whispered sounds, obscure glimpses of objects, flitting forms, tend to raise
            in the mind that thrilling, mysterious terror, which has for its object the
            "powers unseen and mightier far than we."<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> But these
            ideas are suggested only; for it is the peculiar management of this author,
            that, though she gives, as it were, a glimpse of the world of terrible shadows,
            she yet stops short of any thing really supernatural: for all the strange and
            alarming circumstances brought forward in the narrative are explained in the
            winding up of the story by natural causes; but in the mean time the reader has
            felt their full impression.

         <p>The first production of this lady, in which her peculiar genius was strikingly
            developed, is <span class="italics">The Romance of the
               Forest</span>, and in some respects it is perhaps the best.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> It turns upon
            the machinations of a profligate villain and his agent against an amiable and
            unprotected girl, whose birth and fortunes have been involved in obscurity by
            crime and perfidy. The character of La Motte, the agent, is drawn with spirit.
            He is represented as weak and timid, gloomy and arbitrary in his family, drawn
            by extravagance into vice and atrocious actions; capable of remorse, but not
            capable of withstanding temptation. There is a </p>

            far more nature and truth than the admired scene between King John and
            Hubert, in which the writer's imagination has led him
            rather to represent the action to which the king is endeavouring to work his
            instrument, as it would be seen by a person who had a great horror of its guilt,
            than in the manner in which he ought to represent it in order to win him to his

            referred to, on the other hand, the Marquis, whose aim is to tempt La Motte to
            the commission of murder, begins by attempting to lower his sense of virtue, by
            representing it as the effect of prejudices imbibed in early youth; reminds him
            that in many countries the stiletto is resorted to without scruple; treats as
            trivial his former deviations from integrity; and, by lulling his conscience and
            awakening his cupidity, draws him to his purpose.

         <p> There are many situations in this novel which strike strongly upon the
            imagination. Who can read without a shudder, that Adeline in her lonely chamber
            at the abbey hardly dared to lift her eyes to the glass, lest she should see
            another face than her own reflected from it? or who does not sympathize with her
            feelings, when, thinking she has effected her escape with Peter, she hears a
            strange voice, and finds herself on horseback in a dark night carried away by an
            unknown ruffian?
         </p>
         <p> The next work which proceeded from <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.
               Radcliffe</a>'s pen was <span class="italics">The Mysteries
               of Udolpho</span>. Similar to the former in the turn of its
            incidents, and the nature of the feelings it is meant to excite, it abounds
            still more with instances of mysterious and terrific appearances, but has
            perhaps less of character, and a more imperfect story. It has been the aim in
            this work to assemble appearances of the most impressive kind, which continually
            present the idea of supernatural agency, but which are at length accounted for
            by natural means. They are not always, however, <span class="italics">well</span> accounted for; and the mind experiences a sort of disappointment
            and shame at having felt so much from appearances which had nothing in them
            beyond "this visible diurnal sphere."<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> The moving of the pall in the funereal chamber is of
            this nature. The curtain which no one dares to undraw, interests us strongly; we
            feel the utmost stings and throbs of curiosity; but we have been affected so
            repeatedly, the suspense has been so long protracted, and expectation raised so
            high, that no ex-</p>

            equal the vague shapings of our imagination.
         </p>
         <p> The story of <span class="italics">Udolpho</span> is more
            complicated and perplexed than that of <span class="italics">The
               Romance of the Forest</span><span class="italics">;</span> but it
            turns, like that, on the terrors and dangers of a young lady confined in a
            castle. The character of her oppressor, Montoni, is less distinctly marked than
            that of La Motte; and it is a fault in the story, that its unravelling depends
            but little on the circumstances that have previously engaged our attention.
            Another castle is introduced; wonders are multiplied upon us; and the interest
            we had felt in the castle of Udolpho in the Appenines, is suddenly transferred
            to Chateau le Blanc among the Pyrenees.
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">The Mysteries of Udolpho</span> is the
            most popular of this author's performances, and as such has been chosen for
            this Selection; but perhaps it is exceeded in strength by her next publication,
            <span class="italics">The Sicilian</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> Nothing can be finer than the
            opening of this story. An Englishman on his travels, walking through a church,
            sees a dark figure stealing along the aisles. He is informed that he is an
            assassin. On expressing his astonishment that he should find shelter there, he
            is told that such adventures are common in Italy. His companion then points to a
            confessional in an obscure aisle of the church. "There," says he,
            "in that cell, such a tale of horror was once poured into the ear of a
            priest as overwhelmed him with astonishment, nor was the secret ever
            disclosed." This prelude, like the tuning of an instrument by a skilful
            hand, has the effect of producing at once in the mind a tone of feeling cor-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent">respondent to the future story. In this, as in the former
            productions, the curiosity of the reader is kept upon the stretch by mystery and
            wonder. The author seems perfectly to understand that obscurity, as <a href="people.html#BurkeEdmund">Burke</a> has asserted, is a strong
            ingredient in the sublime:—a face shrowded in a cowl; a narrative suddenly
            suspended; deep guilt half revealed; the untold secrets of a prison-house; the
            terrific shape, "if shape it might be called, that shape had none
            distinguishable;"—all these affect the mind more powerfully than any
            regular or distinct images of danger or of woe.<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> But this novel has also high merit in the character of Schedoni, which is
            strikingly drawn, as is his personal appearance. "His figure," says
            the author, "was striking, but not so from grace. It was tall, and though
            extremely thin, his limbs were large and uncouth; and as he stalked along,
            wrapped in the black garments of his order, there was something terrible in his
            air, something almost superhuman. His cowl too, as it threw a shade over the
            livid paleness of his face, increased its severe character, and gave an effect
            to his large melancholy eye which approached to horror. His physiognomy bore the
            trace of many passions, which seemed to have fixed the features they no longer
            animated. His eyes were so piercing that they seemed to penetrate with a single
            glance into the hearts of men, and to read their most secret thoughts; few
            persons could support their scrutiny, or even endure to meet them twice." A
            striking figure for the painter to transfer to the canvass; perhaps some </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">picture might originally have suggested it. The scene where this
            singular character is on the point of murdering his own daughter, as she then
            appears to be, is truly tragical, and wrought up with great strength and pathos.
            It is impossible not to be interested in the situation of Ellen, in the convent,
            when her lamp goes out while she is reading a paper on which her fate depends;
            and again when, in making her escape, she has just got to the end of the long
            vaulted passage, and finds the door locked, and herself betrayed. The scenes of
            the Inquisition are too much protracted, and awaken more curiosity than they
            fully gratify; perhaps than any story can gratify.
         </p>
         <p> In novels of this kind, where the strong charm of suspense and mystery is
            employed, we hurry through with suspended breath, and in a kind of agony of
            expectation; but when we are come to the end of the story, the charm is
            dissolved, we have no wish to read it again; we do not recur to it as we do to
            the characters of Western in <span class="italics">Tom
               Jones</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> or the Harrels in <span class="italics">Cecilia;</span><span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> the interest is painfully strong while we
            read, and when once we have read it, it is nothing; we are ashamed of our
            feelings, and do not wish to recall them.
         </p>
         <p> There are beauties in <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.
               Radcliffe</a>'s volumes, which would perhaps have more effect if our
            curiosity were less excited,—for her descriptions are rich and
            picturesque. Switzerland, the south of France, Venice, the valleys of Piedmont,
            the bridge, the cataract, and especially the charming bay of Naples, the dances
            of the peasants, with the vine-dressers and the fishermen, </p>

            employed her pencil. Though love is but of a secondary interest in her story,
            there is a good deal of tenderness in the parting scenes between Emily and
            Valancourt in <span class="italics">The Mysteries of
               Udolpho</span>, when she dismisses him, who is still the object of her
            tenderness, on account of his irregularities.

         <p> It ought not to be forgotten that there are many elegant pieces of poetry
            interspersed through the volumes of <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs.

            and fanciful, the <span class="italics">Song to a Spirit</span>,
            and <span class="italics">The Sea Nymph</span>, "Down down

            true lovers of poetry are almost apt to regret its being brought in as an
            accompaniment to narrative, where it is generally neglected; for not one in a
            hundred, of those who read and can judge of novels, are at all able to
            appreciate the merits of a copy of verses, and the common reader is always
            impatient to get on with the story.

            Radcliffe's third. While Barbauld might almost be justified in
            ignoring Radcliffe's first, <span class="italics">The
               Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne</span> (1789), readers
            usually regard the 1790 <span class="italics">A Sicilian
               Romance</span> as a work of merit. Since Barbauld seems to
            confuse the title of <span class="italics">A Sicilian
               Romance</span> with that of <span class="italics">The Italian</span> (see below),
            perhaps this confusion explains the omission. <a href="#back4">Back</a></p>

            helped bring new respectability to Gothic literature and formed a
            standard in British aesthetics through the Romantic period and beyond.
            The quotation from <a href="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</a>'s description of Death in <span class="italics">Paradise Lost</span> (Bk. II, 667)
            serves Burke as one of the most powerful examples of the effect of
            obscurity in producing ideas of the sublime. <a href="#back8">Back</a></p>
