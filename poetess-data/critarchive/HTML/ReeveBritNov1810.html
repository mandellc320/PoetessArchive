               Baron,</span> though a novel of but a moderate degree of merit,
            has been always a great favourite with the novel-reading public, and as such is
            here introduced; for, though subsequent publications of more elegance and more
            invention have caused it to slide down from the place it once held; it is still
            generally agreeable to young people who are fond of the serious and the
            wonderful; and as it inspires none but noble and proper sentiments, it can do
            them no harm, except it should make them afraid to go up stairs to bed, by
            themselves, on a winter's night. 
         </p>
         <p> This work is something of a medium between the old romance and the modern novel.
            The scene is placed in England, in the reigns of Henry the Fifth and Sixth; the
            manners such as they are supposed to be in chivalrous times. The story is simple
            and well connected: it turns upon the discovery of a murder, and the consequent
            restoration of an heir to his title and estate. The opening is
            striking:—Sir Philip, the old baron, is a fine character; the man- </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> ners and dialogue of the peasants are sufficiently well executed. 
         </p>
         <p> With regard to the wonderful part of the story, the writer does not, like <a href="people.html#WalpoleHorace">the author of <span class="italics">The Castle of Otranto</span></a>, give unlimited
            play to her imagination in the supernatural means she employs. She says in her
            preface, "We can conceive and allow for the appearance of a ghost."
            The appearances she has introduced are therefore such as, till lately, coincided
            with the belief, perhaps, of the generality of readers; haunted rooms, presaging
            dreams, groans, clanking of chains, and apparitions of murdered persons; such
            ornaments as, the author seems to think, come within the verge—the utmost
            verge of probability; and to those whose minds are thus properly imbued, the
            story will be striking. At present we should require these appearances to be
            more artful, or more singular. 
         </p>
         <p> The chief fault of it is, that we foresee the conclusion before we have read
            twenty pages: but this is not the case with the young and unpractised reader;
            and those who have read <span class="italics">The Old English
               Baron</span> at an early time of life are generally conscious at a
            much later period of the impression it once made upon their youthful fancy.

         <p><a href="people.html#ReeveClara">Mrs. Clara Reeve</a>, the author, wrote a
            variety of novels with different success: her last was <span class="italics">Memoirs of Sir Roger de Clarendon, natural Son of <a href="people.html#EdwardPrinceofWales">Edward the Black

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> of the splendid reign of <a href="people.html#EdwardIIIKingofEngland">Edward the Third</a>, joined
            to that high sense of virtue supposed to belong to the chivalrous times, but for
            which they are entirely indebted to the writers of romance. <a href="people.html#ReeveClara">Mrs. Reeve</a> also translated, from the
            Latin, <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#BarclayJohn">Barclay</a>'s Argenis and Parthenis</span>, and
            published it under the title of <span class="italics">The
               Phœnix</span>, and she wrote <span class="italics">The Progress of Romance</span>; an account of works of
            fiction, interspersed with reflections, in dialogue.

         <p> This lady died at Ipswich, in Jan. 1808, at the age of seventy; in very narrow
            circumstances, notwithstanding she had written so much. She thus expresses
            herself on some occasion in a letter to a friend: "I have been all my life
            straitened in my circumstances, and used my pen to support a scanty
            establishment; yet, to the best of my knowledge, I have drawn it on the side of
            truth, virtue and morality." <span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span></p>
