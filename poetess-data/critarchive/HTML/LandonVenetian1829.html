            anxiety for public favour, are pleas usually urged by the youthful writer: may
            I, while venturing for the first time to speak of myself, be permitted to say
            they far more truly belong to one who has had experience of both praise and
            censure. The feelings which attended the publication of the
            "Improvisatrice"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> are very different from those that accompany the
            present volume. I believe I <span class="italics">then</span> felt

            and the timidity which apprehended the verdict of others, is now deepened by
            distrust of my own powers. Or, to claim my poetical privilege, and express my
            meaning by a simile, I should say, I am no longer one who springs forward in the
            mere energy of exercise and enjoyment; but rather like the Olympian racer, who
            strains his utmost vigour, with the distant goal and crown in view. I have
            devoted my whole life to one object: in society I have but sought the material
            for solitude. I can imagine but one interest in existence,—that which has
            filled my past, and haunts my future,—the perhaps vain desire, when</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">I am nothing, of leaving one of those memories at once a good and a
            glory. Believing as I do in the great and excellent influence of poetry, may I
            hazard the expression of what I have myself sometimes trusted to do? A
            highly-cultivated state of society must ever have for concomitant evils, that
            selfishness, the result of indolent indulgence; and that heartlessness attendant
            on refinement, which too often hardens while it polishes. Aware that to elevate
            I must first soften, and that if I wished to purify I must first touch, I have
            ever endeavoured to bring forward grief, disappointment, the fallen leaf, the
            faded flower, the broken heart, and the early grave. Surely we must be less
            worldly, less interested, from this sympathy with the</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent">sorrow in which
            our unselfish feelings alone can take part. And now a few words on a subject,
            where the variety of the opinions offered have left me somewhat in the situation
            of the prince in the fairy tale, who, when in the vicinity of the magic
            fountain, found himself so distracted by the multitude of voices that directed
            his way, as to be quite incapable of deciding which was the right path. I allude
            to the blame and eulogy which have been equally bestowed on my frequent choice
            of Love as my source of song. I can only say, that for a woman, whose influence
            and whose sphere must be in the affections, what subject can be more fitting
            than one which it is her peculiar province to refine, spiritualise, and exalt? I
            have always sought to paint it self-</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">denying, devoted, and making an
            almost religion of its truth; and I must add, that such as I would wish to draw
            her, woman actuated by an attachment as intense as it is true, as pure as it is
            deep, is not only more admirable as a heroine, but also in actual life, than one
            whose idea of love is that of light amusement, or at worst of vain
            mortification. With regard to the frequent application of my works to myself,
            considering that I sometimes pourtrayed love unrequited, then betrayed, and
            again destroyed by death—may I hint the conclusions are not quite
            logically drawn, as assuredly the same mind cannot have suffered such varied
            modes of misery. However, if I must have an unhappy passion, I can only console
            myself with my own perfect unconsciousness of</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent">so great a
            misfortune. I now leave the following Poems to their fate: they must speak for
            themselves. I could but express my anxiety, an anxiety only increased by a
            popularity beyond my most sanguine dreams. 
         </p>
         <p>With regard to those whose former praise encouraged, their best recompense is the
            happiness they bestowed. And to those whose differing opinion expressed itself
            in censure, I own, after the first chagrin was past, I never laid down a
            criticism by which I did not benefit, or trust to benefit. I will conclude by
            apostrophizing the hopes and fears they excited, in the words of the Mexican
            king—"Ye have been the feathers of my wings."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span></p>
