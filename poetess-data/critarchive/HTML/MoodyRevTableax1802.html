            								of Charles Engleman. Translated from the German of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#LafontaineAugust">Augustus de la Fontaine</a></span>, by the Author of
            										Caroline of Litchfield (<a href="people.html#MontolieuIsabelle">Madame <span class="italics">de Crousaz</span></a>). <span class="">12</span>mo. 2 Vols. Paris. 1801. Imported by

         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">I</span><span class="smcaps">n</span> the preface to this work, Madame <span class="italics">Crousaz</span> gives an animated and ingenious description of that difficult
            					though humble province of literature,—translation; and she thus replies to
            					a friend, who compliments her on her peculiar excellence in this line:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p class="pnoindent">Yet I know nothing so ungrateful and thankless as the task of the translator.
               					If the version be good, it is the author alone to whom the reader feels himself
               					obliged; if the work be bad, the translator alone is accused: if the version
               be
               					liberal, it is said to want grace and elegance; if it be diffuse, it is
               					deficient in strength and spirit. The difficulty of exactly catching the genius
               					of one language which is not familiar to me, and which differs so materially
               					from my own, of preserving inviolate the strength of the one and the purity of
               					the other; and the obligation to alter nothing, to rigidly impart an idea in
               					which I do not accord, or to copy an incident which is displeasing, when
               					conscious that it might be improved: all these circumstances induce me to think
               					that it is easier to compose than to translate.
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p> Madame <span class="italics">de Crousaz</span> pursues this subject even to the
            					region of Parnassus; and she recounts to her friend the following <span class="italics">jeu d'esprit</span>, which was prefixed to one of
            					her former publications:

         <p>We have before observed<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span>, respecting
            					the writing of M. <span class="smcaps">De la Fontaine</span>, that one of his
            					qualities is to rise in the reader's estimation by gradual and progressive
            					advances; and this is surely preferable to the art of sinking, in which so many
            					are equal proficients. The first chapter of the volume before us is intitled,
            by
            					the journalist, 'My Commision of Biography,' and contains a whimsical
            					relation of the circumstances whence he derived the commission, with the manner
            					of his being invested with it. It is a painting of the Shandean school, and not
            					a bad copy of the mock solemnity of Sterne's affected pathos:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p class="pnoindent">This infant (added my father, pointing to me,) shall inherit this <span class="italics">Bible</span> after my death; and promise
               					me, my Charles, that you will fill all these blank leaves with the actions and
               					occurrences of your life, be they good or bad:— promise me, my
               					child,— My father rose from his seat, his eye was animated, his voice had
               					something of peculiar solemnity,—my uncle rose also, and laid down his
               					pipe,—my mother clasped her hands. This scene, and the solemn silence
               					which accompanied it, impressed my mind with awe; I advanced—I gave my
               					hand to my father—he took off his cap—my uncle held out his
               					hand—and my mother embraced me with tears in her eyes—while, to my
               					father's benediction, which accompanied the <span class="italics">Bible</span>, every one said—<span class="smcaps">Amen</span>.
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>From the hour of this <span class="italics">pathetic</span> ceremony, the young
            					Charles (then twelve years old) determined on being his own biographer; the
            					charms of authorship captivated his youthful imagination, and the first thing
            					which he wished to see was—a printing press. Instead of playing at
            					marbles, like other boys of his age, he was continually ruminating on the task
            					which his father had enjoined to be performed in the <span class="italics">Bible</span>; he prepared for it with the same speculation
            					which many authors exercise when they set out on travels, for the purpose of
            					making a book; and he availed himself of every little incident in his own
            					family. Apprehensive, however, that a journal barren of misfortunes would be
            					insipid, he earnestly wished that his life might be in some degree chequered
            					with sorrow, in order to afford just such a number of unhappy adventures, that
            a
            					spring of tears might not be wanting to water the dry ground of his
            					narrative.
         </p>
         <hr></hr>
         <p class="pageNumber">[Page 533]</p>
         <p> A love-story soon presents itself; and the journal improves (as Charles very
            					rightly conjectured it would) with the melancholy history of the beautiful
            					Susette; who is dismissed from her father's protection for a fault perhaps
            						<span class="italics">unpardonable</span>, but certainly not so <span class="italics">unnatural</span> as the conduct of her parent who, in
            					consequence of her frailty, abandons for ever his only child. We must not,
            					however, give too much attention (partial as we are to beauty) to this <span class="italics">picture</span>. <span class="italics">Le
               						Vaut-rien</span> is another equally interesting; the mournful incidents of his
            					life, it seems, were derived from his parents conceiving an aversion to him
            					because he was born with red hair; and <span class="italics">Le
               						Vaut-rien</span> (the good for nothing) owed this disgraceful name, with ten
            					thousand calamities, to the fatal influence of these ruddy locks.
         </p>
         <p> The character of the artful Julia is the best sketch of the painter; in which
            					the triumph of vice over virtue, and of virtue over vice, with the struggles
            					between ambition and love, are touches of an animated and ingenious pencil. In
            					the <span class="italics">picture</span> of the school, we are amused by the
            					master's whimsical method of classing his scholars according to the
            					impression which his ideas receive from their infantine physiognomy; and we
            					smile at the conceit of the aquiline noses being characteristics of
            					distinguished birth, seldom to be found among the vulgar.
         </p>
         <p> In taking leave of this journalist, we much acknowledge that we have been much
            					amused with many parts of his narrative: but we cannot close our remarks without
            					a hint of congratulation to our fair countrywomen, that they have not German
            					despots for parents. If the national character of the <span class="italics">German father</span> be accurately portrayed in the features of <span class="italics">Le grand Bailli</span>, and in those of <span class="italics">my Uncle</span> (who is a very bad copy of Uncle Toby),
            					our English wives and daughters may bless those kind stars which were the
            					ascendants at their birth, and commanded it to be on this side of the Northern
            					Ocean.
