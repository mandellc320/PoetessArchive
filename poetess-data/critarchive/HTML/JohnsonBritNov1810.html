            distaff; and the <a href="people.html#Hercules">Hercules</a> of
            literature, <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>, has not
            disdained to be the author of a novel. To say the truth, nothing which he has
            written has more the touch of genius than <span class="italics">Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia:</span> nor do any of his
            performances bear stronger marks of his peculiar character. It is solemn,
            melancholy and philosophical. The frame of the story is an elegant and happy
            exertion of fancy. It was probably suggested to his mind from recollections of
            the impression made upon his fancy by a book which he translated when he first
            entered on his literary career, namely, <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#LoboJeronimo">Father Lobo</a>'s Account
               of a Voyage to Abyssinia</span>.
         </p>
         <p>In that country, it is said, the younger branches of the royal family, instead of
            being sacrificed, as in some of the Eastern monarchies, to the jealousy of the
            reigning sovereign, are secluded from the world in a romantic and beautiful
            valley, where they are liberally provided with every thing that can gratify
            their tastes or amuse their solitude. This recess, which <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a> calls <span class="italics">the happy valley</span>, he has described with much
            richness of imagination. It is represented as being shut in by inaccessible
            mountains, and only to be entered through a cavern closed up with massy gates of
            iron, which were thrown </p>

            time artists and teachers of every kind, capable of contributing to the
            amusement or solace of the princes, were admitted; but once admitted, they were
            immured for life with the royal captives. Every charm of nature and every
            decoration of art is supposed to be collected in this charming spot, and that
            its inhabitants had been, in general, content with the round of amusements
            provided for them, till at length Rasselas, a young prince of a sprightly and
            active genius, grows weary of an existence so monotonous, and is seized with a
            strong desire of seeing the world at large. In pursuance of this project, he
            contrives to dig a passage through the mountain, and to escape from this
            paradise with his favourite sister Nekayah and her attendant, and the
            philosopher who had assisted them in their enterprise, and who, being previously
            acquainted with the world, is to assist their inexperience. They are all equally
            disgusted with the languor of sated desires and the inactivity of unvaried
            quiet, and agree to range the world in order to make their <span class="italics">choice of life</span>.
         </p>
         <p>The author, having thus stretched his canvass, proceeds to exhibit and to
            criticize the various situations and modes of human existence; public life and
            private; marriage and celibacy; commerce, rustic employments, religious
            retirement, &amp;c., and finds that in all there is something good and something
            bad—that marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures; that the
            hermit cannot secure himself from vice, but by retiring from the exercise of
            virtue; that </p>
            <hr></hr>

            Unable to decide amidst such various appearances of good and evil, and having
            seen enough of the world to be disgusted with it, they end their search by
            resolving to return with the first opportunity in order to end their days in the
            happy valley; and this, to use the author's words in the title of his last
            chapter, is "the conclusion, in which nothing is concluded."
         </p>
         <p>Such is the philosophic view which <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr.
               Johnson</a> and many others have taken of life; and such indecision would
            probably be the consequence of thus narrowly sifting the advantages and
            disadvantages of every station in this mixt state, if done without that feeling
            reference to each man's particular position, and particular inclinations,
            which is necessary to incline the balance. If we choose to imagine an insulated
            being, detached from all connexions and all duties, it may be difficult for mere
            reason to direct his choice; but no man is so insulated: we are woven into the
            web of society, and to each individual it is seldom dubious what <span class="italics">he</span> shall do. Very different is the search after
            abstract good, and the pursuit of what a being born and nurtured amidst
            innumerable ties of kindred and companionship, feeling his own wants, impelled
            by his own passions, and influenced by his own peculiar associations, finds best
            for <span class="italics">him</span>. Except he is indolent or fastidious, he
            will seldom hesitate upon his choice of life. The same position holds good with
            regard to duty. We may bewilder ourselves in abstract questions of general good,
            or puzzle our moral sense with imagi-</p>
            <table class="milestone">
               <tr>
                  <td>a2</td>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iv]</p><p class="pnoindent">nary cases of conscience; but it is
            generally obvious enough to every man what duty dictates to him, in each
            particular case, as it comes before him.
         </p>
         <p>The proper moral to be drawn from <span class="italics">Rasselas</span> is, therefore, not that goods and evils are so
            balanced against each other that no unmixed happiness is to be found in
            life,—a deduction equally trite and obvious; nor yet that a reasoning man
            can make no choice,—but rather that a <span class="italics">merely</span>
            reasoning man will be likely to make no choice,—and therefore that it
            becomes every man to make early that choice to which his particular position,
            his honest partialities, his individual propensities, his early associations
            impel him. Often does it happen that, while the over-refined and speculative are
            hesitating and doubting, the plain honest youth has secured happiness. Without
            this conclusion, the moral effect of the piece, loaded as it is with the
            miseries of life, and pointing out no path of action as more eligible than
            another, would resemble that of <span class="italics">Candide</span>, where the party, after all their adventures, agree to
            plant cabbages in their own garden: but the gloomy ideas of the English
            philosopher are softened and guarded by sound principles of religion.
         </p>
         <p>Along with <a href="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, he strongly paints
            and perhaps exaggerates the miseries of life; but instead of evading their force
            by laughing at them, or drawing from them a satire against Providence, which
            <span class="italics">Candide</span> may be truly said
            to be, our author turns the mind to the solid consolations of a future state:
            "All," says he, "that</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent"> virtue can afford is quietness
            of conscience, and a steady prospect of a future state: this may enable us to
            endure calamity with patience, but remember that patience must suppose
            pain."
         </p>
         <p>Such is the plan of this philosophical romance, in the progress of which the
            author makes many just strictures on human life, and many acute remarks on the
            springs of human passions; but they are the passions of the species, not of the
            individual. It is life, as viewed at a distance by a speculative man, in a kind
            of bird’s-eye view; not painted with the glow and colouring of an actor in the
            busy scene: we are not led to say, "This man is painted naturally,"
            but, "Such is the nature of man." The most striking of his pictures is
            that of the philosopher, who imagined himself to have the command of the
            weather, and who had fallen into that species of insanity by indulging in the
            luxury of solitary musing, or what is familiarly called castle-building. His
            state is strikingly and feelingly described, and no doubt with the peculiar
            interest arising from what the author had felt and feared in his own mind; for
            it is well known that at times he suffered under a morbid melancholy near akin
            to derangement, which occasionally clouded his mighty powers; and no doubt he
            had often indulged in these unprofitable abstractions of thought, these seducing
            excursions of fancy.
         </p>
         <p>The following remark ought to startle those who have permitted their mind to feed
            itself in solitude with its own creations and wishes. "All power of fancy
            over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> control or repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as
            any depravation of the mental faculties. In time, some particular train of ideas
            fixes the attention, all other intellectual gratifications are rejected. By
            degrees the reign of fancy is confirmed; she grows first imperious, and in time
            despotic; then fictions begin to operate as realities, false opinions fasten
            upon the mind, and life passes away in dreams of rapture or of
            anguish."
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Rasselas</span> is, perhaps, of all its
            author's works, that in which his peculiar style best harmonizes with the
            subject. That pompous flow of diction, that measured harmony of periods, that
            cadenced prose which <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>
            introduced, though it would appear stiff and cumbrous in the frame of a common
            novel, is sanctioned by the imitation, or what our authors have agreed to call
            imitation, of the Eastern style, a style which has been commonly adopted in
            <span class="italics">Almoran and Hamet</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span><span class="italics">Tales of the Genii</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span>
            and other works, in which the costume is taken from nations whose remoteness
            destroys the idea of colloquial familiarity. We silence our reason by the laws
            we have imposed upon our fancy, and are content that both Nekayah and her female
            attendant, at the sources of the Nile, or the foot of the
            Pyramid, should express themselves in language which would appear unnaturally
            inflated in the mouths of a young lady and her waiting-maid conversing together
            in London or in Paris. It has been
            remarked, however, that Nekayah, it is difficult to say why, is more
            philosophical than her brother.
         </p>
         <p>It has been already mentioned that the frame</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> of this piece was
            probably suggested by the author’s having some years before translated an
            account of Abyssinia. It may be remarked by the way, how
            different an idea of the country and its inhabitants seems to have been
            entertained at that time from that which is suggested by the accounts of <a href="people.html#BruceJames">Bruce</a> and <a href="people.html#AnnesleyGeorge">Lord Valentia</a>. <a href="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</a>, who probably took his ideas
            from the voyage-writers of the time, represents the country of "jealous
            Abyssinia" as a perfect paradise, "a world
            within itself; disdaining all assault;" and mentions the "palaces, and
            fanes, and villas, and gardens, and cultured fields" of this innocent and
            amiable people with poetic rapture. We must suppose that <a href="people.html#LoboJeronimo">Father Lobo</a> never had the honour of
            dancing with them on a gala-day.
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Rasselas</span> was published in 1759, and was then
            composed for the purpose of enabling the author to visit his mother in her last
            illness, and for defraying the expenses of her funeral. It was written with
            great rapidity; for the author himself has told us that it was composed in the
            evenings of one week, sent to the press in portions as it was written, and never
            reperused when finished. It was much read, and has been translated into several
            languages. Rich indeed must be the stores of that mind which could pour out its
            treasures with such rapidity, and clothe its thoughts, almost spontaneously, in
            language so correct and ornamented.
         </p>
         <p>Perhaps the genius of <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>
            has been in some measure mistaken. The ponderosity of his manner has led the
            world to give him more credit for science, and less for fancy, than</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> the character of his works will justify. His remarks on life and manners are
            just and weighty, and show a philosophical mind, but not an original turn of
            thinking. The novelty is in the style; but originality of style belongs to that
            dress and colouring of our thoughts in which imagination is chiefly
            concerned.
         </p>
         <p>In fact, imagination had great influence over him. His ideas of religion were
            awful and grand, and he had those feelings of devotion which seldom subsist in a
            strong degree in a cold and phlegmatic mind; but his religion was tinctured with
            superstition, his philosophy was clouded with partialities and prejudices, his
            mind was inclined to melancholy.
         </p>
         <p>In the work before us he has given testimony to his belief in apparitions, and
            has shown a leaning towards monastic institutions. Of his discoveries in any
            region of science posterity will be able to speak but little; but in his
            <span class="italics">Ramblers</span> he will be
            considered as having formed a new style, and his <span class="italics">Rasselas</span>, and <span class="italics">Vision of
               Theodore</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> must give him an honourable place among those writers who deck
            philosophy with the ornamented diction and the flowers of fancy.
         </p>
         <p>It should not be forgotten to be noticed in praise of <span class="italics">Rasselas</span>, that it is, as well as all
            the other works of its author, perfectly pure. In describing the happy valley,
            he has not, as many authors would have done, painted a luxurious bower of bliss,
            nor once throughout the work awakened any ideas which might be at variance with
            the moral truths which all his writings are meant to inculcate.
