         <p class=""><span class="largest">T</span>HE first publication which
            appears in this selection has so little the air of a common novel, that many
            will probably be surprised to see it included under that denomination; and some,
            who consider their old friend <span class="italics">Robinson
               Crusoe</span> as a mere school-boy acquaintance, may wonder to see
            him in such good company as the <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charleses</a> and the <a href="people.html#WilliamsBetty">Lady
               Betties</a> of fashionable life. But the truth is, this favourite of our
            early years, though it has no pretensions to the graces of style, nor aims at
            touching the tender passions, yields to few in the truth of its description and
            its power of interesting the mind. Its author, <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">D<span class="smcaps">aniel de </span>F<span class="smcaps">oe</span></a>, is a name well known in the political
            history of his age. He was born in London in 1663; his father was a butcher; his
            education was a common one, and none of his works bear any marks of that polish
            and elegance of style which is the mingled result of a classical education, and
            of associating with the more cultivated orders of society: but he was a man of a
            truly original genius, and possessed in a remarkable degree the power of giving
            such an air of truth and nature to his narrations that </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ii]</p><p class="pnoindent">they are rather
            deceptions than imitations. In that particular cast of his genius he resembled
            <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, his antipodes in
            politics and religion. The talent of grave irony, and the attention to those
            minute circumstances, those apparently undersigned touches, which cause the
            reader to exclaim, "No man could surely have thought of this if it had not
            been true," were alike in both. To the <span class="italics">humour</span>
            of <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> had no pretensions. This
            author was educated a dissenter, and was greatly attached to the cause of
            liberty and protestantism: he was early in life engaged in the unfortunate
            rebellion of the <a href="people.html#MonmouthJamesScott">duke of
               Monmouth</a>, but had the good fortune to escape the severe vengeance
            which was exercised after his defeat, and to return unmolested to London, where
            he followed his business of a maker of bricks and pantiles. He was not however
            successful, and became insolvent; but he honourably paid his creditors as soon
            as his circumstances enabled him so to do. From this period he attracted great
            notice as a writer by a number of publications, chiefly political, which came
            from his pen. One of them, entitled <span class="italics">The shortest
               Way with the Dissenters</span>, drew upon him a severe punishment.
            It was written in 1702, when the high-church party were inclined to persecute
            the sectaries. The grave ironical style in which it was written, at first
            deceived the public, and many thought him in earnest. The same thing is said to
            have happened to <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>, on the
            publication of his <span class="italics">Proposal for fattening and
               eating the Children of the poor Irish</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> The house of

            be burnt by the hangman; and a prosecution was begun against the publishers.
            <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> had secreted himself, but
            honourably came forward to screen the publishers, and was sentenced to the
            severe and degrading punishment of the pillory, besides fine and imprisonment.
            The composure with which he bore his punishment gave occasion to the following
            sarcasm from <a href="people.html#PopeAlexander">Pope</a>, who hated both
            whigs and dissenters, </p>

         <p> While he was still in prison he commenced a periodical publication entitled
            <span class="italics">The Review</span>. It was
            published twice or thrice a week, and besides news, domestic and political,
            contained the fiction of a club discussing various topics of a miscellaneous
            nature, which in all probability gave the hint to <a href="people.html#SteeleRichard">Steele</a> and <a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a> for the frame they used
            afterwards with so much success in the papers of <span class="italics">The Tatler</span> and <span class="italics">Spectator</span>. <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De
               Foe</a> was liberated by the interposition of <a href="people.html#OxfordRobertHarley">Harley</a>, and afterwards
            employed by the <a href="people.html#AnneQueenofGreatBritain">queen</a> in
            Scotland, when the union was projected. He had great knowledge of affairs of
            commerce and revenue, on which subjects he was often consulted. After the union
            had taken place, he wrote the history of it in a folio volume. It seems strange
            that one so much employed as he was at that time should obtain no settled
            provision; and still more, that upon the accession of <a href="people.html#GeorgeIIKingofGreatBritain">George the Second</a>,
            when the whigs were again in power, he was not rewarded for his sufferings in

            it is to be feared his integrity was not quite equal to his abilities, and he
            had given offence by some publications which were at least ambiguous, and laid
            him open to the censure of writing on both sides. He seems therefore from this
            time to have given up politics, and to have employed his pen in composing those
            works by which his name has been best known to posterity. Among these were his
            <span class="italics">Family Instructor</span> and
            <span class="italics">Religious Courtship</span>. They
            both consist of dialogues on religious and moral subjects, relative to the
            conduct of life in its various situations and occurrencess. They have not the
            least pretensions to elegance, and an air of religious austerity pervades the
            whole of them; but their dramatic form of dialogues, supported with much nature
            and feeling, and the interest which his manner of writing has thrown into the
            familiar stories and incidents of domestic and common life, has made these
            publications, especially the former, exceedingly popular to this day among those
            whose religious opinions are similar to his own. <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> also wrote <span class="italics">A Journal of the Plague Year</span>. It is
            written in the person of a citizen, a shopkeeper, who is supposed to have staid
            in the metropolis during the whole time of the calamity; and the particulars are
            so striking, so awful, and so circumstantial, that it deceived most of his
            readers, and amongst others it is said Dr. Mead, into a belief of its
            authenticity;—an exercise of ingenuity not to be commended;—though,
            after all, the particulars were probably most of them true, though the relater
            was fictitious. <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> also wrote
            many </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">pieces in verse, which, though they had no pretensions to poetry
            properly so called, had many passages that were nervous and pointed. One,
            entitled <span class="italics">Reformation of Manners</span>,
            contains a strong invective against the slave-trade. A satire called <span class="italics">The true-born Englishman</span> was much read
            in its time, though it gave great offence. Its purport was to parry the attacks
            made against <a href="people.html#WilliamIIIKingofEngland">king
               William</a> as a foreigner, by showing that the English themselves were a
            very mixed breed, who had no purity of blood to boast of.—But the work by
            which this writer is best known, both at home and abroad, is that which is
            presented to the public in this selection, <span class="italics">The
               Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.</span></p>
         <p> It has been translated into most modern languages, has passed through numberless
            editions, and has always been found particularly agreeable to the taste of
            youth. The story turns upon the ingenuity and contrivance with which a solitary
            being, wrecked upon a desert island, provides for his subsistence, and by
            degrees supplies himself with all the most desirable accommodations of life. The
            reader is wonderfully delighted to see him acquire one comfort after another,
            and grows at length almost in love with his solitude. Some have thought the
            author has shortened his labour too much by allowing him so many articles out of
            the ship; but without them the story, though it might have displayed more
            mechanical invention, would have gone on rather heavily. Besides the ingenuity
            of contrivance displayed in this work, there are many circumstances which
            strongly </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> affect the feelings. The terror inspired by the impression
            of the <span class="italics">foot in the sand</span>; the luminous eyes,
            glaring like two lamps, at the bottom of the cave; and the affectionate
            simplicity of poor Friday, agitate the mind in various ways. The latter has a
            great deal of simple and natural pathos; and nothing in description can be more
            lively than the account of his meeting with his old father, who is saved from
            the cannibals, and of the fond and animated expressions of his affection to him
            both then, and when he meets him again on the island. 
         </p>
         <p> A strong tincture of religious feeling runs through the work, not unmixed with
            superstition. Dreams, omens, and impressions on the mind occur, in which <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> was either a believer, or at
            least he knew how to take advantage of them in impressing his readers. That he
            was not very scrupulous in this point, appears from the following
            anecdote:—<span class="italics">Drelincourt on Death</span>, a grave
            religious book, not going off so well as the booksellers wished, they applied,
            it is said, to <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> to write
            something which might give it a lift; for which purpose he composed <span class="italics">The Apparition of Mrs. Veal</span>. Though
            pure invention, it was told in so natural and circumstantial a way, that it
            gained credit with hundreds of readers; and being prefixed to the work, the
            impression sold rapidly.—It is said that <span class="italics">Robinson Crusoe</span> has given many a boy a predilection for a
            seafaring life; which is not unlikely; for the variety of adventures it contains
            kindles curiosity, and even when the subject of them is in his most forlorn and
            solitary state, there is something gratifying </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> to the imagination
            in contemplating him as king and owner of every thing about him; </p>
            <blockquote>
               <table>
                  <tr>
                     <td><span class="l">I am monarch of all I survey,</span></td>

                  </tr>
               </table>
            </blockquote><p class="pnoindent"> Among the striking passages of the work may be mentioned the encounter
            with the wolves and bears in crossing the Pyrenees. The second part, like most
            second parts, is much inferior to the first. We lose our old acquaintance the
            Solitary, and are presented with a Missionary in his stead. The story is
            confused with a variety of adventures, in which however the author exhibits his
            knowledge of the course of trade, which he was well acquainted with, and manners
            and customs which he had heard or read of, in China, Tartary, Siberia, and other
            countries. The most striking passage in this volume is the lively description of
            the sufferings of a young woman dying in the agonies of hunger. <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> has shown a candour, at that
            time not very common, in giving a very amiable character of a French catholic
            priest; but the adventure of burning the Tartar idol, if it is meant as a heroic
            exploit, shows very confused ideas of justice.—It must not be concealed
            that the originality of this work has been disputed to <a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a> from the following
            circumstance. One <a href="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Alexander
               Selkirk</a> really passed some years alone on the island of Juan
            Fernandez, and a sketch of his story had been given in the relation of <a href="people.html#RogersWoodes">Woodes Rogers</a>. This might very
            probably give the first hint of his romance; but as to the report that </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> he possessed papers of <a href="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Selkirk</a>'s and had made unacknowledged use of them, it appears to
            have been propagated without any solid ground whatever; and indeed the situation
            in which Robinson Crusoe is placed, and from which most of the incidents arise,
            materially differs from that of <a href="people.html#SelkirkAlexander">Selkirk</a>.—<a href="people.html#DefoeDaniel">De Foe</a>
            wrote many other lives and adventures, and employed his ready pen to the end of
            his laborious life, which took place in London, in April 1731, in his 68th year.
