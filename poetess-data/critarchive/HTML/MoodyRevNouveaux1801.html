         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">R</span><span class="smcaps">ecollecting</span> the pleasure which we formerly received from the inventive
            					genius and sprightly talents of the deceased author of these volumes, we took
            					them up with an avidity and a confidence which precluded all idea of
            					disappointment. If, said we to ourselves, these tales be genuine, (of which,
            we
            					are told in the preface, the widow of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span> has given the public
            					an assurance,) we shall be much entertained: for, though the vigor of his mind
            					may be in some degree abated, and the brilliancy of his setting may not
            					altogether equal that of his meridian sun, yet <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span> must be <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span>; and this new collection of Moral Tales must, by their
            					prominent features, evince their affinity to those of which we gave an account
            					in an early volume of our Review. (See M.R. vol. xxx. p. 59.) This consanguinity
            					is proved indeed by indisputable marks; and, being the production of his graver
            					years, these tales are more moral than those which were before published. If,
            					also, they have lost some of the exuberance which distinguished the former, our
            					opinion of them will shew that the merit of these is not lessened on that
            					account.—The editor says that they will be found to possess equal merit
            					with those tales which have given celebrity to the name of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span>; —that they display, in captivating language,
            					invention, interest, ease, and elegance; that the moral which they inculcate
            is
            					always amiable and pure; and in short that it has been the principal object of
            					the author, to form the mind and taste of the rising generation, and to develop
            					those germs of virtuous sentiments which nature has implanted in the human
            					heart.—A publication of such a tendency, we can have no reluctance in
            					recommending to the British public.
         </p>
         <p>The introductory tale is intitled <span class="italics">the Evening
               						Meeting;</span> and it describes a society of intimate friends, who, during
            					the commotions of Paris, assembled at the country-house of a Madame <span class="italics">de Verval</span>. As this lady was a great lover of
            					stories, and possessed the talent of reciting them in the most natural and
            					agreeable manner, she proposed that, for amusement, each of the party should
            in
            					turn form and recount a tale, including the most interesting events of their
            					life, without invading the sacred recesses of confidence. This proposition being
            					accepted by the whole party, each narrates a personal memoir; and the general
            					conclusion from the whole is that the parts of </p>
            <table class="milestone">
               <tr>
                  <td>11</td>
               </tr>
            </table><p class="pnoindent"></p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 543]</p><p class="pnoindent">our lives, which have contributed
            					most to our happiness, are those which have originated in virtuous sentiments,
            					or have been occupied in acts of benevolence.
         </p>
         <p> The second tale is called <span class="italics">the Tripod of <a href="people.html#Helen">Helen</a>;</span> and its object seems to be
            					to ridiculue the pride of philosophy, and to shew the limits of science. <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span> might have taken these lines of Pope for his motto: </p>
            <blockquote>
               <table>
                  <tr>
                     <td><span class="l">In parts superior what advantage lies?</span></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td><span class="l">Say, for thou canst, what is it to be wise?</span></td>

                  </tr>
               </table>
            </blockquote><p class="pnoindent"> This doctrine is illustrated with great vivacity of imagination, and
            					excellent satire; and here we recognize the hand of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a></span> himself. The scene
            					is laid in remote antiquity. He supposes that <a href="people.html#Helen">Helen</a> and Menelaus, being reconciled after the destruction of Troy,
            					were returning to Lacedæmon, when they were assailed by a violent tempest
            					as they were passing through the Cyclades, and were in imminent danger of being
            					wrecked on the island of Cos. At this instant, <a href="people.html#Helen">Helen</a> invoked the inconstant God of the ocean to protect a female
            					whose disposition was so similar to his own; and, in order to give effect to
            her
            					prayer, she presented him with a Golden Tripod, which had been saved from the
            					pillage of Troy. On throwing this offering into the sea, the storm subsided,
            and
            					the danger disappeared.—During six hundred years, this tripod lay at the
            					bottom of the ocean: but at last it was again brought to light by some
            					fishermen. After some contention about the property, between the neighbouring
            					islands, it was wisely agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the Delphic
            					Oracle; who settled the dispute by ordering the tripod to be presented to <span class="italics">the Wisest of the Wise</span>. Where however, were they
            					to find this distinguished personage? They were puzzled to ascertain to which
            of
            					the seven wise men, who flourished in Greece at that period, this title
            					belonged: but, apprehending that this was a question which the philosophers
            					themselves could easily determine, they appoint deputies to wait on them
            					respectively; who commence with an application to <span class="italics">Thales</span>, the Milesian, their neighbour.
         </p>
         <p>This philosopher, however, fairly confesses that all his knowledge has only
            					served to convince him <span class="italics">how little he knows</span>; and
            					that he continues his researches only with the view of encouraging his
            					disciples, and in the hope that time, in his wonder-working progress, may lift
            					up some corner of the immense veil of nature. He therefore advises them to offer
            					the tripod to <span class="italics">Solon</span>, who pursues the straight path
            					to usefulness in the study of man, and whose object is to render him better and
            					happier.—In consequence, the deputies next apply to the Athenian
            					legislator, but with no better success. <span class="italics">Solon</span>
            					re-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 544]</p><p class="pnoindent">fers them to <span class="italics">Bias, Bias</span> to <span class="italics">Chilo</span> the Spartan, &amp;c. and thus the tripod is
            					bandied about from sage to sage; each of whom, acknowledging his own
            					insufficiency and weakness, rejects the epithet of <span class="italics">the
               						Wisest of the Wise</span>. In this conduct, perhaps, they are represented as
            					much wiser than they really were; for here it appears that they <span class="italics">knew themselves</span>, which is one of the most
            					difficult attainments. The seven wise men of Greece, each rejecting for himself
            					the high compliment of <span class="italics">the Wisest of the Wise</span>,
            					agree to give their several definitions of wisdom; and to award the tripod to
            					him who should unite its characters in the highest degree. One defines it to
            					consist in an <span class="italics">unalterable tranquillity of mind, under
               						all the diversities of fortune;</span> another, in <span class="italics">a
               						profound self knowledge, applied in rendering ourselves good and happy;</span>
            					a third, <span class="italics">in the moderation of our desires;</span> the
            					fourth, in the <span class="italics">power of regulating the present, and
               						preparing for the future, by the experience of the past;</span> another, <span class="italics">in a strength of mind which is capable of resisting the
               						passions;</span> and the sixth, <span class="italics">in the absolute
               						empire of reason over the will</span>.— Scarcely are these definitions
            					of wisdom given, when <span class="italics">Bias</span> concludes by deciding
            					that these attributes can never unite in any individual mortal, and that they
            					can belong only to a God. Hence, it is decreed that the Golden Tripod should
            be
            					carried to the temple at Delphos, and there consecrated to <a href="people.html#Apollo">Apollo</a>.

         <p>Having but lately received these volumes, and having now approached to the close
            					of our present Appendix, we cannot enter into an analysis of the other tales
            					which they contain: but we shall subjoin the titles of them, in order to give
            					our readers some idea of their nature and subjects. III. <span class="italics">The Lesson of Misfortune</span>. IV. <span class="italics">The School of Friendship:</span> in which we have a tutor
            					resembling <a href="people.html#SirCharlesGrandison">Sir Charles
               						Grandison</a>, and a pupil not unlike <a href="people.html#EmilyJervois">Emily Jervis</a>, innocently in love
            					with him. V. <span class="italics">The Generous Breton</span>. VI. <span class="italics">The Error of a good Father</span>. This tale was related
            					by <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Cideville">Cideville</a></span> to <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</a></span> when he was
            					ill:—the descriptions in it are beautifully pathetic. VII. <span class="italics">The Casket</span>. VIII. <span class="italics">The
               						Self-Rivals</span>. IX. <span class="italics">The Villages Breakfasts</span>.
            					X. <span class="italics">The Watermen of Besons</span>. XI. <span class="italics">It must be so</span>. <span class="smcaps">XII</span>.
            						<span class="italics">The Hermits of Murica</span>. XIII. <span class="italics">Palemon</span>, an Arcadian Pastoral, from two pictures
            					by <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#Poussin">Poussin</a></span>. XIV. <span class="italics">Fire-side-recollection</span>.
            					XV. <span class="italics">The Mountain of the two Lovers.</span></p>
         <p>Some of these tales were printed in the <span class="italics">Mercure</span><span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> in the years 1789, 90, 91, and 92. They abound
            					with genuine satire and wit, with pathetic sentiment and sound sense. 
         </p>
         <p>Prefixed to the 1st vol. is a portrait of the author; under which is a memorandum
            					that <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Marmontel">Jean-Francois
                  							Marmontel</a></span> was born on the 11th of July 1723, and died at
            					Abbeville, Dec 29, 1799.
