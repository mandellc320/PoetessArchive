         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">O</span><span class="smcaps">f</span> the various species of composition that in course come before us,
            					there are none in which <span class="italics">our</span> writers of the male
            					sex have less excelled, since the days of Richardson and Fielding, than in the
            					arrangement of a novel. Ladies seem to appropriate to themselves an exclusive
            					privilege in this kind of writing; witness the numerous productions of romantic
            					tales to which female authors have given birth. The portraiture of the tender
            					passions, the delicacy of sentiment, and the easy flow of style, may, perhaps,
            					be most adapted to the genius of the softer sex: but however that may be,
            					politeness, certainly, will not suffer us to dispute this palm with our fair
            					competitors. We, though of the harder sex, as men, and of a still harder <span class="italics">race as critics</span>, are no enemies to an affecting
            					well-told story: but as we are <span class="italics">known</span> not to be
            					very <span class="italics">easily pleased</span>, it may be imagined that those
            					performances only will obtain the sanction of our applause, which can stand the
            					test of certain criteria of excellence.
         </p>
         <p> The story of a novel should be formed of a variety of interesting incidents; a
            					knowlege of the world, and of mankind, are essential requisites in the writer;
            					the characters should be always natural; the personages should talk, think, and
            					act, as becomes their respective ages, situations, and characters; the
            					sentiments should be moral, chaste, and delicate; the language should be easy,
            					correct, and elegant, free from affectation, and unobscured by pedantry; and
            the
            					narrative should be as little interrupted as possible by digressions and
            					episodes of every kind: yet if an author chuses to indulge, occasionally, in
            					moral reflections, in the view of blending instruction with amusement, we would
            					not wish, altogether, to frustrate so good a design:—but, that his
            					precepts may obtain the utmost efficacy, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 401]</p><p class="pnoindent">we would recommend them to
            					be inserted in those periods of the history, where the reader's curiosity
            					can most patiently submit to suspense. 
         </p>
         <p> Having thus given a sketch of what a novel should be to <span class="italics">please us</span>, we proceed to the work which has given occasion to these
            					remarks.
         </p>
         <p> This novel, then, consists of a series of letters between the Hon. Mr. Wilton
            					and his friend Mr. Benfield. Mr. Wilton is the son of Lord Wilton, a cruel,
            					avaritious, despotic parent, who wishes to force his son into a marriage,
            					(extremely against his inclinations,) with Miss Silvertop, a young lady of large
            					fortune: the parties are introduced to each other, and are left alone for the
            					purpose of <span class="italics">making love</span>; when, unluckily, the
            					gentleman begins by asking the young lady, <span class="italics">which are
               						her favourites among the dramatic authors</span>. Miss Silvertop, not having
            					been instructed in her literary catechism, stares, and seems not to comprehend
            					him. He is not, however, discouraged: but pursues his <span class="italics">learned inquiries</span>, till at last the young lady betrays such a total
            						<span class="italics">want of erudition</span>, that Mr. Wilton, completely
            					disgusted, resolves, in defiance of all paternal injunctions, to decline the
            					marriage. Lord Wilton is in great wrath, utters dreadful imprecations, and even
            					curses his son, who runs out of the house, gets into a stage coach, and arrives
            					at Morpeth in Northumberland; where he becomes enamoured of a beautiful young
            					lady, named Olivia. Mr. Fennel, one of Olivia's lovers, is jealous of Mr.
            					Wilton, and sends him a challenge; a duel ensues—Mr. W. disarms and wounds
            					his antagonist; who is so enraged, that he <span class="italics">insists on
               						being dead</span>, that Mr. W. may be <span class="italics">hanged:</span>—the latter is therefore, with all due formality, ushered
            					into a prison: but Mr. Fennel, having reported <span class="italics">falsely
               						of himself that he was </span><span class="smcaps">dead</span>, and being <span class="italics">taken alive</span>, Mr. Wilton is released from his
            					confinement, and marries Olivia; who proves to be another Miss Silvertop. The
            					old Lord, who had determined an alliance with the family of the Silvertops,
            					recalls his curses, and changes them into blessings; and a happy union likewise
            					takes place, with regard to an episodical pair, whose adventures serve to
            					diversify the work:—which here naturally concludes.
         </p>
         <p> In regard to the general character of Mr. Thomson's performance, it
            					certainly is not void of merit. The volumes abound with pious and moral
            					reflections, not unworthy the pen of a clergyman: but we should have admired
            					this piety and this morality still more, had the language (especially of the
            					earlier letters,) been less verbose, and the style less stiffened with hard
            					words. Terms of the same signification are frequently </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 402]</p><p class="pnoindent">coupled
            						together<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span>: a mode of writing rather suitable to an indenture than a book
            					of entertainment; and peculiarly inconsistent with the natural case and freedom
            					of the epistolary style.
         </p>
         <p> Notwithstanding the impropriety of the language of some parts of this work, for
            					it is not uniformly thus censurable, the story has not failed to interest us
            in
            					the perusal; and it would be great injustice to the sensible writer, if we did
            					not speak of his performance as entitled to a considerable degree of distinction
            					above the common crowed—the <span class="italics">canaille</span> of
            					modern romances and novels.
         </p>
         <p> The leading moral purpose of this work, is to expose the unreasonableness,
            					absurdity, and tyranny, of parents who usurp an absolute authority over their
            					children, in respect of their matrimonial engagements; forcing all natural
            					affection, and every prospect of happiness from that source, to give way to the
            					calls of avarice or ambition.—This is a beaten path, which has been
            					trodden by almost every novellist and dramatic writier;—who, we are happy
            					to think, have successively encountered a monster which is now seldom seen but
            					in their performances.

            							timidity;' p. 32.—Other expressions, which we have remarked,
            							seem much too stiff and pedantic for the characters that use
            							them,—as, 'Pray, Madam,' answers Mr. Wilton to a
            							question from his lady mother, ' what prompts the interrogation
            							?'—' My dear Henry,' says the countess, 'I am
            							afraid the air of your native country, after so long an absence in the
            							warmer climates of France and Italy, is not <span class="italics">congenial</span> to your health, as you seem to have <span class="italics">acquired</span> a slight indisposition this
            							morning,' p. 33.; and the Hon. Mr. W. is, in like manner, accosted
            							by his honourable sister, with 'Pray, Henry, if our native air be
            							more <span class="italics">salubrious</span> than that of the

            							nobleman answer his Right Hon. father's haughty commands to marry
            							the lady <span class="italics">not</span> of his choice: 'The will

            								observe, also, that the hero of this piece is said to be the only
