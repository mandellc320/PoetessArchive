         <p><span class="large">I</span><span class="smcaps">t</span> must be a very universal maxim to suit all circumstances, and yet there is one
            					which may be applied on all occasions—"Judge not" is the general
            					motto. Take the actions of our nearest friends, and how little do we know of
            the
            					hopes that instigated, or of the fears that prevailed! We sometimes cannot avoid
            					owning that we ourselves have committed a fault, but how we gloss it
            					over—how we take temperament and temptation into account, till at length
            					it appears to be a thing inevitable—redeemed by the regret it has
            					occasioned, and the lesson it has given. Not so do we reason for
            					others—then we look to the isolated fact, not to the causes: the error
            					shuts out the excuse. The truth is, we know nothing of each other excepting by
            					the aid of philosophy and of poetry; philosophy, that analyzes our thoughts,
            and
            					poetry that expresses our feelings. Little of the examination of the one, or
            of
            					the tenderness of the other, enters into our daily opinions, and yet by them
            we
            					alone know the hidden heart within. "Judge not" is the first great
            					rule of the moral world; it is equally applicable to the literary one. Yesterday
            					is constantly reversing the decree of to-day; our notion of our contemporaries
            					is biassed in many ways—vanities, envyings, and prejudices are things
            							</p>

            					leveller, but he is also the sanctifier and the beautifier. If our judgement,
            					then, of our own literature be liable to so many objections, what must it be
            					when we attempt to decide on that of a foreign nation; the maxim, "Judge
            					not," must indeed be the first principle laid down. No stranger can enter
            					into one great charm thrown around the poetry of every country—namely,
            					that of association. Unconsciously to ourselves, we connect with our favourite
            					writers the emotions which first made us seek in them for expression, and with
            					the scenes amid which we turned their pages. Did we read them in summer, under
            					the silver shiver of the aspen?—they have gathered to themselves the
            					sunshine raining through the leaves, and the freshness on the open air. Were
            					they our companions by the hearth-side on a long winter evening?—they are
            					linked with pleasant memories of comfort and of home. It is impossible for a
            					stranger to share these subtle sympathies, and yet their atmosphere is around
            					the literature of every nation. But literary, like all other commerce, has its
            					incalculable advantages: the merchant brings with him not only wealth, but
            					knowledge. Communication is in itself civilization; we wear away our own
            					prejudices only by contact with those of others. We are forced into making
            					allowances, by seeing how much we need that they should be made for ourselves.

         <p><a href="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a> says, in an
            					admirable spirit of candour, "In living literature no person is a competent
            					judge but of works written in his own language. I have expressed my opinion
            					concerning a number of English writers; it is very possible that I may be
            					mistaken, that my admiration and my censure may be equally misplaced, and that
            					my conclusions may appear impertinent and ridiculous on the other side of the
            						Channel."<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> They can appear neither ridiculous nor impertinent;
            						we</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 63]</p><p class="pnoindent"> may, and we do differ from many of these conclusions, but we
            					feel that they have been drawn by a clever man, and drawn, too, in a spirit of
            					candour. If any man be entitled to form a judgment, that man is <a href="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a>. A poet himself, his
            					whole life has been a poet's education, and he has studied our literature
            					next to his own. But there is something in the French and the English character
            					so essentially opposed, that it is impossible for them to understand each other.
            					Now a nation's character is in its literature. Some writer says, "The
            					great difference of the two nations is, that the one lives out of doors and the
            					other in; the one thinks of the people that are looking at him, and the other
            					thinks of himself."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> This principle will account for the frequent
            					self-reference in these pages, which, however, has more the appearance than the
            					reality of vanity. An Englishman is timid of drawing attention to
            					himself—he is afraid of being laughed at; a Frenchman, on the contrary,
            					relies on your indulgence. <a href="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a> believes that genius is a moral problem, which it is
            					matter of general attraction to solve; and he submits rather than advances his
            					pretensions to the public, with a quiet conviction of their interest, which an
            					English writer, however successful, would be too well aware of his and our
            					national characteristics, to adventure. The style of the author of
            						"Atala"<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> has no parallel in our literature—it is what
            					supplies in France the place of blank verse; it is redundant in epithet and
            					simile, many of which appear to us grandiloquent: for example, <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</a> is called "the
            					young butcher of Strafford."<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> Again, speaking of our writers among the
            					lower classes, he says, "At the present day it is a blacksmith that
            					shines—Vulcan was the son of Jupiter:"<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> the illustration is rather magnificent.
            					By-the-by, to what blacksmith does he allude?—we must confess our
            					ignorance. There is a curious little instance of the mistakes inevitable to
            					foreign critics: <a href="people.html#Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a>
            					quotes, as a charming specimen of our simple ballad poetry, a stanza of a song:—</p>

            					golden chalices and fragrant incense of Catholicism. He forms, in his
            					mind's eye, the picture of a monk after one <a href="people.html#ReniGuido">Guido</a>'s head, "pale,

            					to admit that we do not do justice to the beneficial influence exercised by the
            					Catholic church on the darker ages. It was the republic of the time, supported
            					by democratic talent. The man of ability found in the church his theatre of
            					action; all other avenues to power or to distinction were barred by the sword,
            					which was given as a birthright to the noble. But in the ranks of the Catholic
            					faith the equality, or rather the superiority of intellect was asserted; and
            					when king and chief knelt at the chair of St. Peter, it was the triumph of
            					thought over strength—it was the weak mind subjugated by the strong. But,
            					as usual, the authority outlived its necessity—other influences began
            					their activity; and again, as usual, one of those men arose who embody their
            					epoch, and carry its spirit into action. That man was <a href="people.html#LutherMartin">Luther</a>. He was an
            					enthusiast—enthusiasm is needed for action; calculation never
            					acts—it is a passive principle. He was fierce, angry, and governed by
            					impulse; but we must remember the old Greek proverb, "Motives are from man,
            					but impulse is from Heaven." These qualities only the better fitted the

            					believed no more in love than he believed in anything else. A woman was to him
