         <p>I<span class="smcaps">n</span> the slight sketches which will from time to time
            					occupy a page of the <span class="italics">
               					Athenæum</span>, we shall alternate between the dead and the living,
            					the past time and the present, and thus tincture criticism with biography. Would
            					that the interesting and gifted woman whose name is prefixed to this paper,
            					could be numbered among the living! Would that, instead of closing her works
            					with the saddened feeling, that the source whence so much pure amusement
            					emanated is sealed for ever, we could glance over the list of books "nearly
            					ready for publication," and find another announced by the same author. <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>, however, has been dead
            					fourteen years; and from what has been laid before the public of a biographical
            					nature, (slight as that is,) there seldom appears to have been a more beautiful
            					accordance between an author's life and writings; in fact, in the life and
            					education of <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>, may be
            					discerned many of the causes of the excellencies that mark her works. Her father
            					was a clergyman, a scholar, a man of fine general taste, and for forty years
            he
            					resided on his living, (Steventon, in Hants,) conscientiously discharging its
            					ministerial duties in his own person. <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss
               						Austen</a> was thus placed from infancy under two influences, calculated
            					to mature female intellect in the happiest manner—rural life, and domestic
            					intercourse at once polished, intellectual, and affectionate. The four years
            					prior to his death were spent at Bath; and after that event, she resided with
            					her mother and sister in the pleasant village of Shawton, Hants; from thence
            she
            					sent her novels into the world, and there, in May 1817, she died, after a slow
            					insidious decline of many months. She was only forty-two when this event
            					occurred, and though some of her works had been the gradual composition of her
            					previous life, she was upwards of thirty before the first ('Sense and
            					Sensibility') was published. For those who may doubt the possibility of
            					engrafting literary habits on those peculiarly set apart for the female sex,
            and
            					for those who may doubt how far literary reputation is attainable, without a
            					greater sacrifice to notoriety than they may deem compatible with female
            					happiness and delicacy, it is pleasant to have so triumphant a reference as <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>. Being dead, she may be
            					quoted without impropriety. Placed by Providence in easy and elegant
            					circumstances—endowed preeminently with good sense, and a placid
            					unobtrusive temperament, she passed unscathed through the ordeals of authorship,
            					and, in addition to exciting enthusiastic affection in immediate friends,
            					received the general good-will of all who knew her. This alone is a high tribute
            					to the benevolence of her temper, and the polish of her manners in daily life;
            					for in print, her peculiar forte is delineating folly, selfishness, and
            					absurdity—especially in her own sex. In society, she had too much wit to
            					lay herself open to the charge of being too witty; and discriminated too well
            to
            					attract notice to her discrimination. She was, we suspect, like one of her own
            					heroines, "incurably gentle," and acted on the principle of another,
            					that "if a women have the misfortune of knowing anything, she should
            					conceal it as well as she can."<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> Besides this, whilst literature was a delightful
            					occupation, it was not a profession to <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss
               						Austen</a>; she was not irrational enough to despise reputation and profit
            					when they sought her, but she became an authoress entirely from taste and
            					inclination; and as her judgment made her severely critical before she published
            					her works, her unambitious temper was amply satisfied with the attention
            					bestowed upon them by the public.
         </p>
         <p>Unlike that of many writers, <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss
               						Austen</a>&amp;s fame has grown fastest since she died; there was no <span class="italics">éclat</span> about her first, or second, or third
            					appearance; the public took time to make up its mind; and she, not having staked
            					her hopes of happiness on success or failure, and not being obliged by
            					circumstances to stake something more tangible on these results, could afford
            to
            					wait for the decision of her claims. Those claims have long been established
            					beyond a question; but the merit of <span class="italics">first</span>
            					recognizing them, belongs less to reviewers than to general readers.
         </p>
         <p>The able article in the <span class="italics">Quarterly
               						Review</span> for 1821, was founded on a posthumous work, when the
            					praise or blame of ten thousand critics were equally unimportant to the author.
            					So retired, so unmarked by literary notoriety, was the life <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a> led, that if any likeness
            					was ever taken of her, (and the contrary supposition would seem strange,) none
            					has ever been engraved; and of no woman, whose writings are as numerous and
            					distinguished, is there perhaps so little public beyond the circle of those who
            					knew her when alive— </p>

               <table>

         </p>
         <p>With regard to her genius, we must adventure a few remarks. She herself compares
            					her productions to a little bit of ivory two inches wide, worked upon with a
            					brush so fine that little effect is produced after much labour.<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> It is so; her
            					portraits are perfect likenesses, admirably finished, many of them gems, but
            it
            					is all miniature-painting; and, satisfied with being inimitable in one line,
            she
            					never essayed canvas and oils—never tried her hand at a majestic daub. Her
            					"two inches of ivory" just describes her preparations for a tale of
            					three volumes. A village—two families connected together—three or
            					four interlopers, out of whom are to spring a little <span class="italics">tracaserie</span>—a village or a country town, and by means of village
            					and country town visiting and gossiping, a real plot shall thicken, and its
            					"rear of darkness"<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> never be scattered till six pages off <span class="italics">Finis</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> The plots are simple in
            					construction, and yet intricate in developement;—the main characters,
            					those that the reader feels sure are to love, marry, and make mischief, are
            					introduced in the first or second chapter; the work is all done by half a dozen
            					people; no person, scene, or sentence, is ever introduced needless to the matter
            					in hand—no catastrophes, or discoveries, or surprises of a grand nature
            					are allowed—neither children nor fortunes are lost or found by
            					accident—the mind is never taken off the level surface of life—the
            					reader breakfasts, dines, walks, and gossips, with the various worthies, till
            a
            					process of transmutation takes place in him, and he absolutely fancies himself
            					one of the company. Yet the winding up of the plots involves a surprise; a few
            					incidents are entangled at the beginning in the most simple and natural manner,
            					and till the close one never feels quite sure how they are to be disentangled.
            					Disentangled, however, they are, and that in a most satisfactory manner. The
            					secret is, <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a> was a thorough
            					mistress in the knowledge of human character; how it is acted upon by education
            					and circumstance; and how, when once formed, it shows itself through every hour
            					of every day, and in every speech to every person. Her conversations would be
            					tiresome but for this; and her personages, the fellows to whom may be met in
            the
            					streets or drank tea with at half an hour's notice, would excite no
            					interest. But in <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>n's
            					hands we see into their hearts and hopes, their motives, their struggles within
            					themselves; and a sympathy is induced, which, if extended to daily life and the
            					world at large, would make the reader a more amiable person. We think some of
            					Miss Austen's works deficient in delineations of a high cast of character,
            					in an exalted tone of thought and feeling, a religious bias that can be seen
            as
            					well as understood; <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>
            					seemed afraid of imparting imagination to her favourites, and conceived good
            					sense the <span class="italics">ultima Thule</span><span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span> of moral possessions. Good
            					sense <span class="italics">is</span> very good, but St. Leon's
            					Marguerite, and Rebecca, and Desdemona,<span class="sup"><a href="#9" id="back9"><sup>9</sup></a> </span> and many other
            					glorious shadows of the brain, possessed something more. However, the author
            of
            						'Pride and Prejudice,' &amp;c., limited herself to
            					this every-day world; and to return to the point of view in which her books
            					yield moral benefit, we must think it a reader's own fault who does not
            					close her pages with more charity in his heart towards unpretending, if prosing
            					worth—with a higher estimation of simple kindness and sincere
            					good-will—with a quickened sense of the duty of bearing and forbearing in
            					domestic intercourse, and of the pleasure of adding to the little comforts even
            					of persons who are neither wits nor beauties—who, in a word, does not feel
            					more disposed to be benevolent. Miss Bates and her mother, Mrs. Jennings, old
            					Mrs. Musgrave, all the foils who with half, or at most three quarters of an
            					idea, are humble in their ignorance and happy in their simplicity—then the
            					fools, who are only too life-like, from Mr. Rushworth and his "forty-two
            					speeches" out of 'Lovers Vows,' to Sir Walter Elliot, who hates
            					the naval profession because it enables plebeians to fight their way to a title,
            					and makes a man mahogany-colour before he is forty—then her worldly
            					selfish people, who are delightful and benevolent everywhere but where it is
            					their first duty, or at every one's expense but their own—Mrs.
            					Elton's pretension, Aunt Norris's second-hand charity, all are
            					inimitable. Characters of another grade, those very troublesome persons to draw,
            					heroes and heroines, have in <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss
               						Austen</a>'s pages spirit and reality. The hero is not a suit of
            					fashionable clothes, and a set of fashionable phrases; the heroine is not a
            					ball-dress, a fainting fit, and a volume of poetry; they too are taken from
            					life, and are distinguished one from another. Caroline Morland, artless and
            					sometimes a little awkward; Emma Woodhouse, clever, spoiled, candid, faulty,
            and
            					yet delightful; Fanny Price, with her meekness and humility, her loving,
            					loveable, and most forgiving temper, her weeping-willow spirit that principle
            					strengthens into decision and self-dependence—none of these are alike, and
            					none appeal to our good graces by virtue of any qualities that sisters and
            					cousins in real life may not and do not possess. We sometimes feel that <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>'s works deal rather
            					too largely with the commonplace, petty, and disagreeable side of human
            					nature—that we should enjoy more frequent sketches of the wise and
            					high-hearted—that some of the books are too completely pages out of the
            					world. In the last posthumous tale ('Persuasion') there
            					is a strain of a higher mood; there is still the exquisite delineation of common
            					life, such life as we hear, and see, and make part of, with the addition of a
            					finer, more poetic, yet equally real tone of thought and action in the
            					principals. <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a> was sparing
            					in her introduction of nobler characters, for they are scattered sparingly in
            					life, but the books in which she describes them most we like most; they may not
            					amuse so much at the moment, but they interest more deeply and more happily.
            In
            					many respects <a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a> resembled
            						<a href="people.html#CrabbeGeorge">Crabbe</a>: she had not his genius
            					for grappling with the passions, and forcing them to pass before the reader in
            					living, suffering, bodily forms—but <a href="people.html#CrabbeGeorge">Crabbe</a> in his lighter moods, unveiling the surface of things, playing
            					with the follies of man, and even dealing seriously with such of his minor
            					faults as all flesh is heir to. <a href="people.html#CrabbeGeorge">Crabbe</a> himself, when not describing the terrible, is scarcely
            					superior to the accomplished subject of this article. Her death has made a chasm
            					in our light literature, the domestic novel with its home-borne incidents, its
            					"familiar matter of to-day,"<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> its slight array of
            					names and great cognizance of people and things, its confinement to country
            					life, and total oblivion of costume, manners, the</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 554]</p><p class="pnoindent"> great world, and
            					"the mirror of fashion."<span class="sup"><a href="#11" id="back11"><sup>11</sup></a> </span> Every species of composition, is, when good, to be
            					admired in its way; but the revival of the domestic novel would make a pleasant
            					interlude to the showy, sketchy, novels of high life. Hampshire (<a href="people.html#AustenJane">Miss Austen</a>'s county) still
            					possesses a female writer richly endowed with some of her predecessor's
            					qualifications for this species of writing, and possessing on her own account
            a
            					higher faculty of imagination. We allude to <a href="people.html#SoutheyCaroline">Caroline Bowles</a>.
