                  Bage</span></a>, Esq., the author of several novels which have met with a
            favourable reception from the public, was born in the year 1728 at Derby, where
            his father worked a paper-mill. Being intended for the same business, he had no
            other advantages than a common school education; but he was early distinguished
            for the vigour of his intellectual powers, and his love for knowledge. When
            arrived at maturity he married, and settled at Elford, a village a few miles
            from Tamworth in Warwickshire, where he set up a paper-mill, which he conducted
            to the day of his death.
         </p>
         <p>A man is seldom so closely employed in business as not to have leisure for
            reading, if he has acquired a love for it. <a href="people.html#BageRobert">Mr. Bage</a> taught himself the modern languages; and being inclined when
            about thirty to learn the more abstruse branches of mathematics, he engaged a
            teacher at Birmingham, where he spent an evening every week for the purpose of
            instruction.
         </p>
         <p>Living in a retired situation, and always a man of business, though his company
            was much sought after by those who knew him, it was not </p>

            his works show more of thought than of refinement.—He is said to have
            first applied to his pen in order to divert his thoughts from a heavy pecuniary
            loss, which fell upon him in consequence of a partnership in an iron manufactory
            which he unfortunately engaged in.—He gave to the world <span class="italics">Mount Heneth; </span><span class="italics">Barham Downs; </span><span class="italics">The Fair Syrian</span>; <span class="italics">James Wallace; </span><span class="italics">Hermsprong, or Man as He Is Not; </span>
            and <span class="italics">Man as He Is</span>.
         </p>
         <p>Of these, <span class="italics">Hermsprong</span> is democratical
            in its tendency. It was published at a time when sentiments of that nature were
            prevalent with a large class of people, and it was much read. It has some
            strength of thought; but it is far from being a regular work, or exhibiting a
            consistent character. <span class="italics">Man as He Is</span>
            has more of a story, and more variety of character. Sir George Paradyne, the
            hero, is a young man of fortune, with noble and generous feelings and of a
            philosophical turn; but, being <span class="italics">Man as he is</span>, he is
            not able entirely to resist the temptations of fortune and gay company, by which
            he is drawn for a time into a course of dissipation: from this he is rescued by
            the representations of his tutor and the influence of honourable love; his
            mistress, who is a young lady of the most delicate feelings, refusing him her
            hand, though much his inferior in fortune, till he is brought to a more sober
            way of thinking. The character of Lady Paradyne, his mother, a vain, selfish,
            fine lady, fond of her son, but teasing him with lectures, is drawn with some
            humour. But the best sustained character is that of Miss Carlill, a quaker, </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">in which the author has
            exceedingly well hit off the acutneness and presence of mind, and coolness in
            argument, by which the society she is supposed to belong to are so much
            distinguished. In her dialogue with a high-church clergyman, she is made to have
            as much the better of the argument as the late <a href="people.html#KnowlesMary">Mrs. Knowles</a> was said to have had in
            a debate with <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>. It is
            easy to see how much the author delights himself in the dry humour and poignant
            retorts by which she is made to support her argument. One of the most affecting
            incidents in these volumes is the sudden discovery of Mr. Mowbray's insanity.
            The whole is the work of a man who knows the world, and has reflected upon what
            he has seen; of a man whose mind has more strength than elegance; and whose
            opinions, often just, sometimes striking, are marked with traits of singularity,
            and not unfrequently run counter to received notions and established
            usages.
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#BageRobert">Mr. Bage</a> died in 1801, at the age of
            seventy-three. He left behind him a high character for integrity and
            benevolence. His friends seem to have been much attached to him. They describe
            his temper as open, mild, and sociable. He is said to have been very kind to his
            domestics, who lived with him till they were old, and even to his horses, when
            they were past work. He was happy in his matrimonial connexion, and left two
            sons: one promising youth died before him.
