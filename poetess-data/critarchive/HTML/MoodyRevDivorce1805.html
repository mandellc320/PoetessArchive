         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">O</span><span class="smcaps">f</span> all the absurd and capricious institutions which France, under
            					either her old or her new <span class="italics">Régime</span>, has
            					dignified by the name of <span class="italics">Law</span>, the modern divorce
            					claims the pre-eminence for cruelty and injustice;—at least, if Madame <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span>’s relation is to be
            					accredited.—Mme. <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span> was a beautiful
            					and accomplished young woman, and married to a handsome and well-informed young
            					man. Six years of perfect happiness they enjoyed together, and perhaps Hymen
            					thought this was as large a portion of felicity as he commonly allows; for after
            					this period, a degree of languor and insipidity is too often found consequent
            on
            					a state of uninterrupted tranquility. Mons. <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span> required variety, and sought it in the scenes of dissipation;
            					and hence proceeded those vicious and libertine pursuits which never fail to
            					undermine the conjugal affection. Among other depravities, the <span class="italics">French Husband</span> had a mistress whom he wished to
            					marry; and, as the Legislature had so easily and so conveniently devised the
            					means of breaking old chains, and forging new, he resolved on availing himself
            					of so desirable a privilege, and being divorced from his amiable and most
            					affectionate wife. Madame <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span> protests
            					against the divorce, with an obstinacy as inflexible as was that of <a href="people.html#CatherineofAragon">Catherine of Arragon</a>:—she
            					protested against all the formalities necessary to ascertain the separation,
            and
            					she insisted on keeping the name and arms of <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span>, and on being the true and </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 540]</p><p class="pnoindent">lawful wife of the old
            					Régime:—she was, however, divorced against her consent, and Monsieur
            					married his new Love.
         </p>
         <p> Of this connection, also, the inconstant husband grew tired; and he felt the
            					same inclination to be emancipated from the second captivity, which had induced
            					him to break the first. The matter being so easily adjusted, and the remedy for
            					matrimonial ennui so immediately at hand, <span class="italics">Dormeuil</span>
            					is a second time <span class="italics">divorced</span>; and with his first wife
            					he became once more desperately in love. Her affections were never alienated
            					from him, but stood the brunt of all his cruelties with the most persevering
            					affection:— but the same firmness, which had directed her conduct in
            					opposing the divorce, now supported her in refusing to renew the <span class="italics">ci-devant</span> nuptial vow; since that act would have
            					been acknowleging the <span class="italics">legality of the divorce</span>,
            					which she had with so much pertinacity refused to sanction. The situation of
            					Monsieur and Madame now becomes whimsically laughable; they love each other to
            					distraction: but they must not live together, and renew the conjugal
            					endearments, because she <span class="italics">is not his wife</span>, and
            					would be liable to be considered as his mistress; and it would be a breach of
            					good morality, which would necessarily implicate her reputation on the ground
            of
            					decorum, were they again to inhabit the same house. We leave the reader to Mme.
            						<span class="italics">Dormeuil</span>’s own description of the caprices of
            					her destiny; which she details with refined and romantic sentiments of prudery,
            					truly <span class="italics">French, and extremely artificial and
               						unnatural</span>.
         </p>
         <p> The author informs us that he suppressed the publication of the second of these
            					novels for some time, because he dared not to print it, lest a resemblance might
            					be discovered between the characters which he describes, and those which
            					personally existed when it was written. We have only to observe on this <span class="italics">head</span>, that we give him credit for his prudence in
            					taking care of his <span class="italics">own</span>. In this novel, as in most
            					others, Love is the burden of the song; and the cabals of politics, the union
            of
            					party, and the enthusiasm of patriotism, are all superseded by the irresistible
            					control of the little deity. The lovely and innocent Adéle exchanged the
            					horrors of a prison for the arms of an affectionate husband, and was without
            					doubt very well pleased with the bargain: at the same time, the <span class="italics">revolutionist</span> most probably preserved himself from
            					the guillotine by his amorous apostacy. Love was therefore the protector of
            					both.
         </p>
         <p> The third story exhibits those romantic and self-denying practices, which the
            					writers of novels dignify with the name of heroism. Our days of romance,
            					however, have been so long past, that we are utterly incapable of deciding on
            					the </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 541]</p><p class="pnoindent">merits or demerits of these sentimental heroines; who inflict so much misery
            					on themselves, by erecting the standard of virtue on false principles.
         </p>
         <p> M. <span class="smcaps">Fiévée</span>’s novels are agreeably written,
            					in correct and elegant French; and, altogether, they are interesting and
            					affecting.
