         <p class=""><span class="largest">T</span>O readers of taste it would be superfluous to
            point out the beauties of <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs
               Inchbald</a>'s novels. The <span class="italics">Simple
               Story</span> has obtained the decided approbation of the best
            judges. There is an originality both in the characters and the situations which
            is not often found in similar productions. To call it a <span class="italics">simple story</span> is perhaps a misnomer, since the first and second parts
            are in fact two distinct stories, connected indeed by the character of
            Dorriforth, which they successively serve to illustrate. 
         </p>
         <p> Dorriforth is introduced as a Romish priest of a lofty mind, generous, and
            endued with strong sensibilities, but having in his disposition much of
            sternness and inflexibility. His being in priest's orders presents an
            apparently insurmountable obstacle to his marriage; but it is got over, without
            violating probability, by his becoming heir to a title and estate, and on that
            account receiving a dispensation from his vows. Though slow to entertain
            thoughts of love, as soon as he perceives the partiality of his ward, it enters
            his breast like a torrent when the flood-gates are opened. The perplexities in
            which he is involved by Miss Milner's gay unthinking conduct bring them to
            the very brink of separating for ever; and very few scenes in any novel have a
            finer effect than the intended parting of the lovers, </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page ii]</p><p class="pnoindent">and their sudden,
            immediate, unexpected marriage. 
         </p>
         <p> It is impossible not to sympathize with the feelings of Miss Milner, when she
            sees the corded trunks standing in the passage; or again, when after their
            reconciliation she sees the carriage, which was to take away her lover, drive
            empty from the door. The character of the ward of Dorriforth is so drawn as to
            excite an interest such as we seldom feel for more faultless characters. Young,
            sprightly, full of sensibility, gay and thoughtless, we feel such a tenderness
            for her as we should for a child who is playing on the brink of a precipice. The
            break between the first and second parts of the story has a singularly fine
            effect. We pass over in a moment a large space of years, and find every thing
            changed: scenes of love and conjugal happiness are vanished; and for the young,
            gay, thoughtless, youthful beauty, we see a broken-hearted penitent on her
            death-bed. 
         </p>
         <p> This sudden shifting of the scene has an effect which no continued narrative
            could produce; an effect which even the scenes of real life could not produce;
            for the curtain of futurity is lifted up only by degrees, and we must wait the
            slow succession of months and years to bring about events which are here
            presented close together. The death-bed letter of Lady Milner is very solemn,
            and cannot be perused without tears. 
         </p>
         <p> Dorriforth in these latter volumes is become, from the contemplation of his
            injuries, morose, unrelenting, and tyrannical. How far it was possible for a man
            to resist the strong impulse of nature, and deny himself the sight of his </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">child residing in the same house with him, the reader will
            determine; but the situation is new and striking. 
         </p>
         <p> It is a particular beauty in <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs.
               Inchbald</a>'s compositions, that they are thrown so much into the
            dramatic form. There is little of mere narrative, and in what there is of it,
            the style is careless; but all the interesting parts are carried on in
            dialogue:â€”we see and hear the persons themselves; we are but little led to
            think of the author, and it is only when we have done feeling that we being to
            admire. 
         </p>
         <p> The only other novel which Mrs. <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs.
               Inchbald</a> has given to the public is <span class="italics">Nature and Art</span>. It is of a slighter texture than the
            former, and put together without much attention to probability; the
            author's object being less to give a regular story, than to suggest
            reflections on the political and moral state of society. For this purpose two
            youths are introduced, one of whom is educated in all the ideas and usages of
            civilized life; the other (the child of Nature) without any knowledge of or
            regard to them. This is the frame which has been used by Mr. Day and others for
            the same purpose, and naturally tends to introduce remarks more lively than
            solid, and strictures more epigrammatic than logical, on the differences between
            rich and poor, the regard paid to rank, and such topics, on which it is easy to
            dilate with an appearance of reason and humanity; while it requires a much
            profounder philosophy to suggest any alteration in the social system, which
            would not be rather Utopian than beneficial. 
         </p>
         <hr></hr>
         <p class="pageNumber">[Page iv]</p>
         <p> There is a beautiful stroke in this part of the work, where Henry, who,
            according to Rousseau's plan, had not been taught to pray till he was of an
            age to know what he was doing, kneels down for the first time with great
            emotion; and on being asked if he was not afraid to speak to God, says, "To
            be sure I trembled very much when I first knelt, but when I came to the words
            'Our Father who art in heaven,' they gave me courage, for I know how
            kind a father is." 
         </p>
         <p> But by far the finest passage in this novel is the meeting between Hannah and
            her seducer, when he is seated as judge upon the bench, and, without
            recollecting the former object of his affection, pronounces sentence of death
            upon her. The shriek she gives, and her exclamation, "Oh, not from
            you!" electrifies the reader, and cannot but stir the coldest feelings. 
         </p>
         <p> Judgement and observation may sketch characters, and often put together a good
            story; but strokes of pathos, such as the one just mentioned, or the dying-scene
            in <a href="people.html#OpieAmelia">Mrs. Opie</a>'s <span class="italics">Father and Daughter</span>, can only be
            attained by those whom nature has endowed with her choicest gifts. 
         </p>
         <p> One cannot help wishing the author had been a little more liberal of happiness
            to poor Henry, who sits down contented with poverty and his half-withered
            Rebecca. 
         </p>
         <p> There is another wish the public has often formed, namely, that these two
            productions were not the <span class="italics">only</span> novels of such a
            writer as <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs. Inchbald</a>.
