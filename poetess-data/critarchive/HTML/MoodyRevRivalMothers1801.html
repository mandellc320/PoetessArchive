         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">T</span><span class="smcaps">he</span> literary reputation of <a href="people.html#GenlisStephanie">Madame de Genlis</a> is so well established, that the public are readily
            					disposed to anticipate pleasure from every new production of her cultivated
            					mind; and we have satisfaction in acknowledging, after having perused the
            					volumes before us, that disappointment has not superseded expectation. We regret
            					that this ingenious lady should have had reason for complaining of the insidious
            					enemy <span class="italics">Calumny</span>: but, if she has been enabled to
            					support its injustice with the fortitude inspired by conscious innocence, (such
            					as she de-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 187]</p><p class="pnoindent">scribes to be the recompense of the injured Pauline,) she will not (as
            					a moralist) regret the experience, whatever painful sensations it may have
            					occasioned.
         </p>
         <p> The <span class="italics">Rival Mothers</span> are two ladies who enter the
            					lists of competition on the subject of maternal affection. If they do not stand
            					on fair and equal ground respecting pretension, since they cannot both be the
            					mother, they meet at least on the point of conduct. Each makes an important
            					sacrifice to the little idol Léocadie:— the sacrifice of <span class="italics">reputation</span> is offered by one to the preservation
            					of the infant; and that of parental intercourse and endearment is endured by
            the
            					other, for the <span class="italics">maintenance of her reputation</span>. Yet,
            					as the latter incessantly demonstrates, by the frequent testimonials of
            					unremitting superintendence, that her heart never relaxes on the affectionate
            					interests of maternal love and duty, Solomon himself might have been puzzled
            to
            					decide which was the real parent; while the extravagant personal fondness of
            					Pauline might have contributed to impose on even his sagacity. 
         </p>
         <p> The narrative of the novel is pleasing and interesting. The characters, indeed,
            					are delineated <span class="italics">à la française</span>; and
            					exceptions consequently arise against a few occasional tints of unnatural
            					colouring; which, by overstepping the modesty of nature, gives too much the
            					semblance of romance to the work, and is not adapted to that species of writing
            					in which, the author tells us, the story is meant as a vehicle to convey the
            					principles of sound and pure morality. We also differ from <a href="people.html#GenlisStephanie">Madame de Genlis</a> on the subject
            					of reputation. Her heroine, Pauline, stands chargeable with gross
            					inconsistencies on this head. She is represented as tremblingly alive to general
            					sensibility on the subject of virtue, yet she is apparently indifferent to its
            					appropriate estimation in the opinion of others; and she throws away her good
            					name, "as 'twere a careless trifle."—She is attacked by the
            					grossest calumny:—accused of adultery, hypocrisy, and falsehood;—
            					yet she writes to her friend—''<span class="italics">Do not
               						bewail the loss of my reputation</span>; <span class="italics">it is of all
               						the illusions of life, that which I regret the least and despise the
               						most.</span>' Of what value, then, is the jewel reputation; if such
            					apathy, is to be attached to it?—By this indifference to character, <a href="people.html#GenlisStephanie">Madame de Genlis</a> loses sight of
            					her professedly supreme object, the encouragement and improvement of morals;
            					since the desire of being esteemed by the world, if it ought not to be the <span class="italics">primum mobile</span> of our actions, must at least be
            					admitted as a stimulating principle, without which the current of virtue would
            					be liable to stagnate. Though often a charming <span class="italics">human
               						creature</span>, this lady is but too apt to degenerate into a <span class="italics">French court lady;</span> one moment, we admire her; the
            					next, we despise the formal painted wooden </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 188]</p><p class="pnoindent">doll. We turn with disgust from the
            					allegoric garden, the romantic machinery, and the theatrical personifications;
            					and we would also gladly erase the many unnatural events that crowd her novel:
            					yet let us remember that French and English <span class="italics">Nature</span>
            					differs, and that the author is acquainted only with the former;— whom we
            					consider as a degenerate goddess. 
         </p>
         <p> The style of these letters is sprightly and animated, bidding defiance to the
            					foul fiend <span class="italics">Ennui</span>.—The translator of a work
            					of this kind finds it almost impossible to transfuse into another language that
            					spirit and vivacity, with that beautiful and elegant <span class="italics">tour de phrase</span>, which so peculiarly characterize the French writers of
            					eminence; and mere fidelity produces flatness and insipidity. In many passages,
            					however, the present translator is successful in catching a ray of the author’s
            					illuminated pencil; and the version of the ingenious lines with the <span class="italics">double sens</span>, found in the oratory, is extremely
            					well executed.
