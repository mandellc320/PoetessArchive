            <dd> Joanna Baillie stands as the most significant Romantic period British
               						woman playwright as well as being one of the period"s most notable
               						women critics. Scottish by birth, Baillie moved about with her family after
               						her father's death until her brother inherited a London medical
               						practice from his uncle. Eventually settling in Hampstead, Baillie widened
               						her circle of literary acquaintances to include numerous prominent figures.
               						Her own first publication was an anonymous volume, <span class="italics">Poems: Wherein It Is Attempted to Describe Certain Views of
                  								Nature and Rustic Manners, Etc.</span> (1790). The first
               						volume of <span class="italics">A Series of Plays: In Which It Is
                  								Attempted to Delineate the Stronger Passions of the Mind. Each
                  								Passion Being the Subject of a Tragedy and a Comedy</span>
               						(1798), with its "Introductory Discourse," was also
               						published anonymously, sparking much speculation about the author. Baillie
               						added additional volumes to this work in 1802 and 1812, with this final
               						volume featuring the preface "To the Reader."
               						Another collection, <span class="italics">Miscellaneous
                  								Plays</span>, appeared in 1804 and included her tragedy <span class="italics">Romiero</span>, which she defended in
               							<span class="italics">Fraser's Magazine</span>
               						(December 1836). Baillie meant her plays for the stage, but though they were
               						widely read, only <span class="italics">De Monfort</span>
               						was much staged. Nevertheless, Baillie continued her project, adding more
               						plays and extending some of those already published, until 1836, when her
               						three volume collection <span class="italics">Dramas</span>
               						appeared. Along with drama and dramatic theory, Baillie published narrative
               						poetry, including <span class="italics">Metrical Legends of
                  								Exalted Characters</span> (1821). <span class="italics">Ahalya Baee</span>, another narrative poem, appeared
               						in 1849. She also published a theological tract, <span class="italics">A View of the General Tenour of the New
                  							Testament</span>, examining the nature and dignity of Jesus Christ
               						(1831). Finally she agreed to the Longmans' request to collect and edit

                  								Poetical Works of Joanna Baillie, Complete in One

               						(1773). After she married dissenting clergyman Rochemont Barbauld and the

               						up through at least 1815. Her reviews probably included contributions to the

               						she operated under the pseudonym "Mary Singleton, Spinster," and
               						that was reprinted as a single volume in 1764. This periodical staging
               						interactions between a vivid central voice, the perspectives of other
               						contributors (probably fictional), and reader correspondence (much of which
               						may also have been fictional), it is no surprise that her first full-length
               						literary effort was a drama, <span class="italics">Virginia: A
                  								Tragedy</span> (1756), which she was unable to get staged. Her
               						first two novels similarly capitalized on dramatic dialog skills in their
               						epistolary form. The first, <span class="italics">The History of
                  								Lady Julia Mandeville</span> (1763), was issued anonymously.
               						It was quite successful, going through multiple editions in its first year.
               						Around the time of its publication, Brooke left England, the country where
               						she was born and lived her early life, to join her husband, who was serving
               						in Canada as part of the British army. <span class="italics">The
                  								History of Emily Montague</span> by"the Author of Lady
               						Julia Mandeville"(1769) capitalizes on her Canadian experiences. Though
               						not as succesful as her previous novel, this one was also well received and
               						is lauded by some as the first Canadian novel. A second anonymous Canadian
               						novel, <span class="italics">All's Right at Last</span>
               						(1774), has tentatively been attributed to Brooke largely on the basis of
               						its subject matter. <span class="italics">The

               						manager <a href="#GarrickDavid">David Garrick</a>, followed next. At

            <dd>Born Charlotte Ramsay, Lennox is known as a versatile woman of letters,

               							<a href="#GoldsmithOliver">Oliver Goldsmith</a>, and <a href="#BurneyFanny">Fanny Burney</a>. She is best remembered for her
               						1752 novel <span class="italics">The Female Quixote; or, The
                  								Adventures of Arabella</span>, an update and parody of <a href="#Cervantes">Cervantes</a>'s <span class="italics">Don Quixote</span>, though in the case of
               								<span class="italics">The Female Quixote</span> the
               						heroine's delusions are set in motion by her voluminous reading of
               						recent French fiction. It was preceded by <span class="italics">The Life of Harriot Stuart</span> (1751), Lennox's first
               						novel, and by <span class="italics">Poems on Several Occasions,
                  								Written by a Young Lady</span> (1747), her first publication.
               						Her next novel, <span class="italics">Henrietta</span>
               						(1758), took a story by <a href="#Marivaux">Marivaux</a> for its
               						model. It was popular enough that Lennox adapteded it for the stage as
               								<span class="italics">The Sister</span>, but the
               						play survived only one performance in 1769. Meanwhile, Lennox began a career
               						of editing and translating, including <span class="italics">Shakespear Illustrated</span> (1753-1754), which collects
               						novels and stories from which <a href="#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespeare</a> drew many of his plots. She also produced an essay
               						periodical, the <span class="italics">Lady's
                  							Museum</span> (1760-1) under the pseudonym "The
               						Trifler". Though not the only woman writer of this time to run a
               						periodical, she was something of an innovator, partly because with a title
               						page blazoning "by the author of <span class="italics">The
                  								Female Quixote</span>" anonymity was a mere fiction, and
               						partly for use of the forum to serialize her next novel, <span class="italics">Sophia</span> (1762), which appeared in
               						the <span class="italics">Lady's Museum</span> under
               						the title "The History of Harriot and Sophia" from 1760-1.
               						Lennox's play <span class="italics">Old City
                  							Manners</span> (1775) was much more successful than her previous
               						drama. Her final and far less successful novel <span class="italics">Euphemia</span> (1790) was her first
               						attempt at the epistolary form. Lennox completed a number of translations,

            <dd> Poet and historian James Macpherson is best known for his “translations”
               						of the Gaelic epic poems by the fictitious ancient bard Ossian. Though the
               						authenticity of these poems came under attack almost immediately, they
               						nevertheless exerted a powerful influence on the British Romantic literature
               						that soon followed. Born in a small town in the Scottish highlands,
               						Macpherson began his career collecting, then translating Gaelic verse, and
               						was encouraged by literary antiquarian Hugh Blair to publish some of these
               						efforts as <span class="italics">Fragments of Ancient Poetry,
                  								Collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and Translated from the
                  								Galic or Erse Language</span> (1760). Supported by funds
               						contributed in response to this publication, Macpherson set out to search
               						for ancient Celtic poetry, returning with the alleged third century epics
               							<span class="italics">Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six
                  								Books: Together with Several Other Poems</span> (1761) and <span class="italics">Temora, an Ancient Epic Poem, in Eight
                  								Books: Together with Several Other Poems</span> (1763), both
               						professedly "Composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal" and translated by
               						Macpherson. The authenticity of Macpherson’s Celtic works was vehemently
               						debated during his lifetime, but only after his death was it determined that
               						the poems consisted partly of some Gaelic verse dating as far back as the
               						fifteenth century and partly of Macpherson’s own material. Macpherson’s
               						historiography and political writing includes <span class="italics">An Introduction to the History of Great Britain and
                  								Ireland</span> (1771); <span class="italics">The

               						title of First Consul of the French Republic. In 1804 he was crowned Emperor
               						of France, leading the French to military conquest over most of Europe. He
               						reigned as Emperor until April 1814, when he was forced by the allied
               						European armies to abdicate. Exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba, he
               						remained only until his escape in February 1815, when he returned to France
               						to resume his title of Emperor. In June of that year he was defeated at the
               						Battle of Waterloo and exiled once again, this time to the Atlantic island
               						of Saint Helena, where he remained until his death. His legacy is mixed; he

            <dd>Poet and novelist Charlotte Turner Smith provides an unusual example of a
               						Romantic period woman who began as a coterie poet, but out of necessity
               						became a professional writer. Charlotte Turner was born into a well-to-do
               						family, but after the early death of her mother, she was consigned first to
               						the care of an aunt, then to boarding school. Soon after she reached her
               						teens, her father remarried, and having thus become an inconvenience,
               						Charlotte was married off at the age of fifteen to the dissipated,
               						unfaithful, and violent Benjamin Smith, who kept the family perpetually in
               						debt and with whom she ultimately bore twelve children. The groom's
               						father clearly understood his son's nature, for at his death he left a
               						significant fortune specifically for his daughter-in-law and grandchildren.
               						The will was so complex, however, that the money was tied up in litigation
               						until after both Charlotte and her husband were dead and the children
               						matured. In the meantime, Smith's husband was consigned to prison for
               						debt, where she joined him, there composing poetry for sale in an attempt to
               						relieve their financial distress. The result was <span class="italics">Elegiac Sonnets, and Other Essays</span> (1784), which
               						was revised and enlarged numerous times until 1797 and eventually included
               						prefatory essays that delineate principles of sonnet composition. Though she
               						separated from her husband soon after, Smith continued to support herself,
               						her children, and to some extent her estranged spouse through her writing.
               						She first tried translating, and then in 1788 she published her first novel,
               							<span class="italics">Emmeline, the Orphan of the
