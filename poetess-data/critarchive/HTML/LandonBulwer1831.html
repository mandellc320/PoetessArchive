         <p><span class="largest">T</span><span class="smcaps">he</span> great first cause
            					why our English literature has obtained so high a character for truth and nature
            					is, that it has always reflected, as in a mirror, the age which was passing over
            					it. The chivalric romances were filled with the spirit of their times. The
            					dramas, with their passionate poetry and rich variety of incident, were
            					transcripts of their own wild and adventurous day. The Revolution next left its
            					mental imprint. <a href="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</a> embodied the
            					stern energy of resistance which had been in action, while the satire of
            						"Hudibras,"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> and the light and licentious comedies
            					which followed, were no less faithful pictures of the wit and profligate
            					indulgence which then prevailed. The ensuing age was one of political intrigue
            					rather than of excitement. It equally gave its literary tone. People reasoned
            					rather than felt, were moral by maxims, and witty in antithesis. The genius of
            					style was abroad. Observation was just rather than profound, keen rather than
            					deep. Wit was carried to its perfection, and also to its excess; people were
            					witty on every thing. Essays, letters, satires, sermons, were the circulating
            					coin. The novels, excellent in plot, coarse, but vigorous in delineation of
            					character, were comedies put into narrative, their merits and their defects
            					equally of their actual period. This cycle also revolved, and its successor was
            					one of wild imagination and strong passion. The few paint the feeling of the
            					many; and the many adopt such words as if they were their own. The great
            					writers, we can scarcely say of our time, embodied the excitement, the morbid
            					sensibility, the visionary philosophy, the melancholy ever attendant upon
            					imaginative feeling, which were the characteristics of an essentially poetical
            					age; and such was the one just departed. Another great change is now passing
            					over our literature, because it is also passing over our time; not less
            					powerful, though perhaps less marked. The former change was more violent; it
            was
            					wrought by enthusiasm, which, for the time, carries all before it. The present
            					is being worked by opinion, which, if more still, is also more lasting. To-day
            					has nothing in common with Yesterday. People required to be amused in order to
            					be instructed; now, they only permit themselves to be entertained while laying
            					the flattering unction to their souls that it is the vehicle of information.
            For
            					every why, we ask a wherefore. We will not allow an author to display his
            					talents merely as the knights broke each other's limbs of old, for honour:
            					we expect that he should have a purpose in this display, and that purpose one
            of
            					tangible benefit. It is this that makes the excellence of the writer before us.
            					With that keen perception of reality, which is the executive power of genius,
            he
            					has entered into the spirit of his own times. Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> is the first novelist
            					who has placed his best reward, and his great aim, in the utility of his
            					writings. He has seen, that in order to improve, we must first enlighten; and
            					that ridicule, if not the test of truth, is, at least, a good conductor to its
            					lightning. His genius has taken service with reality. In every event he has
            					wrought out, in every character he has created, he has never had the actual </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 438]</p><p class="pnoindent">out of mind; and his works are living pictures, filled with the
            					crimes and the virtues, the thoughts and the feelings, the hopes and the fears
            					which are now among us in daily operation. Young, rich, and high-born, Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a><span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> lacked many of the ordinary excitements to exertion. It
            					is a fact not to be disputed, that the aristocracy have not
            					"progressed" in proportion to the other classes. A young nobleman of
            					the present day has not a better education than his ancestor in the time of <a href="people.html#ElizabethIQueenofEngland">Elizabeth</a>. If we look
            					back to the old records, we shall find that the classics, the modern tongues,
            					some knowledge of philosophy, and the information collected by foreign travel,
            					were held indispensable to the formation of a gentleman. What more is now
            					required among the higher ranks? We doubt whether even as much be effected. It
            					would seem that education, in ceasing to be a distinction, had lost half its
            					attraction. The evaded study and dissipation of a public school is succeeded
            by
            					the equally evaded study and dissipation of a college; and too many of our
            					youthful aristocracy begin life with self-sufficiency for knowledge, prejudices
            					for opinions, and with pleasure a habit rather than an enjoyment. The great
            					error of their condition is, that their road through life is too royal a one,
            					using that phrase quite in its ancient acceptation. We must remember, that to
            					this class Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>
            					belongs, in order to do justice to the enegy of mind which has so nobly
            					preferred exertion to indulgence, and has set out by acknowledging the general
            					sympathies, and advocating the general rights of mankind. In the history of an
            					author, it is labour wasted to inquire what first turned his mind to its
            					peculiar pursuit. Even if the fact could be ascertained, it would be useless
            as
            					an example, for no circumstance affects two men alike; and if brought forward
            					only to support a theory, the theory which cannot be carried into action is
            					rather ingenious than useful. That the subject of our sketch was early addicted
            					to reading is nothing; so are thousands, from whose labour fruit never comes.
            					Literary taste is often confounded with literary talent by others, quite as much
            					as by ourselves. The Cambridge prize poem on Sculpture, afterwards published
            in
            					a small volume of poems, printed for private circumstance, was his first
            					literary effort.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> is essentially imbued
            					with the spirit of poetry: perhaps, born a few years sooner, he would have been
            					a poet only; but, though circumstances do not make genius, they certainly have
            					much to do with its direction. He had early read largely, and seen much of

            in
            					an opposite path by its successor. We had been rich in poetry, even to luxury;
            					and when has not luxury led to satiety? Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s literary career

            					into a rage with the author, whom they comforted themselves by denouncing as
            					"a coxcomb." One would think that irony was like the Delphin
            						classics,<span class="sup"><a href="#14" id="back14"><sup>14</sup></a> </span> and required notes of explanation. People
            					in general do not understand it. Matthews<span class="sup"><a href="#15" id="back15"><sup>15</sup></a> </span>tells a good story of this density of
            					apprehension:—a criminal, doomed to perish by the sharp edge of the law,
            					was willing that the edge should be really sharp. "I will give you fifty
            					ducats," said he to the executioner, "if you cut off my head at a
            					single stroke." In the pride of his art, the headsman gave a flourish with
            					his sword. "Fifty ducats," reiterated the criminal. "Just shake
            					your head," replied the executioner; he did so, and it rolled on the
            					scaffold. The matter-of-fact man, believing the story up to this point, says,
            					"Well, did he give him the fifty ducats?" In this <span class="italics">point device</span> spirit were the coxcombries of
            						"Pelham," arraigned. "Perfumes,
            					indeed—how effeminate!" "Almond paste!—I wonder of what
            					materials he thinks he must be made; soap would do for him as well as other
            					people." "Feeding his poodle on chicken and sweet-breads!—what
            					wicked waste, when there are so many poor starving." But wit cuts its
            					bright way through the glass-door of public favour; and
            						"Pelham," took its station, not only as a most
            					entertaining novel, but as a satire, equally just, keen, and amusing. By the
            					way, it is curious to remark how the affectations of one age are made up of the
            					affectations of its predecessors: our present has gone back upon classical
            					materials. What is its indifference, but stoicism made small for common use;
            its
            					indolence, but a copy of the Lacedemonian, who, when an Athenian had been fined
            					for idleness, requested to be introduced to the gentleman, "who had been
            					punished for keeping up his dignity;" its gourmandism is but the luxury,
            					without the magnificence of the Roman; and, as for perfumes, there was an
            					ancient sage who perfumed his feet instead of his hair. "In the one
            					case," as he justly observed, "the grateful odours ascended to his own
            					nostrils, while, in the other instance, the sweetness but exhaled in the general
            					air." Pelham was an incarnation of the spirit of the times, only with some
            					fine talents and high qualities not quite so general. But the author's own
            					words, in the preface to the second edition, best set forth his intentions.

         <p><a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Lord Byron</a> makes a very true remark
            					in one of his letters, that the most prolific authors have always been the most
            					popular. Such has certainly been the case with Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>. "The
            						Disowned," "Devereux,"
            						"Paul Clifford" "The Siamese
            						Twins," followed each other in rapid succession.<span class="sup"><a href="#18" id="back18"><sup>18</sup></a> </span> The most singular
            					characteristic about these works is their utter dissimilitude: save in a general
            					tone of benevolence, as the basis of philosophy, and an extended and liberal
            					view of the general interests of mankind, these productions are striking
            					contrasts. "Pelham," was a moral Diorama—a view
            					of London, as it is. "The Disowned" was a poetical and
            					imaginative picture, but not the less true because the colours were created and
            					combined rather than copied. It is not, perhaps, fair to ascribe your own
            					supposed plan to an author, but we have always thought that "The
            						Disowned" was the finest illustration of ambition
            					possible—an illustration, too, of its many varieties. The desire of
            					honourable but worldly success in Clarence, is brought into fine contrast with
            					the dreaming and feverish desire of fame which consumes the young artist. Again,
            					the disinterested but fatal patriotism of Wolfe, fatal because confined, is
            					admirably opposed to that of Algernon Mordaunt, whose patriotism takes the
            					ground-work of knowledge, and works hand in hand with philosophy and charity.
            					Mordaunt is one of those ideals of excellence which we respect an author for
            					conceiving. "The Disowned" also developed a new talent,
            					that of description: there are several landscapes as beautiful and as English
            as
            					those of our natural painter <a href="people.html#CollinsWpainter">Collins</a>. As an analysis of cause and effect, the history of Mr.
            					Talbot, the vain man, is a perfect specimen of moral dissection. His vanity is
            					the opposite of Lord Boradail's conceit. Vanity and conceit are often
            					confounded: nevertheless, they are very opposite qualities; as much difference
            					as there is between search and possession; vanity craves "golden
            					opinions" from all ranks of men; conceit sits down quietly in the enjoyment
            					of its own property. More poetical in its views, more elevated in its
            					philosophy, the remarks scattered through "The
            					Disowned," though less worldly, are not less true than those in its
            					predecessor. They take a higher, though not a less actual tone; and we doubt
            if
            					the sarcastic inference be a whit more accurate than the kindlier one. The
            					difference between their observations is, that in </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 442]</p><p class="pnoindent"> the one they are
            					taken in the spirit of satire; in the other, they are taken in that of
            					philosophy. If "Pelham," and the
            						"Disowned" were different,
            						"Devereux" was equally opposed to either. For
            					ourselves, we are free to confess that "Devereux" is
            					our favorite of all Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s works. It is at once an historical, a philosophical,
            					and a poetical novel. The historical scenes have that which is usually admitted
            					as the great merit of historical fiction, verisimilitude—if not exactly
            					what people did do, it was exactly what they might be supposed to have done:
            to
            					use a theatrical phrase, the illusion is well supported. But they have also
            					another great and peculiar merit, the lesson pointed for the apprehension of
            					even the most careless reader. Moral knowledge is the fine gold extracted from
            					the crucible of moral satire. The interview between the Czar and Devereux is
            an
            					admirable and forcible exposition of a great truth: we allude to the scene where
            					the influence of shame in punishment is illustrated by the difference between
            					the Russian and the German, while under the discipline of the knout.<span class="sup"><a href="#19" id="back19"><sup>19</sup></a> </span> The same remark may apply to the inimitable
            					scenes in Paris. The spirit of that age of epigrams was never so caught by an
            					English writer before. But we draw no false inferences: the dust is
            					diamond-dust, and it sparkles;—it is not thrown in our eyes. We see that
            					it was a time equally witty and worthless; and the same glance which takes in
            					its brilliancy also reveals its baseness. <a href="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Lord Bolingbroke</a>'s<span class="sup"><a href="#20" id="back20"><sup>20</sup></a> </span>
            					character is the most original feature in "Devereux."
            					Historical personages have often lent "the magic of a name" to the
            					fictitious page: but this is the first instance of historical research,
            					philosophical investigation, and the fellow-feeling of a noble mind being
            					devoted to embody, and to appreciate the merits of one to whom historians (we
            					will not say history) have shown scant mercy and less justice. The various
            					conversations in which <a href="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Bolingbroke</a> takes part, the just observations which throw such light
            					on his sentiments, the eloquent appreciation of his excellence, the clear
            					reasoning on his motives, are the perfection (if we may use such a phrase) of
            					dramatic biography. Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> himself says, "that to do justice to a great man is the
            					highest of literary pleasures;" and in this analysis of <a href="people.html#BolingbrokeHenryStJohn">Bolingbroke</a>, we know not
            					which most to admire, the truth of the defence, or the generous warmth of the
            					defender. The tomb of one great man is the altar of another. One very futile
            					objection against this noble impersonation has been urged by the Chinese of
            					criticism, or rather its Chancery barristers, who refer every thing to
            					precedent;—that, forsooth, "a novel is not the proper place for
            					political or historical discussion." Why, we would ask, is truth to be
            					debarred from taking its most effective, because most popular form? Such critics
            					are either strangely behind, or wilfully blind, to their own time, who deny the
            					importance of the novel. In works of imagination, a novel has been the
            					Aaron's rod<span class="sup"><a href="#21" id="back21"><sup>21</sup></a> </span> which has swallowed up the rest. If
            					a few great writers choose any one vehicle for their talent, hundreds of their
            					inferiors will choose the same mode, and follow in the track in which they never
            					could have led. We do firmly believe great popularity is </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 443]</p><p class="pnoindent"> never
            					gained without great desert. All will admit, that the first-rate talent of our
            					time has been developed in the novel. It is an error to say, that this is
            					because it is the most amusing; it is rather because it is the most appropriate.
            					Still, in literature, as in life, the sins of the fathers are visited upon the
            					children, even unto the third and fourth generation; and works, like <a href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>'s, which have done more
            					towards giving us real ideas of the days of yore, and drawn closer the links
            of
            					the past and present, than any chronicle ever written; or works like <a href="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</a>'s, and these of the
            					author now before us, full of the most important truths, are to receive for
            					their heritage the ill name of works in which, if the scene were laid in former
            					days, a dungeon, a beauty, white plumes and iron fetters, a little valour, and
            a
            					great deal of love, (love <span class="italics">à l'impossible en
               						passant</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#22" id="back22"><sup>22</sup></a> </span>) were all that could be required; or if of
            					modern life, the lover first raked, and then reformed; the heroine was first
            					miserable and then married. Such was the circulating cycle, and hence the novel
            					was held, nay, is still held by many, to be the Paria of literature. Truly may
            					it be said, that to change an opinion is difficult; but to remove a prejudice
            is
            					impossible. Before we resume our analysis, we cannot but remark on the singular
            					silence preserved towards the most rising author of their day, in the two
            					pseudo-called great Reviews, the <a href="people.html#EdinburghReview">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="people.html#QuarterlyReview">Quarterly</a>. The
            					former might have hesitated to censure in the very beginning, made wise by
            					experience: for nothing is more mortifying than your own prophecy unfulfilled;
            					and it is somewhat disagreeable to find the general judgment in direct
            					opposition to your criticism. We may suppose that <a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</a>, <a href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, <a href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuel">Coleridge</a>, &amp;c. have served as
            					landmarks. Every one of these names are now standard ones in our
            					"land's language;" and the Reviewer is remembered by his
            					injustice. <a href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Mr. Jeffrey</a> was the
            					Judge Jeffries of literature,<span class="sup"><a href="#23" id="back23"><sup>23</sup></a> </span>—a most partial and unjust judge. The
            					faculty of appreciation, that highest sign of a great mind, was wanting in his:
            					and, take the range of our first-rate authors, they are all instances of public
            					opinion reversing the verdict which proceeded from his tribunal. As for the <a href="people.html#QuarterlyReview">Quarterly</a>, we all know it is too
            					well trained, to wander beyond the districts of <span class="italics">Moravia</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#24" id="back24"><sup>24</sup></a> </span> It has not room, forsooth, for
            					works that are in every one's hands, whose thoughts and whose feelings are

            					Emperor of Constantinople,<span class="sup"><a href="#25" id="back25"><sup>25</sup></a> </span> whose name it bears; or a volume of travels, whose
            					young writer carefully records the slender ankles and dark eyes of every Spanish

            					issue from Albermarle-street, and the <a href="people.html#QuarterlyReview">Quarterly</a> at once finds room for analysis and adulation. The truth
            					is, that we have no great literary review, each being engrossed in politics,
            					busy deciding whether <a href="people.html#SadlerMichaelThomas">Sadler</a>

            					of opinion: but more of this when we come to "Paul
            					Clifford."
         </p>
         <p> To return to "Devereux." The character of the hero
            					seems to us to be one of Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s most powerful and original conceptions: the influence
            					of circumstances upon nature is finely and profoundly traced.
            						"Devereux is imaginative, affectionate, passionate by
            					nature; worldly, cold, and guarded in his crust of circumstance. The poetry
            					inherent, and the philosophy acquired, are exquisitely developed. We never could
            					read the account of his boyhood without the most intense interest,—the
            					warm love of the child thrown back upon itself by unkind coldness and unjust
            					preference. We shall only say, fortunate are those who do not sympathize with
            					the affectionate, yet unloved boy, whose heart becomes sullen as sadness always
            					does when utterly unshared. There is terrible injustice in the treatment of
            					children: how arbitrary is the authority exercised over them! How much does the
            					anger or the fondness lavished upon them depend on the temper of the moment!
            					What a contradiction between the much we expect them to acquire, and the little
            					we expect them to observe! At one time they are to learn all that demands
            					comprehension and industry,—(think how much pure abstract knowledge a
            					child is expected to master;) and then, at another period, they are treated like
            					a machine, that neither sees nor hears; or, at least, seeing and hearing as one
            					who understandeth not; saving that memory is a most faithless faculty, a mirror
            					in which a man looks, and "straightway forgetteth what manner of man he
            					is," or was. Our own experience might teach us a different lesson. But
            					preference, and its consequence, neglect, is the child's most cruel wrong.
            					The bitter feeling of comparing our own lot with another's, will come quite
            					soon enough without its being taught in infancy. Early injustice is like the
            					thread of silk planted with the tulip—it colours all the after leaves. Its
            					influence runs through all Devereux's future character; the warm emotions
            					concealed—the affectionate temper checked—restraint deepening into
            					reserve, and self-dependance hardening into self-reliance, are all traced with
            					the accuracy of an anatomist, and with a beauty even beyond their truth. The
            					awakening of all his better nature under the affection of his uncle, and that
            					kind old uncle himself, are transcripts from one of the very best and dearest
            					pages of human life. As for Sir William, we do not insist upon every reader
            					liking him as much as we do ourselves; but we must own, if they do not, we shall
            					have a very bad opinion of them. It is curious to mark the likeness of position
            					and the dissimilarity of character between Pelham and Devereux: both are young,
            					noble, panting, first, for pleasure, next for worldly distinction; and both are
            					fops, "mandarins of the first class;"<span class="sup"><a href="#27" id="back27"><sup>27</sup></a> </span> but still how
            					different. Pelham's worldliness is the philosophy of his calm, calculating,
            					yet high nature: that of Devereux, on the contrary, is a disguise and a
            					security. The coxcombry of Pelham is like a cast from his features; that of
            					Devereux is a mask to his face. The difference is imagination in the one, the
            					want of it in the other. This is especially shown in their love: —love,
            					which if but an episode in the active life of man, is a lasting influence in
            his
            					ideal one. We do not think the most susceptible </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 445]</p><p class="pnoindent"> reader is very
            					unquiet about the success of Pelham's suit: we think the very coldest must
            					be touched by Devereux's generous and devoted attachment to the beautiful
            					and desolate Spanish girl. Love was never more passionate in <a href="people.html#ByronGeorge">Byron</a>, more true in <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakspeare</a>, more lovely in
            					nature, than it is here "gently bodied forth." We have hitherto dwelt
            					on other merits than the rich passionate colours given by the heart. But the
            					whole history of Isora is touched by that poetical spirit, which does not, it
            is
            					true, make nature more beautiful than nature often is, but shows that beauty
            in
            					its fairest light, the light of imagination. There is, to us, something
            					inexpressibly touching in Devereux's abiding affection, when, to quote an
            					exquisite passage from the " Milton" in after-years,<span class="sup"><a href="#28" id="back28"><sup>28</sup></a> </span> "her
            					memory made the moonlight of his mind," and </p>

         <p>One great peculiarity in Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s writings is, the singular originality of his minor
            					characters: they are not merely "two or three puppets to fill up the
            					scene," whose only distinguishing mark is a name, but each is some embodied
            					thought, and distinguished by some natural touch: in short, people in his books
            					are as different as they are in real life. Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> combines, to a rare
            					degree, the power of creation with the faculty of observation; and it is this
            					union which gives such infinite variety to "his storied page of human
            						life."<span class="sup"><a href="#30" id="back30"><sup>30</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> "Paul Clifford" came next; as different to its brethren
            					as if they had not had "one common father." 
         </p>
         <p> "Paul Clifford" is at once a political satire, a
            					romance of middle life; a practical and moral treatise, put forth in the popular
            					form of a novel. The satire is levelled at existing persons and abuses—the
            					romance is the poetry which passion and feeling extract from the daily events
            of
            					common life—the moral is that drawn from the temptation which leads, and
            					the punishment which follows, the crimes we know to be hourly committed. For
            the
            					first time, Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> seems
            					to have felt what an engine of power was the novel for present utility; how
            					forcibly it could be brought to play on the vice whose result is
            					misery—the indolence whose result is injury, and the selfishness which is
            					at once its own best and worst punishment. What leading-article in a review ever
            					brought forward the evil influence of laws, that punish rather than guard, upon
            					the lower classes, with such energy and truth as the dramatic exposition of
            					their hardship and insufficiency in "Paul Clifford?" It
            					is a great and noble distinction for an author (and we know no other modern
            					novelist that can "lay the flattering unction to his soul"<span class="sup"><a href="#31" id="back31"><sup>31</sup></a> </span>) to be able to say, "I have written
            					in the hope of </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 446]</p><p class="pnoindent"> pointing attention to great abuses—to awful
            					suffering. The feelings, the weaknesses, the wretchedness of a great body of
            my
            					countrymen have been utterly neglected; to their benefit I dedicate my

            					people." As a matter of taste, we have owned to liking
            						"Devereux" the best; but as matter of principle, we
            					give the preference to " Paul Clifford." The use of the

         <p> Whether in lively satire, keen remark, or accurate reflection—whether in
            					deducing the character from circumstance—whether in painting the nice
            					distinction of natural good feeling which favourable position ripens into
            					virtue, or natural strong passion, or weakness, which events harden into
            					crime—the desire of benefit from an obvious lesson, or practical inference
            					necessarily drawn by the reader, the same desire of conferring a moral benefit
            					on the author's kind is paramount through all. Fiction is the eloquence of
            					experience, and to be useful it must be actual. The character of William
            						Brandon<span class="sup"><a href="#32" id="back32"><sup>32</sup></a> </span>
            					is as yet our author's most powerful conception. The lava-flood of passion,
            					which bursts in one red flood, chills, hardens—never to melt
            					again—the evil knowledge brought by too early experience (for experience
            					may come too soon—the fruit must be mature that the east wind will not
            					injure); the bitter consciousness of surpassing talent, unused and
            					useless—the pride, which though inherent in the nature, has no outward
            					cause of display, and takes refuge and fights under the shield of
            					scorn—passion, talent, and knowledge—these best gifts of our kind,
            					and yet those that may be turned to the worst purpose—never were these
            					more finely developed than in William Brandon. One single touch of human
            					kindliness in this proud and cold man is in his gentle and fatherly love for
            					Lucy, his orphan niece. It may seem fanciful, but it has always reminded us of
            					the tuft of blue violets <a href="people.html#FraserJamesBaillie">Frazer</a> records with such expression of pleasure, when he finds them
            					growing, lonely and lovely, on the high and icy mountains of Himala.<span class="sup"><a href="#33" id="back33"><sup>33</sup></a> </span> Lord Mauliverer is an inimitable satire on
            					aristocratic indulgence; he is the <span class="italics">far niente</span><span class="sup"><a href="#34" id="back34"><sup>34</sup></a> </span> of indolent luxury embodied in all its selfishness. One
            					single expression sets forth his whole system of action. Brandon, at a <span class="italics">tête-à-tête</span> dinner, refuses or
            					neglects some dainty of the table, and Mauliverer exclaims, "Oh, hang your
            					abstemiousness, it is d——d unfriendly to eat so little!" This
            					slight speech is the essence of one who desires companionship for its
            					pleasantness, and not for its sympathy. Lucy Brandon, the heroine, is an entire
            					contrast to all Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s former female portraits. Isabel and Isora<span class="sup"><a href="#35" id="back35"><sup>35</sup></a> </span> were
            					high-wrought, beautiful, and ideal—as if poetry had lent its aid to life,
            					to show "how divine a thing a woman might be made;" but Lucy is a
            					sweet, simple, gentle creature—entirely a girl—only a very lovely
            					and loveable one, till circumstances discover that gold lies beneath the stream
            					which had hitherto only "broke into dimples and laughed in the sun."
            					It is the "unconquerable strength of love," giving its own force to a
            					nature essentially timid and feminine. One of the great merits of this work is
            					the many slight touches, which, like the finishings of a portrait, give such
            					identity to a picture. The descriptions are singularly accurate, from that of
            					the small and most wretched streets in London on a wet night, to the ancient
            					manor-house with its one old chestnut tree "worth a forest." The
            					affections delineated are such as are in constant play, brightening and
            					sweetening from the lofti- </p>

            					colouring of passion is terrible from its truth. The scattered observations are
            					as valuable for their justice as they are remarkable for their acuteness. Take
            					the following admirable remark for an instance;—"Showy theories are
            					always more seductive to the young and clever than suasive examples, and the
            					vanity of the youthful makes them better pleased by being convinced of a thing

            						first."<span class="sup"><a href="#37" id="back37"><sup>37</sup></a> </span> We are reforming all
            					abuses so much, that, perhaps, in a few years, the redoubtable Peter will be
            an
            					historical memento of a base and cowardly school of criticism, which may then
            					have left "but the name" "of its faults and its sorrows
            					behind." The personal attacks; the virulent sneers; the coarse and false
            					statements; the foolish opinions of a set whose incognito is indeed their
            					existence—for who would or could care for the abuse of an individual whose
            					own character was below contempt, or who would not despite the judgment of one
            					whose only right to pronounce such judgment lay in his own previous failure in
            					some similar attempt to that which he denounces? Who shall deny that the great
            					body of critics are made up of unsuccessful writers?—the inferior
            					magazines and journals are truly the refuge for the literary destitute. Men who
            					are anonymous are usually abusive, and want of principle and want of
            					responsibility are only too synonymous. Nothing can be perfect in this world,
            					but two rules would greatly conduce to the perfectability of
            					criticism:—the first to speak, not of the author, but of his works; his
            					pages, not himself, are amenable to your remarks: secondly, to do away with the
            					present anonymous system; this would have a double advantage; it would force
            the
            					critic to be just, if not generous, for his own sake—for men weigh
            					opinions for which they are to be instantly answereable; and also, when the
            					critic is known, the public would be able to judge, from previous knowledge of
            					what he had himself done, how far he was competent to decide on the labours of
            					others; but our present literary bush-fighting is as deteriorating as it is
            					disgraceful. There are some excellent remarks, and written in the best spirit
            of
            					criticism, in the dedicatory epistle to "Paul

            					the temptations to which poverty is subjected in real and social life—such
            					a hero is Paul Clifford. Critics, like copy-books, are ruled by

            						"Milton" is a noble poem, "a worthy offering

            					fine remark on <a href="people.html#ChanningWilliamEllery">Channing</a>'s Essay on <a href="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</a>: it says—"The spirit of <a href="people.html#MiltonJohn">Milton</a> was upon him, and possessed
            					him; and he writes as one constrained to do so by thoughts too fervid, intense,
            					and expansive to be restrained. He speaks as a priest, under the immediate
            					influence of the god at whose altar he was ministering—so should genius be
            						honoured!"<span class="sup"><a href="#43" id="back43"><sup>43</sup></a> </span> We can have
            					nothing to say that will better apply to this poem. We have heard the term
            					satire objected to, as applied to "The Siamese Twins;"
            					we confess it does not belong to the Sunday-newspaper school of satirists, in
            					which real names and nicknames, personality and brutality constitute what is
            					called a powerful article; but if abuse is not the whole of wit, to
            					wit—the keen and the ready—this poem may well lay claim. If Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> wants any thing, it is
            					that innate gaiety, which in a writer, like good spirits in a companion, carries
            					us along with it. Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>'s serious satire is more apparent than his more playful vein,
            					simply because the one has, and the other has not, the impress of his own mind.
            					Nothing, especially in poetry, divides opinion more than great originality;
            					readers are at fault when no good old rule is at hand to serve as a
            					guage—and when at a loss, it is always safest to condemn. To be the first
            					to praise requires more self-reliance than the generality of people possess,
            and

         <p> We have now, as far as our power extends, done our duty (for what is justice but
            					a duty?) to this extraordinary writer. If we have cordially expressed our
            					admiration, it is because we have cordially felt it. We have neither attempted
            					to detail the stories nor describe the characters; the meagre sketch of a tale,
            					or the bare outline of a character, is as a skeleton, which requires to be
            					clothed in flesh before it can rise up in grace or beauty. We have endeavoured
            					to give our own strong impression—to select some of the most detachable
            					merits, and then to say to our readers, judge for yourselves on the right of
            our
            					opinion, bearing in mind that we can set forth only a very small part of sixteen
            					volumes, full of all the various developement of mind and feeling.

         <p> A transition from the author's works to the author's self has been a
            					common consequence of fame in all ages. Though we do not quite go the length

            					native city, deems it worthy of mention that <a href="people.html#RousseauJeanJacques">Jean Jacques</a> wore a cap
            					trimmed with fur, but that he would not decide whether it was lined with fur
            or
            					not, for he never took it off: still, by that rule which leads us to judge of
            					others' feelings by our own, we think the curiosity, personal though it be,
            					about a distinguished author, is, to say the least, very excusable. We often
            					hear complaints that the author does not sustain the <span class="italics">beau ideal</span> of his hero; this complaint, at least, cannot be made of
            					Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a>. His appearance is
            					distinguished, his features chiselled and regular, and the whole expression of
            					his face highly intellectual as well as handsome. Generally, though we confess
            					to having but a slight personal knowledge, Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> is silent and reserved
            					in society; but this may in some measure arise from his extreme distaste to
            					mixing with it: for at times nothing can exceed the flashing wit of his gayer
            					converse, unless it be the originality and interest of his more serious
            					discourse. Mr. <a href="people.html#BulwerEdwardLytton">Bulwer</a> is
