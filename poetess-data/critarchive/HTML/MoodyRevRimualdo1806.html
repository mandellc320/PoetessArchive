         <header class="headBibl">Art. 25. <span class="italics">Rimualdo;</span> or, The Castle of Badajos. A Romance. By <a href="people.html#IrelandWH">W. H. Ireland</a>. <span class="smcaps">12</span>mo. 4 Vols. 14s. Boards. Longman and
            							Rees. 1800.<span class="sup"><a href="#1" id="back1"><sup>1</sup></a> </span></header>
         <p>The title of romance still invigorates our spirits. Old as we are, it recalls to
            					our recollection the stories in which our youth delighted, of wandering knights,
            					tilts, tournaments, enchanted castles, formidable giants, sea monsters,
            					distressed damsels, tremendous fights, and impossible valour. We forget,
            					however, that "the days of chivalry are gone;" and that, in the <span class="italics">present-day romance</span>, we must expect little other
            					amusement than the oglio of the modern novel supplies: consisting of unnatural
            					parents,—persecuted lovers,—murders,—haunted
            					apartments,—winding sheets, and winding stair-cases,—subterraneous
            					passages,—lamps that are dim and perverse, and that always go out when
            					they should not,—monasteries,—caves,—monks, tall, thin, and
            					withered, with lank abstemious cheeks,—dreams,—groans,—and
            					spectres.
         </p>
         <p> Such is the outline of the <span class="italics">modern</span> romance; and
            						<a href="people.html#IrelandWH">Mr. Ireland</a>'s copy is not
            					unworthy of its numerous prototypes. We have here, in the personages of the
            					drama, a parent and a husband in the Marquis of Badajos, as wicked and as
            					unnatural as any with whom we have before had the honor of being
            					acquainted.—We have a son in the Condé Rimualdo, as eminent for
            					filial piety as Æneas himself.—We have patient suffering innocence in
            					the fair Constanza, equalling, if not transcending any of our novel
            					heroines.—We have <span class="italics">very good</span> haunted
            					towers,—and a <span class="italics">spectre</span> that stands supremely
            					eminent over the whole race of ghosts.—Hamlets and Banquos were no more
            					than <span class="italics">mawkins</span> in a cherry-tree, compared with that
            					terrific vision which Rimualdo encounters on entering the old ruined chapel in
            					the forest.—Though familiarized very much, lately, to these apparitions,
            					we did not feel inclined to go to bed, till we had puffed away the recollection
            					of this spectre in a whiff of tobacco, and re-animated our fleeting spirits by
            a
            					double draught of old October: which will not be matter of surprise to the
            					reader, when he learns that the hero himself, the brave Rimualdo, dropped down
            					in a swoon immediately on seeing it! 
         </p>
         <p> Murder is in this romance too much <span class="italics">the order of the
               						day</span>. We have murders in castles, in forests, and in cottages; and, to
            					borrow a word from the author, we are too frequently <span class="italics">enhorrored.—Raw head and bloody bones</span> is continually at our
            					heels, through a long journey of 926 pages; and we were therefore happy to get
            					rid of him, and to leave our terrified fellow-travellers calmly settled in the
            					unhaunted Castilio di Montalvan. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#IrelandWH">Mr. Ireland</a>'s language is
            					animated and flowing, when it is <span class="italics">not inflated</span> with
            					pomposity. The Escurial (for the scene of action is in Spain) is well and
            					minutely described; and the Castle of Badajos is a pleasing picture: but, like
            					some sister <span class="italics">Novelists</span>, he deals too profusely in
            					poetic description, and the common operations of Nature are never detailed in
            					common language. Morning never appears without 'Aurora's tints that
            					crown the summits of the distant mountains.'—The sun never rises but
            					'as the imperial charioteer of day, hast'ning his car of blazing light
            					towards green ocean's occidental flood-gate.' </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 204]</p><p class="pnoindent">The moon is always full
            					orb'd, yet never looks <span class="italics">full</span> at us, but peeps
            					behind fleecy clouds.—Night never forgets to assume the appropriate
            					dignity of her sable mantle, with which (when she is not in a good humour)
            					'she overspreads heaven's countless luminaries;' —and if
            					the hero and heroine are in a storm, God alone can help them,—for then
            					'impetuous winds blow from <span class="italics">every direction</span>
            						(<span class="italics">all at once</span>), flakey lightning emblazons
            					night's ebon robe, and full charged clouds <span class="italics">discharge</span> tremendous explosions.' 
         </p>
         <p> Thus is poetic imagery blended with prose detail; producing a medley of
            					heterogeneous language totally destructive of good writing, by violating those
            					principles of harmonious congruity which form the basis of a correct and
            					uncontaminated diction.
