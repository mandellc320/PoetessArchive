            church, in his infancy; and his mother, upon that event, removed with him to
            Glasgow. He was educated for the medical profession, and, after attending the
            University lectures, was received, at the early age of seventeen, as
            surgeon's mate in the allied army in Flanders, then commanded by the <a href="people.html#CumberlandWilliam">Duke of Cumberland</a>. He returned
            to England on the peace which took place the year after, and, after passing some
            time in London, visited Paris in the course of professional improvement.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span>Here he spent two years in attendance on the lectures and hospitals; and
            was at the same time patronized by the <a href="people.html#AlbemarleGeorgeKeppel">Duke of Albemarle</a>, the

            spending some more time in London, settled at Glasgow. Here he continued to
            practise for a few years with that gentleman, and afterwards alone, till he was
            forty, when an incident gave a totally new direction to the rest of his
            life.â€”This was his introduction to the Hamilton family, by his attendance
            on the duke (<a href="people.html#HamiltonJamesGeorge">George</a>), a
            youth of fifteen, then labouring under a consumptive disorder, for which he was
            ordered to the continent, where he died. <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr.
               Moore</a> (for about this time he obtained the diploma of Doctor of physic
            from Glasgow) was, soon after this event, engaged by the <a href="people.html#CampbellElizabeth">Duchess of Hamilton and Argyle</a>
            to accompany her son, the late <a href="people.html#HamiltonDouglas">Duke of
               Hamilton</a>, who was also of a delicate constitution, in an extensive
            tour on the continent, in which they spent five years. After his return, he
            removed with his family to London. 
         </p>
         <p> Such a tour, in the maturity of life, and with <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a>'s genius, added to the
            early opportunities he had enjoyed of acquaintance with the language and manners
            of foreign countries, might be supposed to afford ample materials for
            entertaining and informing the public; and accordingly the fruits of his travels
            soon appeared in two volumes, entitled <span class="italics">A View of
               Society and Manners in France, Switzerland, and Germany</span>.
            These were published in 1779, and were succeeded by <span class="italics">A View of Society and Manners in
               Italy</span>, in two volumes, published 1787. These travels have been very
            generally read, and contain both information and entertainment. Their author was
            at once an acute and a good-natured observer of men and man- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> ners,
            and was too much familiarized with foreign countries to exhibit the churlish
            prejudices which the mere Englishman is apt to display on his first crossing the
            Channel. In both these tours, entertainment has been one principal object with
            the author, and the result of his observations on manners and character is often
            made more lively by being mixed with anecdote, and thrown into the dramatic form
            of dialogue. From delineations of this kind, the transition was easy to
            delineating character and manners under the form of a novel; and his <span class="italics">Zeluco</span>, which appeared in 1789, placed
            its author in the first rank of writers of that class. <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a>'s next publication was
            occasioned by a visit he made to Paris with <a href="people.html#LauderdaleJamesMaitland">Lord Lauderdale</a> during
            the early scenes of the French revolution. It was entitled <span class="italics">A Journal during a Residence in France, from the
               Beginning of August to the Middle of December</span>, 1792; to
            which is added, <span class="italics">An Account of the most
               remarkable Events that happened at Paris, from that Time to the Death of
               <a href="people.html#LouisXVIKingofFrance">the late King of
                  France</a></span>. 2 vols. These are written with more
            discernment and impartiality than most publications of the time, but the
            crowding events of subsequent periods have thrown them out of date.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p><a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a>'s frequent and
            successful publications caused his name to be ranked rather among authors than
            among professional men; and though greatly esteemed by his friends, it does not
            appear that he was ever in full practice after he removed to London. Amongst his
            various writings, however, his own profession was not forgotten. He published in
            1786 a volume entitled <span class="italics">Medical</span></p>

            his subject rather in a popular than a scientific manner, and not without a
            mixture, in his usual vein, of anecdotes and humorous sarcasm. He also
            introduced a dissertation on consumption where one would scarcely have looked
            for it, in his <span class="italics">View of Manners in
               Italy</span>. The favourable manner in which <span class="italics">Zeluco</span> had been received, induced its
            author to give to the world two other novels, <span class="italics">Edward</span>, published in 1796, and <span class="italics">Mordaunt</span> in 1800: the latter was the
            offspring of his declining years.

         <p><a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a> died in 1803 at Richmond,<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> where he had spent in retirement the last years of his
            life, delighting himself with the opening prospects of his rising family, five
            sons and a daughter. He lived long enough to pride himself in the growing
            reputation and brilliant career of one of these sons; but, happily for himself,
            not long enough to witness the disappointment of his fondest hopes, in the
            premature death of this gallant and unfortunate hero.<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span><a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a> enjoyed the esteem of a
            numerous circle of acquaintance, by whom his social and companionable qualities
            will long be remembered. His person was large, his eye-brows remarkably thick,
            his countenance was well calculated to add expression to that shrewdness of
            remark and that peculiar dry humour with which his conversation as well as his
            writings was plentifully seasoned. 
         </p>
         <p> The novel of <span class="italics">Zeluco</span>, which appears
            in this selection, is one of the most entertaining we possess, from the real
            knowledge of the world which it displays, and the humour and spirit of the
            dialogue. It also excites no small degree of </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page v]</p><p class="pnoindent">interest. The scene is
            laid in Italy, and the familiarity of the author with foreign manners enabled
            him to diversify his productions with descriptions and characters beyond the
            range of our own domestic society. This work is formed on the singular plan of
            presenting a hero of the story, if hero he may be called, who is a finished
            model of depravity. Zeluco is painted as radically vicious, without the
            intermixture of any one good quality; but, if the perfectly virtuous character
            is to be considered, for so we are sometimes told, as out of nature, "a
            faultless monster whom the world ne'er saw,"<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> it is to be hoped a perfectly vicious character is at least as
            extraordinary a production. There is no degree of atrocity to which human nature
            may not arrive from time and circumstances; want and misery harden the heart as
            well as the features: but it is scarcely conceivable that a youth coming into
            life with every advantage of fortune and person and abilities, should never feel
            his heart expand, amongst his youthful companions, into some kindly feeling,
            bearing at least the semblance of benevolence. The whole character has a darker
            tinge of villainy than is usually found in this country: it is drawn with great
            strength, and proceeds in a regular progress of depravity, from his squeezing
            the sparrow to death when a child, to the incident of the deadly grasp which he
            gives his own child; a circumstance of horror new and truly tragical. It
            reaches, like the character of Satan, the sublime of guilt. The attachment
            between the wife and her lover is managed with great delicacy; yet if she
            preserves </p>

            far it is favourable to good morals to interest the reader in a passion for a
            married woman, however unhappily she may be yoked. The character of Signora
            Sporza is drawn with spirit; it is quite a foreign one. The conversation-pieces
            abound in humour, and show that intimate knowledge of real life and characters
            which mere sentimental novels are generally deficient in. The quarrel between
            the two Scotchmen about the character of their queen Mary is infinitely amusing,
            and while it touches the national character and national partialities with the
            hand of a friend, it at the same time exhibits them in a light truly comic.
            Father Mulo is amusing; and there is a good deal of light humour in the story of
            Rosolia, or rather in the manner of telling it. Much knowledge of the world and
            good sense are exhibited in the dialogues between the hot-headed young
            protestant divine and the colonel, whose wife he insists upon converting: the
            death-bed of the latter is affecting, and exhibits views of piety, if not vivid,
            at least calm and rational. It must by no means be forgotten that, to the honour
            of the author, there is a great deal of forcible reasoning against the
            slave-trade; and there is no stroke in <a href="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</a> of a finer pathos than the answer of the dying Hanno, when he
            was told that his cruel master would broil in hell to all eternityâ€”"I

         <p><span class="italics">Edward</span>, the author's next
            publication of the kind, is much inferior to <span class="italics">Zeluco</span>: the best character in it is that of Barton the epicure, who is
            indifferent to every thing but a good table, and marries his wife for her skill
            in preparing a dish of stewed carp. It has also many amusing
            conversation-pieces. <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a> tells a
            story well, but it must be allowed he makes the most of it. He has not spared
            his own profession, but has some lively strictures on the incapacity and <span class="italics">charlatanerie</span><span class="sup"><a href="#13" id="back13"><sup>13</sup></a> </span> of pretenders in it. He drew with a free pen; and from his acquaintance
            with life, and facility in dialogue, it seems probable that he would have
            succeeded in comedy, if he had turned his thoughts that way. <span class="italics">Mordaunt</span>, written a little before <a href="people.html#MooreJohn">Dr. Moore</a>'s death, is a very
            languid production; both his novels subsequent to <span class="italics">Zeluco</span> are not only inferior in
            entertainment to his first work, but, what was less to be expected, inferior in
            morality.
