         <p class=""><a href="people.html#LennoxCharlotte"><span class="largest">M</span><span class="smcaps">rs. Lennox</span></a>, a very respectable writer,
            was born at New York. She was a diligent and successful author. She performed a
            useful service to English literature by translating <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#DukeofSully">Sully</a>'s Memoirs</span>, as also <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#BrumoyPierre">Brumoy</a>'s Greek Theatre</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> She likewise gave to the world <span class="italics">Shakespear Illustrated</span>, in three
            volumes; being a collection of the tales and histories upon which the plays of
            <a href="people.html#ShakespeareWilliam">Shakespear</a> are founded.
            Her original works are some comedies, and a number of novels, of which latter
            <span class="italics">The Female Quixote</span> and
            <span class="italics">Henrietta</span> are esteemed the
            best. Her exertions did not place her in easy circumstances, for she died poor
            in 1804. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">The Female Quixote</span>, published in
            1752, is an agreeable and ingenious satire upon the old romances; not the more
            ancient ones of chivalry, but the languishing love romances of the <a href="people.html#LaCalprenede">Calprenéde</a>s and <a href="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Scuderi</a>s. Arabella, the heroine,
            is supposed to have been brought up in the country, and secluded, during the
            life of her father, from all society, but allowed to amuse herself in an old
            library furnished with the works of those voluminous authors. Of course she </p>

            out into the world, possessed of beauty and fortune, but with a profound
            ignorance of every circumstance of real life and manners. She fancies every man
            who speaks to her to be secretly in love with her, and is in continual
            apprehensions of being forcibly carried off. The gardener she imagines to be a
            prince in disguise, and is extremely shocked when her supposed lover is turned
            away for stealing carp. Meantime she is beloved by her cousin, an amiable young
            gentleman and every way suitable to her; nor has she any dislike to her admirer,
            but that she finds him very deficient in the code of gallantry prescribed by her
            favourite authors. She insists upon his reading some of them; but not having
            brought to the task a sufficient degree of attention, he gets into disgrace with
            her by not knowing that Orontes and Orondates are the same person; which betrays
            that he has not read as far as she had enjoined him. Many other incidents have a
            good deal of humour. Arabella, for instance, calls a lady's waiting-maid
            into her closet, and gravely desires her to relate, according to immemorial
            custom, the <span class="italics">adventures</span> of her lady. The surprise
            of the waiting-maid is extreme; the more, as her lady happens to have had some
            adventures of a nature she would not wish to be talked of. 
         </p>
         <p> The falsification of history in these romances, which was the fault <a href="people.html#Boileau">Boileau</a> chiefly exposed in his satire, is
            agreeably ridiculed by the incident of a conversation which passes between the
            heroine and a gentleman who is introduced to her </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">as one who
            possesses a great knowledge of history and of the ancients, and whom she
            strangely perplexes by questions and anecdotes of Cyrus, and Cletia, and
            Horatius Cocles,<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> which he cannot explain or answer by any information
            his reading has furnished him with. The young lady's cousin is represented
            as more patient of her extravagancies than most modern lovers would be; but she
            is painted as amiable, and, like <a href="people.html#DonQuixote">Don
               Quixote</a>, rational in every respect where her particular whim is not
            touched.
         </p>
         <p> The work is rather spun out too much, and not very well wound up. The grave
            moralizing of a clergyman is not the means by which the heroine should have been
            cured of her reveries. She should have been recovered by the sense of ridicule;
            by falling into some absurd mistake, or by finding herself on the brink of
            becoming the prey of some romantic footman, like the ladies in <a href="people.html#Moliere">Moliere</a>'s piece of <span class="italics">Les Précieuses Ridicules</span>, the
            ridicule of which has pretty much the same bearing.
         </p>
         <p> The performance of <a href="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</a>
            is the best of the various <span class="italics">Quixotes</span> which have
            been written in imitation of the immortal <a href="people.html#Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, and forms a fair counterpart to it, as it presents a
            similar extravagance, yet drawn from a later class of authors, and more adapted
            to female reading. It has also one disadvantage in common with that work,
            namely, that the satire has now no object. Most young ladies of the present day,
            instead of requiring to be cured of reading those bulky romances, would acquire
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iv]</p><p class="pnoindent">the first information of their manner from the work designed to
            ridicule them. 
         </p>
         <p> It is observable that <a href="people.html#DrydenJohn">Dryden</a>, as <a href="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</a> asserts, has borrowed
            characters and incidents in his plays from these works. No doubt there were many
            things in them to admire; nor is it very improbable that, in the rage for
            reviving every thing that is old, they may make their appearance again in a
            modern quarto of hot-pressed paper, with a life and an engraving from the
            original portrait of <a href="people.html#ScuderyMadeleine">Mad<span class="sup">lle</span> Scudery</a> by <a href="people.html#NanteuilRobert">Nanteuil</a>, with her elegant verses
            under it.
         </p>
         <p> The style of <a href="people.html#LennoxCharlotte">Mrs. Lennox</a> is
            easy, but it does not rise to the elegance attained by many more modern female
            writers.
         </p>
         <p> Her <span class="italics">Henrietta</span> is not without merit.
            It begins with the incident of two young ladies who are perfect strangers to
            each other, meeting in a stage-coach, when, after a few minutes conversation,
            one of them exclaims, "Let us swear an eternal friendship,"—the
            sentiment and the very words brought forward to ridicule the modern German
            plays, in the well-known humorous parody of them in <a href="people.html#AntiJacobin">The Anti-Jacobin</a>!<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span></p>
