         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">W</span>ITH the readers of
            sentimental novels, those of <a href="people.html#MackenzieHenry">Mr.
               Mackenzie</a> have been great favourites. They exhibit real powers of
            pathos, though the judicious reader will probably be of opinion that at the time
            they were published they were somewhat overrated. They imitate the manner of
            <a href="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</a>, who was then much in
            fashion, and whose light and delicate touches of nature had made so strong an
            impression that it raised a kind of school of writers in that walk. 
         </p>
         <p>The very title of <span class="italics">The Man of Feeling</span>
            sufficiently indicates that the writer means to take strong aim at the heart of
            the reader. It is difficult, however, to form a clear and consistent idea of the
            character of the hero of the piece. The author has given him extreme
            sensibility, but of that timid and melancholy cast which nearly incapacitates a
            man for the duties of life and the energies of action. The general impression
            upon the reader is that of a man "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
            thought,"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> languid and delicate; yet he is also supposed to be
            animated by that ardent and impetuous enthusiasm which acts by sudden and
            irresistible impulses, </p>

            that of <a href="people.html#CumberlandRichard">Mr. Cumberland</a>'s
            <span class="italics">West-Indian</span>. 
         </p>
         <p>When Harley is about to relieve the prostitute, to whom, by the way, he had given
            half-a-guinea the night before, and who could not therefore be in any immediate
            danger of perishing, he was in such a hurry that, "though two vibrations of
            a pendulum would have served him to lock his bureau, they could not be
            spared." Yet with these lively and ungovernable feelings, this man of
            sensibility, being deeply in love with a young lady, who seems all along to have
            had a very tender partiality for him, allows himself to languish and pine away
            without declaring his passion; and at length dies, whether of love or of a
            consumption is not very clear, without having made any effort to obtain her
            hand. We are not more active in serving others than in serving ourselves: such a
            one might be "a man of feeling," but his benevolence would be confined
            to mere sensations. Yet the last chapter, entitled, <span class="italics">The Man of Feeling made happy</span>, the
            reader will find, at least if he happen to be in a tender mood, pathetic.
            Harley, in the last stage of weakness, has an interview with his mistress, in
            which he receives an avowal of her regard for him, and then dies contented.

         <p>But by far the most interesting part of this novel is the story of Edwards,
            particularly the scene where he is taken by the press-gang. It would be a good
            subject for the painter. It deserves the pencil of Mr. <a href="people.html#WilkieDavid">Wilkie</a>. The whole harmless family are
            represented in high glee,</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent">playing at blind-man's buff; young
            Edwards, with his eyes covered, is trying to guess which of them he has caught,
            when the ruffian's voice bursts upon him like thunder, and overwhelms them
            all with despair. Yet, in endeavouring to draw as many tears as he can from his
            readers, an author of this class is apt to represent the virtuous and
            industrious in low life as continually exposed to oppression and injustice, and
            it is hardly to be wished that even our virtuous feelings should be awakened at
            the expense of truth. There is no connected story in this work, except that of
            Edwards. The thread of the history is supposed to be broken by the imperfection
            of the manuscript. A convenient supposition.

         <p><span class="italics">Julia de Roubign√©</span> is in the
            same cast of tender sorrow, but has the advantage of a connected story, which,
            though simple, has much effect. The scenes of domestic life, and the affections
            which belong to them, are in many places beautifully touched; but an uniform hue
            of sadness pervades the whole. The sentiments are all pure, and the style
            exhibits fewer marks of imitation than the former work. It is in general
            elegant, though here and there a negligent expression occurs, as, "he was
            abed," for "he was in bed," "he used to joke me." Upon
            the whole, though these two novels have obtained great celebrity, at least their
            day, they still fall short of the exquisitely beautiful story of <span class="italics">La Roche</span>, by the same author,
            published in <span class="italics">The Mirror</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span></p>
