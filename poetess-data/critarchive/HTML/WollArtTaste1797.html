         <p><span class="smcaps">sir</span>, 
         </p>
         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">A</span> TASTE for rural scenes, in the present state of
            society, appears to me to be very often an artificial sentiment, rather inspired
            by poetry and romances, than a real perception of the beauties of nature; but,
            as it is reckoned a proof of refined taste to praise the calm pleasure which the
            country affords, the theme is exhausted; yet, it may be made a question, whether
            this romantic kind of declamation has much effect on the conduct of those who
            leave, for a season, the crowded cities in which they were bred. 
         </p>
         <p> I have been led into these reflections by observing, when I have resided for any
            length of time in the country, how few people seem to contemplate nature with
            their own eyes. I have “brushed the dew away”<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> in the morning; but, pacing
            over the printless grass, I have wondered that, in such delightful situations,
            the sun was allowed to rise in solitary majesty, whilst my eyes alone hailed its
            beautifying beams. The webs of the evening have still been spread across the
            hedged path, unless some labouring man, trudging to work, disturbed the fairy
            structure; yet, in spite of this supineness, on joining the social circle, every
            tongue rang changes on the pleasures of the country. 
         </p>
         <p> Having frequently had occasion to make the same observation, in one of my
            solitary rambles, I was led to endeavour to trace the cause, and likewise to
            enquire why the poetry, written in the infancy of society, is most natural:
            which, strictly speaking (for natural is a very indefinite expression) is merely
            to say, that it is the transcript of immediate emotions, when fancy, awakened by
            the view of interesting objects, in all their native wildness and simplicity,
            was most actively at work. At such moments, sensibility quickly furnishes
            similes, and the sublimated spirits combine with happy facility—images,
            which spontaneously bursting on him, it is not necessary coldly to ransack the
            understanding or memory, till the laborious efforts of judgment exclude present
            sensations, and damp the fire of enthusiasm. 
         </p>
         <p> The effusions of a vigorous mind will, nevertheless, ever inform us how far the
            faculties have been enlarged by thought, and stored with knowledge. The richness
            of the soil even appears on the surface; and the result of profound thinking
            often mixing with playful grace in the reveries of the poet, smoothly
            incorporates with the ebullitions of animal spirits, when the finely-fashioned
            nerve vibrates acutely with rapture, or when relaxed by soft melancholy, a
            pleasing languor prompts the long-drawn sigh, and feeds the slowly falling tear. 
         </p>
         <p> The poet, the man of strong feelings, only gives us a picture of his mind when
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 280]</p><p class="pnoindent"> he was actually alone, conversing with himself, and marking
            the impression which nature made on his own heart. If, during these sacred
            moments, the idea of some departed friend—some tender recollection, when
            the soul was most alive to tenderness, intrudes unawares into his mind, the
            sorrow which it produces is artlessly, but poetically, expressed; and who can
            avoid sympathizing? 
         </p>
         <p> Love of man leads to devotion. Grand and sublime images strike the imagination.
            God is seen in every floating cloud, and comes from the misty mountain to
            receive the noblest homage of an intelligent creature—praise. How solemn
            is the moment, when all affections and remembrances fade before the sublime
            admiration which the wisdom and goodness of God inspires, when he is worshipped
            in a temple not made with hands, and the world seems to contain only the mind
            that formed and contemplates it! These are not the weak responses of ceremonial
            devotion; nor to express them would the poet need another poet’s aid. No: his
            heart burns within him, and he speaks the language of truth and nature, with
            resistless energy. 
         </p>
         <p> Inequalities, of course, are observable in his effusions; and a less vigorous
            imagination, with more taste, would have produced more elegance and uniformity.
            But as passages are softened or expunged, during the cooler moments of
            reflection, the understanding is gratified at the expence of those involuntary
            sensations which like the beauteous tints of an evening sky, are so evanescent
            that they melt into new forms before they can be analysed. For, however
            eloquently we may boast of our reason, man must often be delighted he cannot
            tell why, or his blunt feelings are not made to relish the beauties which
            nature, poetry, or any of the imitative arts afford. 
         </p>
         <p> The imagery of the ancients appears naturally to have been borrowed from the
            surrounding objects, and their mythology. When a hero is to be transported from
            one place to another, across pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural as one
            of the fleecy clouds, on which he has often gazed, scarcely conscious that he
            wished to make it his chariot? Again; when nature seems to present obstacles to
            his progress at almost every step, when the tangled forest and steep mountain
            stand as barriers, to pass over which, the mind longs for supernatural aid; an
            interposing deity, created by love or fear, who walks on the waves, and rules
            the storm, severely felt in the first attempts to cultivate a country, will
            receive from the impassioned fancy a local habitation and a name. 
         </p>
         <p> It would be a philosophical enquiry, and throw some light on the history of the
            human mind, to trace, as far as our information will allow us, the spontaneous
            feelings and ideas which have produced the images that now frequently appear
            unnatural, because they are remote, and disgusting, because they have been
            servilely copied by poets, whose habits of thinking and views of nature must
            have been different; for the understanding seldom disturbs the current of our
            present feelings without dissipating the gay clouds which fancy has been
            embracing; yet, it silently gives the colour to the whole tenor of them, and the
            reverie is over when truth is grossly violated, or imagery introduced, selected
            from books, and not from local manners, or popular prejudices. 
         </p>
         <p> In a more advanced state of civilization, a poet is rather a creature of art
            than nature; the books that he peruses in his youth, become a hot-bed, in which
            artificial fruits are produced, beautiful to a common eye, though they want the
            true hue and flavour. His images do not flow from his imagination, but are
            servile copies; and, like the works of the painters who copy ancient statues
            when they draw men and women of their own times, we acknowledge that the
            features are fine, and the proportions just, but still they are men of stone:
            insipid figures, that never convey to the mind the idea of a portrait taken from
            the life, where the soul gives spirit and homogeneity to the whole form. The
            silken wings of fancy are shrivelled by rules, and a desire of attaining
            elegance of diction occasions an attention to words, incompatable with sublime
            impassioned thoughts. 
         </p>
         <p> A boy of abilities, who has been taught the structure of verse at school, and
            been roused by emulation to compose rhymes whilst he was reading works of
            genius, may, by practice, produce pretty verses, and even become what is often
            termed an elegant poet; though his readers, without knowing well where the fault
            lies, do not find themselves warmly interested. In the productions of the poets
            who </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 281]</p><p class="pnoindent"> fasten on their affections, they see grosser defects, and the
            very images and allusions which shocked their taste; yet they do not appear as
            puerile or extrinsic in one as the other. Why? Because they did not appear so to
            the author. 
         </p>
         <p> It may sound paradoxical, after observing that those productions want vigour
            that are the work of imitation, in which the understanding violently directed,
            if not extinguished, the blaze of fancy, to assert, that though genius be
            allowed to be only another word for a strong imagination, the first observers of
            nature exercised their judgment much more than their imitators. But they
            exercised it to discriminate things, whilst their followers were busy borrowing
            sentiments and arranging words. 
         </p>
         <p> Boys who have received a classical education load their memory with words, and
            the correspondent ideas are, perhaps, never distinctly comprehended. As a proof
            of this assertion I must mention as a fact, that I have known many young people
            who could write tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets prettily together,
            when their prose themes showed the barrenness of their minds; or, more justly
            speaking, how superficial the cultivation must have been, which their
            understanding had received. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>, I know, has taken
            some pains to prove, that a strong mind, accidentally led to some particular
            study in which it excels, is a genius.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> Not to stop to investigate the causes which produced this
            happy strength of mind, it is sufficient to remark, that the world has agreed to
            denominate those men of genius, who have pursued a particular art or science,
            after the bent of nature has been displayed in obstinate perseverance or fond
            attachment to a favourite study. <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr.
               Johnson</a>, in fact, appears sometimes to be of the same opinion;
            especially when he observes "that <a href="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</a> looked on nature with the eye which she only gives to a
            poet."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p> But though it should be allowed that books conned at school may lead some youths
            to write poetry, I fear they will never be the poets who charm our cares to
            sleep, or extort admiration. They may diffuse taste, and polish the language,
            but I am apt to conclude that they will seldom have the energy to rouse the
            passions which amend the heart. 
         </p>
         <p> And, to return to the first object of discussion, the reason why most people are
            more interested by a scene described by a poet than by a view of nature,
            probably arises from the want of a lively imagination. The poet contrasts the
            prospect, and selecting the most picturesque parts in his camera, the judgment
            is directed, and the whole attention of the languid faculty turned towards the
            objects which excited the most forcible emotions in the poet’s heart, firing his
            imagination; the reader consequently feels the enlivened description, though he
            was not able to receive a first impression from the operations of his own mind. 
         </p>
         <p> Besides, it may be farther observed, that uncultivated minds are only to be
            moved by forcible representations. To rouse the thoughtless, objects must be
            contrasted, calculated to excite tumultuous emotions. The unsubstantial
            picturesque forms which a contemplative man gazes on, and often follows with
            ardour till mocked by a glimpse of unattainable excellence, appear to them the
            light vapours of a dreaming enthusiast, who gives up the substance for the
            shadow. It is not within that they seek amusement — their eyes are rarely
            turned back on themselves; of course, their emotions, though sometimes fervid,
            are always transient, and the nicer perceptions which distinguish the man of
            taste are not felt, or make such a slight impression as scarcely to excite any
            pleasurable sensations. Is it surprising, then, that fine scenery is often
            overlooked by those who yet may be delighted by the same imagery concentrated
            and contrasted by the poet? But even this numerous class is exceeded by
            witlings, who, anxious to appear to have wit and taste, do not allow their
            understandings, or feelings, any liberty: for instead of cultivating their
            faculties, and reflecting on their operations, they are busy collecting
            prejudices, and are pre-determined to admire what the suffrage of time announces
            excellent; not to store up a fund of amusement for themselves, but to enable
            them to talk. 
         </p>
         <p>These hints will assist the reader to trace some of the causes why the beauties
            of nature are not forcibly felt, when civilization and its canker-worm, luxury,
            have made considerable advances. Those calm emotions are not sufficiently lively
            to serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary, or even for the moderate pursuers of
            artificial pleasures. In the present state of society, the understanding must
            bring back the feelings to nature, or the sensibility must have attained such
            strength, as rather to be sharpened than </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 282]</p><p class="pnoindent"> destroyed by the strong
            exercise of passions. 
         </p>
         <p> That the most valuable things are liable to the greatest perversion, is,
            however, as trite as true. For the same sensibility, or quickness of senses,
            which makes a man relish the charms of nature, when sensation, rather than
            reason, imparts delight, frequently makes a libertine of him, by leading him to
            prefer the tumult of love, a little refined by sentiment, to the calm pleasure
            of affectionate friendship, in whose sober satisfactions reason, mixing her
            tranquilizing convictions, whispers that content, not happiness, is the reward,
            or consequence, of virtue in this world.
