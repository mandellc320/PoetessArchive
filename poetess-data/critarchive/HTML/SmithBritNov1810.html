         <p class=""><span class="largest">A</span>MONG those writers who have distinguished
            themselves in the polite literature of the present day, the late <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. <span class="smcaps">Charlotte
                  Smith</span></a> well deserves a place, both from the number and
            elegance of her publications. She was the eldest daughter of Nicholas Turner,
            esq. a gentleman of fortune, who possessed estates in Surrey and Sussex; a man,
            it is said, of an improved mind and brilliant conversation. She lost her mother
            when very young, and was brought up under the care of an aunt, whose ideas of
            female education were less favourable to mental accomplishments than those of
            her father. She received, therefore, rather a fashionable than a literary
            education, and she was left to gratify her taste for books by desultory reading,
            and almost by stealth. Her genius, indeed, early showed itself in a propensity
            to poetry; but she was introduced while very young to the gaieties and
            dissipation of London, and, becoming a wife before she was sixteen, was plunged
            into the cares of a married life before her fine genius had received all the
            advantages it might have gained by a culture more regular and persevering.

         <p> Her husband, Mr. Smith, was the younger son of a rich West-Indian merchant, and
            associated with him in the business. The marriage had been brought about by
            parents, and did not prove a happy one; it had probably been hastened on her
            side by the dread of a mother-in-law, as her father was on the point of marrying
            a second wife. The married pair lived at first in London, in the busy part of
            the town, but soon after took a house at Southgate. The husband had little
            application to business; and probably, of the young couple, neither party had
            much notion of economy. The management of the concern was soon resigned to the
            father of Mr. Smith, who purchased for them an estate in Hampshire called Lys
            Farm. Here <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> found her
            tastes for rural scenery and for elegant society gratified; but building and
            expensive improvements, joined to an increasing family, soon brought them into
            difficulties, which were not lessened by the death of her husband's
            grandfather, to whom Mr. Smith acted as executor, in the discharge of which
            office a litigation arose with the other branches of the family, which plunged
            them into lawsuits for life. The vexation attending these perplexities, together
            with the pecuniary embarrassments she was continually involved in, clouded the
            serenity of <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a>'s
            mind, and gave to her writings that bitter and querulous tone of complaint which
            is discernable in so many of them. 
         </p>
         <p> Possessed of a fine imagination, an ear and a taste for harmony, an elegant and
            correct style, the natural bent of <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs.
               Smith</a>'s genius seems</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page iii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> to have been more to poetry
            than to any other walk of literature. Her <span class="italics">Sonnets</span>, which was the first publication she gave to the
            world, were universally admired. That species of verse, which in this country
            may be reckoned rather an exotic, had at that time been but little cultivated.
            For plaintive, tender, and polished sentiment the Sonnet forms a proper vehicle,
            and <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a>'s success
            fixed at once her reputation as a poet of no mean class. They were published
            while her husband was in the King's Bench,<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> where she attended him with laudable assiduity,
            and exerted herself to further his liberation; her feelings upon which event she
            thus describes in a letter to a friend: "For more than a month I had shared
            the restraint of my husband amidst scenes of misery, of vice, and even of
            terror. Two attempts had, since my last residence among them, been made by the
            prisoners to procure their liberation by blowing up the walls of the house.
            Throughout the night appointed for this enterprise I remained dressed, watching
            at the window. After such scenes and such apprehensions, how deliciously
            soothing to my wearied spirits was the soft, pure air of the summer's
            morning, breathing over the dewy grass, as, having slept one night upon the
            road, we passed over the heaths of Surrey!" 
         </p>
         <p> Their difficulties, however, were far from being terminated; and the increasing
            derangement of Mr. Smith's affairs soon afterwards obliged them to leave
            England, and they were settled some time in a large gloomy chateau in Normandy,
            where <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> gave birth to

               l'Escaut</span>, a novel of the <a href="people.html#Prevostabbe">Abbé Prevôt</a>, a work of
            affecting pathos, though exceptionable with regard to its moral tendency. 
         </p>
         <p> Returning to England, they occupied for some time an ancient mansion belonging
            to the Mills' family, at Woodlading, in Sussex, where <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> wrote several of her
            poems. 
         </p>
         <p> An entire separation afterwards taking place between her and her husband, she
            removed with most of her children to a small cottage near Chichester, where she
            wrote her novel of <span class="italics">Emmeline</span> in the
            course of a few months. She afterwards resided in various places, mostly on the
            coast of Sussex; for she was particularly fond of the neighbourhood of the sea.
            The frequent change of scene which, either from necessity or inclination, she
            experienced, were no doubt favourable to that descriptive talent which forms a
            striking feature of her genius. Her frequent removals may be traced in her poems
            and other works. The name of the Arun is consecrated in poetry, and is often
            mentioned by her: </p>

         <p> Poets are apt to complain, and often take a pleasure in it; yet they should
            remember that the pleasure of their readers is only derived from the elegance
            and harmony with which they do it. The reader is a selfish being, and seeks only
            his own gratification. But for the language of complaint in plain prose, or the
            exasperations of personal resentment, he has seldom much sympathy. It is
            certain, however, that the life of this lady was a very chequered one. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> had a family of twelve
            children, six only of whom survived her. Her third son lost a limb in the
            service of his country, and afterwards fell sacrifice to the yellow fever at
            Barbadoes, whither he had gone to look after the family property. The severest
            stroke she met with was the loss of a favourite daughter, who died at Bath,
            where <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> also was for the
            recovery of her health. The young lady had been married to the Chevalier de
            Faville, a French emigrant. Her mother is said never entirely to have recovered
            from this affliction. 
         </p>
         <p> Her last removal was to Stoke, a village in Surrey, endeared to her by her
            having spent there many years of her childhood; and there she died Oct. 28th,
            1806, in her 57th year, after a tedious and painful illness. She was a widow at
            the time of her death, and, being in possession of her own fortune, had a
            prospect of greater ease in her pecuniary circumstances than she</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vi]</p><p class="pnoindent"> had
            for some time enjoyed. Her youngest son, who was advancing in the military
            career, fell a victim to the pestiferous climate of Surinam before her death,
            but the news had not reached her. 
         </p>
         <p> Though she was worn by illness, the powers of her mind retained their full
            vigour, and her last volume of poems, entitled <span class="italics">Beachy Head</span>, was in the press at the time of her decease;
            an elegant work, which no ways discredits her former performances. 
         </p>
         <p> She was the author of several publications for children and young people, which
            are executed with great taste and elegance, and communicate, in a pleasing way,
            much knowledge of botany and natural history, of which two studies she was very
            fond. That entitled <span class="italics">Conversations</span>
            is interspersed with beautiful little descriptive poems on natural objects. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> is most known to
            readers in general by her novels; yet they seem to have been less the
            spontaneous offspring of her mind than her poems. She herself represents them as
            being written to supply money for those emergencies which, from the perplexed
            state of her affairs, she was often thrown into; but, though not of the first
            order, they hold a respectable rank among that class of publications. They are
            written in a style correct and elegant; they show a knowledge of life, and of
            genteel life; and there is much beauty in the descriptive scenery, which <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs. Smith</a> was one of the first to
            introduce. Descriptions, of whatever beauty, are but little attended to in a
            novel of high interest, particu- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page vii]</p><p class="pnoindent">larly if introduced, as they often
            are, during a period of anxious suspense for the hero or heroine; but are very
            properly placed, at judicious intervals, in compositions of which variety rather
            than deep pathos, and elegance rather than strength, are the characteristics. 
         </p>
         <p> The two most finished novels of <a href="people.html#SmithCharlotte">Mrs.
               Smith.</a> are <span class="italics">Emmeline</span> and
            <span class="italics">Celestina</span>. In the first she
            is supposed to have drawn her own character, (with what degree of impartiality
            others must judge,) in that of Mrs. Stafford. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="italics">Celestina</span> is not inferior to
            <span class="italics">Emmeline</span> in the conduct of
            the piece, and possesses still more beauties of description. The romantic scenes
            in the south of France are rich and picturesque. The story of Jesse and her
            lover is interesting, as well as that of Jaquelina. 
         </p>
         <p>The <span class="italics">Old Manor-House</span><span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> is said to be the most popular of the
            author's productions. The best drawn character in it is that of a wealthy
            old lady who keeps all her relations in constant dependence, and will not be
            persuaded to name her heir. This was written during the war with America; and
            the author takes occasion, as also in many other of her publications, to show
            the strain of her politics. 
         </p>
         <p> She also wrote <span class="italics">Desmond</span>, <span class="italics">The Wanderings of Warwick</span>, <span class="italics">Montalbert</span>, and many others, to the
            number of thirty-eight volumes. They all show a knowledge of life, and facility
            of execution, without having any very strong features, or particularly aiming to
            illustrate any moral truth. The situations and the scenery are often</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page viii]</p><p class="pnoindent"> romantic; the characters and the conversations are from common life. 
         </p>
         <p> Her later publications would have been more pleasing, if the author, in the
            exertions of fancy, could have forgotten herself; but the asperity of invective
            and the querulousness of complaint too frequently cloud the happier exertions of
            her imagination. 
         </p>
         <p> Another publication of this lady's ought to have been mentioned, <span class="italics">The Romance of real Life</span>, a very
            entertaining work, consisting of a selection of remarkable trials from the
            <span class="italics">Causes
               Célèbres</span>.<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> The title,
            though a happy and a just one, had the inconvenience of misleading many readers,
            who really thought it a novel. Their mistake was pardonable; for few novels
            present incidents so wonderful as are to be found in these surprising stories,
            which rest upon the sanction of judicial records.
