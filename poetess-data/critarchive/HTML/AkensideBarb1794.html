         <p class="pnoindent"><span class="largest">D</span><span class="smcaps">idactic</span>, or preceptive Poetry, seems to include a solecism, for the
            end of Poetry is to please, and of Didactic precept the object is instruction.
            It is however a species of Poetry which has been cultivated from the earliest
            stages of society; at first, probably, for the simple purpose of retaining, by
            means of the regularity of measure and the charms of harmony, the precepts of
            agricultural wisdom and the aphorisms of economical experience.<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> When Poetry came to be cultivated for
            its own sake, it </p>

            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 2]</p><p class="pnoindent">was natural to esteem the Didactic, as in that view it certainly is,
            as a species of inferior merit compared with those which are more peculiarly the
            work of the imagination; and accordingly in the more splendid era of our own
            Poetry it has been much less cultivated than many others. Afterwards, when
            Poetry was become an art, and the more obvious sources of description and
            adventure were in some measure exhausted, the Didactic was resorted to, as
            affording that novelty and variety which began to be the great desideratum in
            works of fancy. This species of writing is likewise favoured by the diffusion of
            knowledge, by which many subjects become proper for general reading, which in a
            less informed state of society, would have savoured of pedantry and abstruse
            speculation. For Poetry cannot descend to teach the elements of any art or
            science, or confine itself to that regular arrangement and clear brevity which
            suits the communication of unknown truths. In fact, the Muse would </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 3]</p><p class="pnoindent">make a very indifferent school-mistress. Whoever therefore reads a Didactic
            Poem ought to come to it with a previous knowledge of his subject; and whoever
            writes one, ought to suppose such a knowledge in his readers. If he is obliged
            to explain technical terms, to refer continually to critical notes, and to
            follow a system step by step with the patient exactness of a teacher, his Poem,
            however laboured, will be a bad Poem. His office is rather to throw a lustre on
            such prominent parts of his system as are most susceptible of poetical ornament,
            and to kindle the enthusiasm of those feelings which the truths he is conversant
            with are fitted to inspire. In that beautiful Poem the Essay on
            Man,<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span>
            the <span class="italics">system</span> of the author, if in reality he had any
            system, is little attended to, but those passages which breathe the love of
            Virtue are read with delight, and fix themselves on the memory. Where the reader
            has this previous knowledge of the subject, which we have mentioned as
            necessary, the <span class="italics">art</span> of </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 4]</p><p class="pnoindent">the Poet becomes itself a source of
            pleasure, and sometimes in proportion to the remoteness of the subject from the
            more obvious province of Poetry; we are delighted to find with how much
            dexterity the artist of verse can avoid a technical term, how neatly he can turn
            an uncouth word, and with how much grace embellish a scientific idea. Who does
            not admire the infinite art with which <a href="people.html#DarwinErasmus">Dr. <span class="smcaps">Darwin</span></a> has described the machine of
            <a href="people.html#ArkwrightRichard">Sir <span class="smcaps">Richard Arkwright</span></a>.<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span>
            His verse is a piece of mechanism as complete in its kind as that which he
            describes. Allured perhaps too much by this artificial species of excellence,
            and by the hopes of novelty, hardly any branch of knowledge has been so
            abstruse, or so barren of delight as not to have afforded a subject to the
            Didactic Poet. Even the loathsomeness of disease and the dry maxims of medical
            knowledge have been decorated with the charms of Poetry. Many of these pieces
            however owe all their entertainment to frequent digressions. </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 5]</p><p class="pnoindent">Where
            these arise naturally out of the subject, as the description of sheep-shearing
            feast in <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#DyerGeorge">Dyer</a></span>, or the praises of Italy in the Georgics, they are not only
            allowable but graceful; but if forced, as is the story of <span class="smcaps">Orpheus</span> and <span class="smcaps">Eurydice</span>
            in the same Poem,<span class="sup"><a href="#5" id="back5"><sup>5</sup></a> </span> they can be considered in no other light than
            that of beautiful monsters, and injure the piece they are meant to adorn. The
            subject of a Didactic Poem therefore ought to be such as is in itself attractive
            to the man of taste, for otherwise all attempts to make it so by adventitious
            ornaments, will be but like loading with jewels and drapery a figure originally
            defective and ill made.
         </p>
         <p>Of all the subjects which have engaged the attention of Didactic Poets, there is
            not perhaps a happier than that made choice of by <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a></span>, <span class="italics">The Pleasures of Imagination</span>; in
            which every step of the disquisition calls up objects of the most attractive
            kind, and Fancy is made as it were to hold a mirror to her own charms.
            Imagination is the </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 6]</p><p class="pnoindent">very source and well-head of Poetry, and nothing
            forced or foreign to the Muse could easily flow from such a subject. Accordingly
            we see that the author has kept close to his system, and has admitted neither
            episode nor digression: the allegory in the second book, which is introduced for
            the purpose of illustrating his theory, being all that can properly be called
            ornament in this whole Poem. It must be acknowledged however, that engaging as
            his subject is to minds prepared to examine it, to the generality of readers it
            must appear dry and abstruse. It is a work which offers us entertainment, but
            not of that easy kind amidst which the mind remains passive, and has nothing to
            do but to receive impressions. Those who have studied the metaphysics of mind,
            and who are accustomed to investigate abstract ideas, will read it with a lively
            pleasure; but those who seek mere amusement in a Poem, will find many far
            inferior ones better suited to their purpose. The judicious admirer of </p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 7]</p><p class="pnoindent"><span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a></span> will not call people from the fields and the
            highways to partake of his feast; he will wish none to read that are not capable
            of understanding him.

         <p>The ground-work of <span class="italics">The Pleasures of
               Imagination</span> is to be found in <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span>’s Essays on the
            same subject, published in the Spectator.<span class="sup"><a href="#6" id="back6"><sup>6</sup></a> </span> Except in the book which treats on
            Ridicule, and even of that the hint is there given, our author follows nearly
            the same track; and he is indebted to them not only for the leading thoughts and
            grand division of his subject, but for much of the colouring also: for the
            papers of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span> are wrought up with so much elegance of language,
            and adorned with so many beautiful illustrations, that they are equal to the
            most finished Poem. Perhaps the obligations of the Poet to the Essay-writer are
            not sufficiently adverted to, the latter being only slightly mentioned in the
            preface to the Poem. It is not meant however to insinuate that <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a></span> had not various </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 8]</p><p class="pnoindent">other sources of his ideas.
            He sat down to this work, which was published at the early age of three and
            twenty, warm from the schools of ancient philosophy, whose spirit he had deeply
            imbibed, and full of enthusiasm for the treasures of Greek and Roman literature.
            The works of no author have a more classic air than those of our Poet. His hymn
            to the Naïads<span class="sup"><a href="#7" id="back7"><sup>7</sup></a> </span> shews the most intimate
            acquaintance with their mythology. Their laws, their arts, their liberty, were
            equally objects of his warm admiration, and are frequently referred to in
            various parts of his Poems. He was fond of the Platonic philosophy, and mingled
            with the splendid visions of the Academic school, ideas of the fair and
            beautiful in morals and in taste, gathered from the writings of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#ShaftesburyAnthonyAshleyCooper">Shaftesbury</a></span>, <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#HutchesonFrancis">Hutchinson</a></span>, and others
            of that stamp, who then very much engaged the notice of the public. Educated in
            the university of Edinburgh, he joined to his classic literature, the keen
            discriminating spirit of metaphysic in-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 9]</p><p class="pnoindent">quiry, and the taste for moral
            beauty which has so much distinguished our northern seminaries, and which the
            celebrity of their professors, and the genius of the place has never failed of
            communicating to their disciples. Thus prepared, by nature with genius, and by
            education with the previous studies and habits of thinking, he was peculiarly
            fitted for writing a philosophical Poem. 
         </p>
         <p>The first lines contain the definition of his subject, which he has judiciously
            varied from his master <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span>, who expressly
            confines the pleasures of imagination to "such as arise from visible
            objects only;" and divides them into "the primary pleasures of the
            imagination, which entirely proceed from such objects as are before our eyes,
            and those secondary pleasures of the imagination which flow from the ideas of
            visible objects when the objects are not actually before the eye, but are called
            up into our memories, or formed into agreeable visions of things that are either
            absent or fictitious."<span class="sup"><a href="#8" id="back8"><sup>8</sup></a> </span> This </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 10]</p><p class="pnoindent">definition seems
            to exclude a blind man from any share whatever of those pleasures, and yet who
            would deny that the elegant mind of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#BlacklockThomas">Blacklock</a></span> was capable of
            receiving and even of imparting them in no small degree. Our author therefore
            includes every source by which, through any of our senses or perceptions, we
            receive notices of the world around us; as well as the reflex pleasures derived
            from the imitative arts. </p>

         <p>After this clear and concise definition, and a lively and appropriate invocation
            to the powers of Fancy guided by Truth and Liberty, the Author begins by
            unfolding the Platonic idea that the universe with all its forms of material
            beauty was called into </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 11]</p><p class="pnoindent">being from its pototype [<span class="italics">sic</span>], existing from all eternity in the divine
            mind. The different propensities that human beings are born with to various
            pursuits, are enumerated in some very beautiful lines, and <span class="italics">those</span> are declared to be the most noble which lead
            a chosen few to the love and contemplation of the supreme beauty by the love and
            contemplation of his works. The Poet thus immediately, and at the very outset,
            dignifies his theme, by connecting it with the sublimest feelings the human mind
            is capable of entertaining, feelings without which the various scenes of this
            beautiful universe degenerate into gaudy shows, fit to catch the eye of
            children, but uninteresting to the heart and affections; and those laws and
            properties about which Philosophy busies herself, into a bewildering mass of
            unconnected experiments and independent facts. These lines afford more than one
            example of climax, graceful repetition, and richness of poetic language. The
            subject is then branched out into the three grand divisions marked </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 12]</p><p class="pnoindent">by <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span>. [<span class="italics">sic</span>] the <span class="italics">Sublime</span>, the <span class="italics">Wonderful</span>, and the <span class="italics">Beautiful</span>. Each is
            exemplified with equal judgment and taste, but the sublime is perhaps expressed
            with most energy, as it certainly was most congenial to the mind of our author.
            The passage of which the thought is borrowed from <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Longinus">Longinus</a></span>, <span class="italics">Say why was man so eminently raised</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a> </span> is almost unequalled in grandeur of thought and loftiness of
            expression, yet it has not the appearance, as some other parts of the Poem have,
            of being laboured into excellence, but rather of being thrown off at once amidst
            the swell and fervency of a kindled imagination. The final cause of each of
            these propensities is happily insinuated; of the sense of the sublime, to lead
            us to the contemplation of the Supreme Being; of that of novelty to awaken us to
            constant activity; of beauty to mark out to us the objects most perfect in their
            kind. Thus does he make Philosophy and Poetry to go hand in hand. The
            exemplification of the love of novelty in the audi-</p>

            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 13]</p><p class="pnoindent">ence of the <span class="italics">village matron</span> who tells of <span class="italics">witching rhymes and evil spirits</span>, is highly
            wrought. The author however had doubtless in his mind not only the Essays of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span>, which were immediately under his eye, but that passage
            in another paper where he represents the circle at his landlady's closing
            their ranks, and crowding round the fire at the conclusion of every story of
            ghosts: <span class="italics">Around the beldam all arrect</span><span class="sup"><a href="#11" id="back11"><sup>11</sup></a> </span><span class="italics">they hang. Congealed with shivering sighs</span>, very
            happily expresses the effects of that kind of terror, which makes a man shrink
            into himself, and feel afraid, as it were, to draw a full inspiration.<span class="sup"><a href="#12" id="back12"><sup>12</sup></a> </span> It may be doubted however
            whether the attraction which is felt towards these kind of sensations when they
            rise to terror, can be fairly referred to the love of novelty. It seems rather
            to depend on that charm, afterwards touched upon, which is attached to every
            thing that strongly stirs and agitates the mind. In his description of Beauty,

         <p>The Poem continues in a high strain of noble enthusiasm to the end of the book,
            and concludes with an invocation to the genius of ancient Greece, with whose
            philosophy and high sense of liberty he was equally enamoured. It is easy for
            the reader who is conversant in the writings of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#ShaftesburyAnthonyAshleyCooper">Shaftesbury</a></span> and <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#HutchesonFrancis">Hutchinson</a></span> to perceive

            importance by building the throne of virtue so near the bower of beauty. The
            book is complete in itself; and if we may be allowed to hazard a conjecture,

         <p>The second book opens with a complaint, founded perhaps rather in a partiality

            Philosophy and Poetry. To the same classic prejudice (to which a good scholar is
            very prone) may be attributed the mention of the courtly compliments which
            debased the verse of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#TassoTorquato">Tasso</a></span>: and the
            superstitious legends which employed the pencil of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Raphael">Raphael</a></span> in contradistinction to
            the works of the ancients, as if, in sober truth, any one was prepared to assert

            accession to the Pleasures of the Imagination from adventitious circumstances,
            of which he gives various instances: that of the Newtonian theory of the
            rainbow<span class="sup"><a href="#18" id="back18"><sup>18</sup></a> </span> seems too abstruse even for a philosophical Poem; it may be
            doubted whether, if understood, it is of a nature to mix well with the pleasure
            of colours; it certainly does not accord well with that of verse. The influence
            of Passion is next considered, and the mysterious pleasure which is mixed with
            the energies and emotions of those passions that are in their own nature
            painful. To solve this problem, which has been one in all ages, a long allegory
            is introduced, which, though wrought up with a good deal of the decoration of
            Poetry, is nearly as difficult to comprehend as the problem itself. It begins
            with presenting a scene of desolation, <span class="italics">where the
               parched adder dies;</span><span class="sup"><a href="#19" id="back19"><sup>19</sup></a> </span> this

            is only introduced to refer us to the Genius, and the Genius shifts his scenes
            like the pictures of a magic lantern, before he explains to us the scope and
            purport of the visions. The figures of Pleasure and Virtue are in a good measure

            wrought up with much strength of colouring. The story is in fact the
            introduction of evil, accounted for by the necessity of training the pupil of
            Providence to the love of Virtue, the supreme good, by withdrawing from him for
            a while the allurements of pleasure; but why his very suffering should be
            attended with pleasure, which was the phenomenon to be accounted for, is not so
            clearly made out. We are told indeed that the youth is willing to bear the
            frowns of the son of <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Nemesis">Nemesis</a></span> in all their horrors, provided </p>

            So far indeed we may gather from this representation, that pleasure is always
            annexed to the exercise of our moral feelings, which is probably the true
            account of the matter: but this truth is rather darkened than illustrated by the
            fable, which does not satisfactorily explain <span class="italics">how</span>

            begins, agreeably to the system he had embraced, with deducing all deviations
            from rectitude or propriety, from false opinions, imbibed in early youth, which
            attract the imagination by fallacious shows of good. Of these false opinions the
            more serious lead to vice, while those which refer to the less important
            particulars of our conduct betray to ridicule, the source of which is <span class="italics">incongruity</span>, and its final cause the assisting the

         <p>The theory is beautiful and well supported. Illustrations of every different
            species of the ridiculous are given in the Poem, the notes are judicious, and
            tend still more to elucidate the subject. Still it must be confessed the theme
            is not a poetical one; and it may be even questioned how far it is connected
            with the subject; for the sense of ridicule is of a very peculiar nature, and is
            hardly included, in common language, among the Pleasures of the Imagination. If
            however the reader is inclined to be dissatisfied with this part of his
            entertainment, let him recollect, that if it affords him less pleasure, it
            probably cost the author more pains than any other portion of his Poem. It is
            asserted that under the appellation of <span class="smcaps">Momion</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#25" id="back25"><sup>25</sup></a> </span> the writer has thrown

            of a just moral taste can reflect without regret that a capital work of one of
            our best Poets, composed in the height of his reputation, and during the </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 25]</p><p class="pnoindent">perfection of all his powers, should have no other end than to
            gratify the spleen of an offended author, and to record the petty warfare of
            rival wits. It is an observation of the excellent <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#HartleyDavid">Hartley</a></span>, that those studies
            which confine the mind within the exercise of its own powers, as criticism,
            poetry, and most philological pursuits, are apt to generate a supercilious
            deportment and an anxious and selfish regard to reputation: whereas the pursuit
            of truth, carrying the mind <span class="italics">out</span> of itself to large
            views of nature and Providence, fills it with sublime and generous feelings. The
            remark must undoubtedly be taken with great latitude, but it seems to be not
            entirely unfounded. 
         </p>
         <p>Having dismissed the account of Ridicule, so little susceptible of being adorned
            by his efforts, the Poet rises into a higher strain, and investigates that
            wonderful phenomenon from whence the Pleasures of Imagination chiefly seem to
            arise, the mysterious connection of moral ideas with visible objects. </p>

            it owing to early and frequent associations? He decides for the latter, and
            beautifully illustrates that great law on which the power of memory entirely
            depends. This leads him to consider the powers of Imagination as residing in the
            human mind, when, after being stored by means of memory, with ideas of all that

            call beautiful are so really and in their own nature, and must appear so to any
            being possessed of faculties capable of appreciating them. The other that beauty
            is a mere arbitrary thing, a sort of pleasing enchantment spread over the face
            of nature, a delusion, under which we see charms that do not at all result from

            as the most philosophical. It is not, we presume, the most pleasing, nor the
            most favourable to the dignity and importance of the Pleasures of Imagination;
            for their boasted connection with <span class="italics">truth</span> vanishes,
            except indeed in this sense that beauty as an arbitrary mark is used with
            precision, and is constantly found to denote the health and soundness of the
            object in which it appears to reside, and consequently is made subservient to
            utility; but the beautiful climax is destroyed by which the inferior kinds are
            connected with moral beauty, for how can what is real be connected with what is
            imaginary? unless indeed, what would be a very dangerous doctrine, the sense of
            <span class="italics">moral beauty</span> itself were supposed to be
            dependent on our peculiar formation, and adapted only to our present state of
            existence. The Poet has here closely copied from <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AddisonJoseph">Addison</a></span>, both in opening
            the thought, and in the simile with which he illustrates it. He loses sight

            peculiar bias which is impressed upon different minds towards the great, or the

            elegant, chaste, classical, and correct: not marked with strong traits of
            originality, not ardent nor exuberant. His enthusiasm was rather of that kind
            which is kindled by reading and imbibing the spirit of authors, than by
            contemplating at first hand the works of nature. As a versifier <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</a></span> is allowed to stand amongst those who have given the
            most finished models of blank verse. His periods are long but harmonious, the

            however is somewhat allied to stiffness. His verse is sometimes feeble through
            too rich a redundancy of ornament, and sometimes laboured into a degree of
            obscurity from too anxious a desire of avoiding natural and simple expressions.
            We do not conceive of him as <span class="italics">pouring easy his

            equal not to be in some degree monotonous. He is fond of compound epithets, led

            air to his composi-</p>

         <p>That an author who lived to near fifty should have produced his most capital work
            at three and twenty, seems to imply (as his professional studies did not cause
            him to lay aside his poetical pursuits) a genius more early than extensive, a
            mind more refined than capacious. And that this was the case in reality, will
            appear from his having employed himself during several years in correcting and
            entirely new moulding this his favourite Poem. To correct to a certain degree is
            the duty of a man of sense, but always to correct will not be the employment of
            a man of spirit. It betrays a mind rather brooding with fond affection over old
            productions, than inspired by a fresh stream of new ideas. The flowers of fancy
            are apt to lose their odour by much handling, the glow is gone and the ear
            itself after a certain time loses its tact amidst repeated </p>

         <p>The Edition which he was preparing was however left in too imperfect a state to
            justify its being presented to the public, at least of superseding the complete
            one which is here given, and which passed rapidly through many editions soon
            after its first appearance. In the posthumous Poem the ordonnance is greatly
            changed: <span class="italics">Novelty</span> is left out as a primary source
            of the Pleasure of the Imagination, and placed among the adventitious
            circumstances which only increase it: the greatest part of the lines on Ridicule
            are also omitted, and he has abandoned the idea of its being the test of truth,
            an idea which had given offence to the severer moralists. Instead of the
            allegory of Virtue and <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Euphrosyne">Euphrosyne</a></span>, the third book
            consists of a story concerning <span class="smcaps"><a href="people.html#Solon">Solon</a></span>, on which <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. <span class="smcaps">Johnson</span></a> makes this single observation, that it is <span class="italics">too long</span>.

            the intended solution. Of the fourth book the beginning is barely sketched. But
            had the whole been completed, we may venture to pronounce that, if the system
            was improved, the Poetry would have been weaker. He has amplified what had
            before a tendency to be redundant; he has rendered abstruse what was before
