         <p><a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">J<span class="smcaps">oanna</span> B<span class="smcaps">aillie</span></a> holds that rank amongst our elder
            					modern authors, and her poetry is so connected with that re-awakening of our
            					literature which took place about the commencement of the present century, that
            					whatever she writes, however slight, or however unequal to the works which made
            					her fame, has a peculiar claim to respectful attention. Of <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a>'s intellectual
            					strength, of her profound knowledge of the workings of passion, rendered more
            					extraordinary by the placidity with which she herself delineates them—of
            						<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a>'s genius
            					and language, which are both so essentially old-English, deep, sound, vigorous,
            					unfeigned, and unadulterate—we are proud to express our admiration. It
            					would afford a subject for a long and not uninteresting article to point out
            the
            					striking difference in the mind and writings of the literary women of thirty
            and
            					forty years ago, and the literary women of the present time: those who have not
            					perused their writings in connexion, will hardly believe how great is the
            					difference;—what a commentary the perusal affords on the entire change
            					that has obtained in habits, manners, feelings, education, tastes, and life!
            					Amongst the elders—with <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a> at their head, as regards
            					mind—the distinguishing features are nerve, simplicity, vigour,
            					continuity, unambitious earnestness, and good English. We find also elaborate
            					and skilfully-developed plots. Amongst our distinguished women of later date,
            we
            					find accomplishment, grace, brilliancy, sentiment, scenery poetically sketched,
            					and character acutely handled; talent in all shapes and ways, but not so much
            					that can claim the name of genius. There is nothing of what we have called
            					continuity. Writing little but detached tales or novels, which, however clever
            					are only volumes of episodes, separate scenes, and striking characters, most
            of
            					them unconnected with the main business of the book—it is as <span class="italics">sketchers</span>, whether for vivacity or pathos, nature
            					or art; as <span class="italics">sketchers</span>, whether of the country, the
            					town, or the heart, of life or of manners, that our gifted women are now chiefly
            					distinguished. In the female poetry too of the present day, fascinating
            					tenderness, brilliancy of fancy, and beauty of feeling, stand in the place of
            					sustained loftiness of imagination, and compact artist-like diction. Our elder
            					literary women were, in the spirit of their intellect, more essentially
            					masculine; our younger ones are integrally feminine—women of fashionable
            					as well as studious life, women generally, who not only write books but abound
            					in elegant accomplishments.
         </p>
         <p>We have not, and are not likely to have at present, another <a href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wolstencroft</a> (we merely
            					speak of her as having exhibited grasp of mind), another <a href="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs. Inchbald</a>, another <a href="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</a>—<a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a> is their only
            					representative; adding, to the power of mind which they possessed, that
            					dignified play of fancy, that amplitude of calm, bold thought, and that
            					"accomplishment of verse"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> which they possessed not. Modern
            					imaginative literature in England owes much to her 'Plays on the
            						Passions;'<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> perhaps more than to any other
            					publication except '<a href="people.html#PercyThomas">Percy</a>'s Reliques;' at all events, our greatest
            					poets, who were young when her plays appeared, have nearly all borne testimony
            					to the advantage and delight with which they perused them. With all this, the
            					name of <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a> is not
            					buzzed and blazoned about as very inferior names are; her works do not attain
            					the honour of calf and gold in libraries where inferior works shine; poetical
            					readers of strong sensibility and uncultivated taste do not dote upon
            						'Basil,' or quote from
            					'Ethwald;' and we never, by any chance, saw a line of
            					hers transcribed in an album! One or two of her Shakespearian snatches of song
            					have been set to music; but, (to quote the words of an able critic,) "The
            					celebrity of <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a> has
            					been of a most peculiar nature; her fame has had about it a peculiar purity.
            It
            					has been the unparticipated treasure of the world of taste and
            						intellect."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span> We know that with this illustrious authoress there is a
            					noble carelessness of praise, partly consequent on her years, her standing in
            					society, and her having simply written at the instigation of her own genius;
            					obeying the voice from the shrine, and not the command of the outer-court
            					worshippers; but still, we feel vexed to see women of later date, and, however
            					gifted, every way inferior to <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna
               						Baillie</a>, written about, and likenessed, and lithographed, before <span class="smcaps">her</span>—the senior and superior of all.
         </p>
         <p>These casual remarks will prove that we appreciate <a href="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</a>; we can, therefore,
            					with better grace express our regret that she has just published the little
            					work, the name of which heads this notice. It is controversial, and controversy
            					is best left to learned divines—certainly better left alone by ladies.
