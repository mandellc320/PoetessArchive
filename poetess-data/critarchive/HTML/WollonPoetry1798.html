         <p><span class="largest">A</span> TASTE for rural scenes, in the present state of
            society, appears to be very often an artificial sentiment, rather inspired by
            poetry and romances, than a real perception of the beauties of nature. But, as
            it is reckoned a proof of refined taste to praise the calm pleasures which the
            country affords, the theme is never exhausted. Yet it may be made a question,
            whether this ro- </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 160]</p><p class="pnoindent"> mantic kind of declamation, has much effect on
            the conduct of those, who leave, for a season, the crowded cities in which they
            were bred.
         </p>
         <p>I have been led to these reflections, by observing, when I have resided for any
            length of time in the country, how few people seem to contemplate nature with
            their own eyes. I have "brushed the dew away"<span class="sup"><a href="#2" id="back2"><sup>2</sup></a> </span> in the morning; but,
            pacing over the printless grass, I have wondered that, in such delightful
            situations, the sun was allowed to rise in solitary majesty, whilst my eyes
            alone hailed its beautifying beams. The webs of the evening have still been
            spread across the hedged path, unless some labouring man, trudging to work,
            disturbed the fairy structure; yet, in spite of this supineness, when I
            joined</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 161]</p><p class="pnoindent"> the social circle, every tongue rang changes on the
            pleasures of the country.
         </p>
         <p>Having frequently had occasion to make the same observation, I was led to
            endeavour, in one of my solitary rambles, to trace the cause, and likewise to
            enquire why the poetry written in the infancy of society, is most natural:
            which, strictly speaking (for <span class="italics">natural</span> is a very
            indefinite expression) is merely to say, that it is the transcript of immediate
            sensations, in all their native wildness and simplicity, when fancy, awakened by
            the sight of interesting objects, was most actively at work. At such moments,
            sensibility quickly furnishes similes, and the sublimated spirits combine
            images, which rising spontaneously, it is not necessary coldly to ransack the
            understanding or memory, till the laborious efforts of judg-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 162]</p><p class="pnoindent">ment
            exclude present sensations, and damp the fire of enthusiasm.
         </p>
         <p>The effusions of a vigorous mind, will ever tell us how far the understanding has
            been enlarged by thought, and stored with knowledge. The richness of the soil
            even appears on the surface; and the result of profound thinking, often mixing,
            with playful grace, in the reveries of the poet, smoothly incorporates with the
            ebullitions of animal spirits, when the finely fashioned nerve vibrates acutely
            with rapture, or when, relaxed by soft melancholy, a pleasing languor prompts
            the long-drawn sigh, and feeds the slowly falling tear.
         </p>
         <p>The poet, the man of strong feelings, gives us only an image of his mind, when he
            was actually alone, conversing with himself, and marking the impression which
            nature had made on his</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 163]</p><p class="pnoindent">own heart.—If, at this sacred moment,
            the idea of some departed friend, some tender recollection when the soul was
            most alive to tenderness, intruded unawares into his thoughts, the sorrow which
            it produced is artlessly, yet poetically expressed—and who can avoid
            sympathizing?
         </p>
         <p>Love to man leads to devotion—grand and sublime images strike the
            imagination—God is seen in every floating cloud, and comes from the misty
            mountain to receive the noblest homage of an intelligent creature—praise.
            How solemn is the moment, when all affections and remembrances fade before the
            sublime admiration which the wisdom and goodness of God inspires, when he is
            worshipped in a <span class="italics">temple not made with hands</span>, and
            the world seems to contain only the mind</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 164]</p><p class="pnoindent"> that formed, and the mind
            that contemplates it! These are not the weak responses of ceremonial devotion;
            nor, to express them, would the poet need another poet's aid: his heart
            burns within him, and he speaks the language of truth and nature with resistless
            energy.
         </p>
         <p>Inequalities, of course, are observable in his effusions; and a less vigorous
            fancy, with more taste, would have produced more elegance and uniformity; but,
            as passages are softened or expunged during the cooler moments of reflection,
            the understanding is gratified at the expence of those involuntary sensations,
            which, like the beauteous tints of an evening sky, are so evanescent, that they
            melt into new forms before they can be analyzed. For however eloquently we may
            boast of</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 165]</p><p class="pnoindent">our reason, man must often be delighted he cannot tell why,
            or his blunt feelings are not made to relish the beauties which nature, poetry,
            or any of the imitative arts, afford.
         </p>
         <p>The imagery of the ancients seems naturally to have been borrowed from
            surrounding objects and their mythology. When a hero is to be transported from
            one place to another, across pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural, as one
            of the fleecy clouds on which the poet has often gazed, scarcely conscious that
            he wished to make it his chariot? Again, when nature seems to present obstacles
            to his progress at almost every step, when the tangled forest and steep mountain
            stand as barriers, to pass over which the mind longs for supernatural aid; an
            interposing deity, who walks on the waves,</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 166]</p><p class="pnoindent">and rules the storm,
            severely felt in the first attempts to cultivate a country, will receive from
            the impassioned fancy "a local habitation and a name."
         </p>
         <p>It would be a philosophical enquiry, and throw some light on the history of the
            human mind, to trace, as far as our information will allow us to trace, the
            spontaneous feelings and ideas which have produced the images that now
            frequently appear unnatural, because they are remote; and disgusting, because
            they have been servilely copied by poets, whose habits of thinking, and views of
            nature must have been different; for, though the understanding seldom disturbs
            the current of our present feelings, without dissipating the gay clouds which
            fancy has been embracing, yet it silently gives the colour to the whole tenour
            of them, and the</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 167]</p><p class="pnoindent">dream is over, when truth is grossly violated, or
            images introduced, selected from books, and not from local manners or popular
            prejudices. 
         </p>
         <p>In a more advanced state of civilization, a poet is rather the creature of art,
            than of nature. The books that he reads in his youth, become a hot-bed in which
            artificial fruits are produced, beautiful to the common eye, though they want
            the true hue and flavour. His images do not arise from sensations; they are
            copies; and, like the works of the painters who copy ancient statues when they
            draw men and women of their own times, we acknowledge that the features are
            fine, and the proportions just; yet they are men of stone; insipid figures, that
            never convey to the mind the idea of a portrait taken from life, where the soul
            gives</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 168]</p><p class="pnoindent">spirit and homogeneity to the whole. The silken wings of
            fancy are shrivelled by rules; and a desire of attaining elegance of diction,
            occasions an attention to words, incompatible with sublime, impassioned
            thoughts. 
         </p>
         <p>A boy of abilities, who has been taught the structure of verse at school, and
            been roused by emulation to compose rhymes whilst he was reading works of
            genius, may, by practice, produce pretty verses, and even become what is often
            termed an elegant poet: yet his readers, without knowing what to find fault
            with, do not find themselves warmly interested. In the works of the poets who
            fasten on their affections, they see grosser faults, and the very images which
            shock their taste in the modern; still they do not appear as puerile or
            extrinsic in one as the</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 169]</p><p class="pnoindent">other.—Why?—because they did not
            appear so to the author. 
         </p>
         <p>It may sound paradoxical, after observing that those productions want vigour,
            that are merely the work of imitation, in which the understanding has violently
            directed, if not extinguished, the blaze of fancy, to assert, that, though
            genius be only another word for exquisite sensibility, the first observers of
            nature, the true poets, exercised their understanding much more than their
            imitators. But they exercised it to discriminate things, whilst their followers
            were busy to borrow sentiments and arrange words. 
         </p>
         <p>Boys who have received a classical education, load their memory with words, and
            the correspondent ideas are perhaps never distinctly comprehended. As a proof of
            this assertion,</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 170]</p><p class="pnoindent">I must observe, that I have known many young people
            who could write tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets prettily together,
            when their prose themes showed the barrenness of their minds, and how
            superficial the cultivation must have been, which their understanding had
            received. 
         </p>
         <p><a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>, I know, has given a
            definition of genius, which would overturn my reasoning, if I were to admit
            it.—He imagines, that <span class="italics">a strong mind, accidentally
               led to some particular study</span> in which it excels, is a genius.<span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span>—Not to stop to investigate the causes which
            produced this happy <span class="italics">strength</span> of mind, experience
            seems to prove, that those minds have appeared most vigorous, that have pursued
            a study, after nature had discovered a bent; for it would be absurd to suppose,
            that a slight impres-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 171]</p><p class="pnoindent">sion made on the weak faculties of a boy, is
            the fiat of fate, and not to be effaced by any succeeding impression, or
            unexpected difficulty. <a href="people.html#JohnsonSamuel">Dr. Johnson</a>
            in fact, appears sometimes to be of the same opinion (how consistently I shall
            not now enquire), especially when he observes, "that <a href="people.html#ThomsonJames">Thomson</a> looked on nature with the
            eye which she only gives to a poet."<span class="sup"><a href="#4" id="back4"><sup>4</sup></a> </span></p>
         <p>But, though it should be allowed that books may produce some poets, I fear they
            will never be the poets who charm our cares to sleep, or extort admiration. They
            may diffuse taste, and polish the language; but I am inclined to conclude that
            they will seldom rouse the passions, or amend the heart. 
         </p>
         <p>And, to return to the first subject of discussion, the reason why most people are
            more interested by a scene describ-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 172]</p><p class="pnoindent">ed by a poet, than by a view of
            nature, probably arises from the want of a lively imagination. The poet
            contracts the prospect, and, selecting the most picturesque part in his <span class="italics">camera</span>, the judgment is directed, and the whole
            force of the languid faculty turned towards the objects which excited the most
            forcible emotions in the poet's heart; the reader consequently feels the
            enlivened description, though he was not able to receive a first impression from
            the operations of his own mind. 
         </p>
         <p>Besides, it may be further observed, that gross minds are only to be moved by
            forcible representations. To rouse the thoughtless, objects must be presented,
            calculated to produce tumultuous emotions; the unsubstantial, picturesque forms
            which a contemplative man gazes on, and often follows with </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 173]</p><p class="pnoindent">ardour
            till he is mocked by a glimpse of unattainable excellence, appear to them the
            light vapours of a dreaming enthusiast, who gives up the substance for the
            shadow. It is not within that they seek amusement; their eyes are seldom turned
            on themselves; consequently their emotions, though sometimes fervid, are always
            transient, and the nicer perceptions which distinguish the man of genuine taste,
            are not felt, or make such a slight impression as scarcely to excite any
            pleasurable sensations. Is it surprising then that they are often overlooked,
            even by those who are delighted by the same images concentrated by the poet?
         </p>
         <p>But even this numerous class is exceeded, by witlings, who, anxious to appear to
            have wit and taste, do not allow their understandings or feel-</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 174]</p><p class="pnoindent">ings
            any liberty; for, instead of cultivating their faculties and reflecting on their
            operations, they are busy collecting prejudices; and are predetermined to admire
            what the suffrage of time announces as excellent, not to store up a fund of
            amusement for themselves, but to enable them to talk. 
         </p>
         <p>These hints will assist the reader to trace some of the causes why the beauties
            of nature are not forcibly felt, when civilization, or rather luxury, has made
            considerable advances—those calm sensations are not sufficiently lively to
            serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary, or even to the moderate pursuer of
            artificial pleasures. In the present state of society, the understanding must
            bring back the feelings to nature, or the sensibility must have such native
            strength, as rather to be whetted than</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="pagenumber">[Page 175]</p><p class="pnoindent">destroyed by the strong
            exercises of passion. 
         </p>
         <p>That the most valuable things are liable to the greatest perversion, is however
            as trite as true:—for the same sensibility, or quickness of senses, which
            makes a man relish the tranquil scenes of nature, when sensation, rather than
            reason, imparts delight, frequently makes a libertine of him, by leading him to
            prefer the sensual tumult of love a little refined by sentiment, to the calm
            pleasures of affectionate friendship, in whose sober satisfactions, reason,
            mixing her tranquillizing convictions, whispers, that content, not happiness, is
            the reward of virtue in this world.
