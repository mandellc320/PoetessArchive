            					better chance of giving pleasure than of commanding respect. Books of this
            					description are condemned by the grave, and despised by the fastidious; but
            					their leaves are seldom found unopened, and they occupy the parlour and the
            					dressing-room while productions of higher name are often gathering dust upon
            the
            					shelf. It might not perhaps be difficult to show that this species of
            					composition is entitled to a higher rank than has been generally assigned it.
            					Fictitious adventures, in one form or other, have made a part of the polite
            					literature of every age and nation. These have been grafted upon the actions

         <p>Adorned with the embellishments of Poetry, they produce the epic; more
            					concentrated in the story, and exchanging narrative for action, they become
            					dramatic. When allied with some great moral end, as in the <span class="italics">Telemaque</span> of <a href="people.html#FenelonFrancois">Fenelon</a>, and <a href="people.html#Marmontel">Marmontel</a>'s <span class="italics">Belisaire</span>, they may be termed
            					didactic. They are often made the vehicles of satire, as in <a href="people.html#SwiftJonathan">Swift</a>'s <span class="italics">Gulliver's Travels</span>, and the
            						<span class="italics">Candide</span> and <span class="italics">Babouc</span> of <a href="people.html#Voltaire">Voltaire</a>. They take a tincture from the
            					learning and politics of the times, and are made use of successfully to attack
            					or recommend the prevailing systems of the day. When the range of this kind of
            					writing is so extensive, and its effect so great, it seems evident that it ought
            					to hold a respectable place among the productions of genius; nor is it easy to
            					say, why the poet, who deals in one kind of fiction, should have so high a place
            					allotted him in the temple of fame; and the romance-writer so low a one as in
            					the general estimation he is confined to. To measure the dignity of a writer
            by
            					the pleasure he affords his readers is not perhaps using an accurate criterion;
            					but the invention of a story, the choice of proper incidents, </p>

         <p>If we look for the origin of fictitious tales and adventures, we shall be obliged
            					to go to the earliest accounts of the literature of every age and country. The
            					Eastern nations have always been fond of this species of mental gratification.
            					The East is emphatically the country of invention. The Persians, Arabians, and
            					other nations in that vicinity have been, and still are, in the habit of
            					employing people whose business it is to compose and to relate entertaining
            					stories; and it is surprising how many stories (as <a href="people.html#ParnellThomas">Parnell</a>'s
            						Hermit for instance) which have passed current in verse and
            					prose through a variety of forms, may be traced up to this source. From Persia
            					the taste passed into the soft and luxurious Ionia. The <span class="italics">Milesian Tales</span>, written by <a href="people.html#Aristides">Aristides of Miletus</a>, at what time is

            					beat <a href="people.html#Crassus">Crassus</a><span class="sup"><a href="#3" id="back3"><sup>3</sup></a> </span> took occasion,

            					nation with effeminacy, in not being able, even in time of danger, to dispense
            					with such an amusement. From Ionia the taste of romances passed over to the
            					Greeks about the time of <a href="people.html#AlexandertheGreat">Alexander
               						the Great</a>. The <span class="italics">Golden Ass</span>

            					translation was given in 1789; and had this Selection admitted translations,
            it
            					would have found a place here. It is not so much read as it ought to be; and
            it
            					may not be amiss to inform the customers to circulating libraries, that they
            may
            					have the pleasure of reading a genuine novel, and at the same time enjoy the
            					satisfaction of knowing how people wrote in Greek about love, above a thousand
            					years ago. The scene of this work is chiefly laid in Egypt. It opens in a
            					striking and picturesque manner. A band of pirates, from a hill that overlooks
            					the Heracleotic mouth of the Nile, see a ship lying at anchor, deserted by its
            					crew; a feast spread on the shore; a number of dead bodies scattered round,
            					indicating a recent skirmish or quarrel at an entertainment: the only living
            					creatures, a most beautiful virgin seated on a rock, weeping over and supporting
            					a young man of an equally distinguished figure, who is wounded and apparently
            					lifeless. These are the hero and the heroine of the piece, and being thus let
            					into the middle of the story, the preceding events are given in narration. The
            					description of the manner of life of the pirates at the mouth of the Nile is
            					curious, and no doubt historical. It shows that, as well then as in <a href="people.html#Homer">Homer</a>'s time, piracy was looked upon

            					for his captives, and behaved well to his men, did not scruple to rank himself
            					with other military heroes. Indeed it might be difficult to say why he should
            					not. It is a circumstance worth observing, that <a href="people.html#TassoTorquato">Tasso</a> has in all probability
            					borrowed a striking circumstance from the Greek romance. <span class="italics">Chariclea</span> is the daughter of a queen of

            					of the queen, while pregnant, having gazed at a picture of <a href="people.html#Perseus">Perseus</a> and <a href="people.html#Andromeda">Andromeda</a>, her infant was born with a
            					fair complexion. This is the counterpart of the story of Clorinda, in the
            						Gierusalemme Liberata, whose mother is surprised with the
            					same phÃ¦nomenon, occasioned by having had in her chamber a picture of St.
            					George. The discovery is kept back to the end of the piece, and is managed in
            a
            					striking manner. There is much beautiful description, of which the pomp of
            					heathen sacrifices and processions makes a great part; and the love is at once
            					passionate and chaste.

            					greater splendour under the Gothic powers, and it sprung out of the histories
            of
            					the times, enlarged and exaggerated into fable. Indeed all fictions have
            					probably grown out of real adventures. The actions of heroes would be the most
            					natural subject for recital in a warlike age; a little flattery and a little
            					love of the marvellous would overstep the modesty of truth in the narration.
            A
            					champion of extraordinary size would be easily magnified into a giant. Tales
            of
            					magic and enchantment probably took their rise from the awe and wonder with
            					which the vulgar looked upon any instance of superior skill in mechanics or
            					medicine, or acquaintance with any of the hidden properties of nature. The
            					Arabian Tales, so well known and so delightful, bear testimony to this. At a
            					fair in Tartary a <span class="italics">magician</span> appears, who brings
            					various curiosities, the idea of which was probably suggested by inventions they
            					had heard of, which to people totally ignorant of the mechanical powers would
            					appear the effect of enchantment. </p>

            					magic in New Holland or Otaheite! Letters and figures were easily turned into
            					talismans by illiterate men, who saw that a great deal was effected by them,
            and
            					intelligence conveyed from place to place in a manner they could not account
            					for. Medicine has always, in rude ages and countries, been accompanied with
            					charms and superstitious practices, and the charming of serpents in the East
            is
            					still performed in a way which the Europeans cannot discover. The total
            					separation of scholastic characters from men of the world favoured the belief
            of
            					magic; and when to these causes are added the religious superstitions of the
            					times, we shall be able to account for much of the marvellous in the first
            					instance. These stories, as well as the historical ones, would be continually
            					embellished, as they passed from hand to hand, till the small mixture of truth
            					in them was scarcely discoverable.

            					writers. The Crusades kindled a taste for romantic adventure; the establishment
            					of the Saracens in Spain had occasioned a large importation of genii and
            					enchantments, and Moorish magnificence was grafted upon the tales of the Gothic
            					chivalry. Of these heroic romances, the Troubadours were in France the chief
            					composers: they began to flourish about the end of the tenth century. They by
            					degrees mingled a taste for gallantry and romantic love with the adventures of

            The

            					and in this, and in all her other works, she invariably represents as ending
            in
            					misery, every connexion which is begun by a mutual inclination. The parent, the

         <p>One Chinese novel has been translated. It is called <span class="italics">The Pleasing History, or the Adventures of Hau Kiou
               							Choan</span>. It is said to be much esteemed, but can only be
            					interesting to an European, as exhibiting something of the manners of that
            					remote and singular country. It chiefly turns upon the stratagems used by the
            					heroine to elude the ardour of her lover, and retard his approaches, till every
            					circumstance of form and ceremony had been complied with. In their most tender
            					assignations the lady is hid behind a curtain, as he is not permitted to see
            her
            					face; and a female attendant conveys the tender speeches from one to the other;
            					by which, according to our ideas, they would lose much of their pathos. The
            					chief quality the heroine exhibits is cunning, and the adventures are a kind
            of
            					hide-and-seek between the lovers. In short, <span class="italics">Shuy Ping

            					more poignant delight, but they are seldom enjoyed in perfection, and never
            					without expense and trouble. Poetry requires in the reader a certain elevation
            					of mind and a practised ear. It is seldom relished unless a taste be formed for

            					from pain or vexatious occurrences, to take man from himself, (at many seasons

            					events; and to distribute, like a ruling providence, rewards and punishments

         <p>It is sufficient therefore as an end, that these writings add to the innocent
            					pleasures of life; and if they do no harm, the entertainment they give is a
            					sufficient good. We cut down the tree that bears no fruit, but we ask nothing
            of
            					a flower beyond its scent and its colour. The unpardonable sin in a novel is
            					dullness: however grave or wise it may be, if its author possesses no powers
            of
            					amusing, he has no business to write novels; he should employ his pen in some
            					more serious part of literature.

            					since it is certain they have had a very strong effect in infusing principles
            					and moral feelings. It is impossible to deny that the most glowing and
            					impressive sentiments of virtue are to be found in many of these compositions,
            					and have been deeply imbibed by their youthful readers. They awaken a sense of
            					finer feelings than the commerce of ordinary life inspires. Many a young woman
            					has caught from such works as <span class="italics">Clarissa</span> or <span class="italics">Cecilia</span>, ideas of delicacy and refinement which
            					were not, perhaps, to be gained in any society she could have access to. Many
            a
            					maxim of prudence is laid up in the memory from these stores, ready to operate
            					when occasion offers.

         <p>The passion of love, the most seductive of all the passions, they certainly paint
            					too high, and represent its influence beyond what it will be found to be in real
            					life; but if they soften the heart they also refine it. They mix with the
            					natural passions of our nature all that is tender in virtuous affection; all
            					that is estimable in high principle and unshaken constancy; all that grace,
            					delicacy, and sentiment can bestow of touching and attractive. Benevolence and
            					sensibility to distress are almost always insisted on in modern works of this

            our

            					stories. A high regard to female honour, generosity, and a spirit of
            					self-sacrifice, are strongly inculcated. It costs nothing, it is true, to an
            					author to make his hero generous, and very often he is extravagantly so; still,
            					sentiments of this kind serve in some measure to counteract the spirit of the
            					world, where selfish considerations have always more than their due weight. In

         <p>Love is a passion particularly exaggerated in novels. It forms the chief interest
            					of, by far, the greater part of them. In order to increase this interest, a
            					false idea is given of the importance of the passion. It occupies the serious
            					hours of life; events all hinge upon it; every thing gives way to its influence,
            					and no length of time wears it out. When a young lady, having imbibed these
            					notions, comes into the world, she finds that this formidable passion acts a
            					very subordinate part on the great theatre of the world; that its vivid
            					sensations are mostly limited to a very early period; and that it is by no
            					means, as the poet sings,</p>

            					very small share in the transactions of the busy world, and is often little
            					consulted even in choosing a partner for life. In civilized life both men and
            					women acquire so early a command over their passions, that the strongest of them
            					are taught to give way to circumstances, and a moderate liking will appear
            					apathy itself, to one accustomed to see the passion painted in its most glowing
            					colours. Least of all will a course of novels prepare a young lady for the
            					neglect and tedium of life which she is perhaps doomed to encounter. If the
            					novels she reads are virtuous, she has learned how to arm herself with proper
            					reserve against the ardour of her lover; she has been instructed how to behave
            					with the utmost propriety when run away with, like <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#HarrietByron">Miss Byron</a></span>, or locked up by
            					a cruel parent, like <span class="italics"><a href="people.html#ClarissaHarlowe">Clarissa</a></span>; but she is not
            					prepared for indifference and neglect. Though young and beautiful, she may see
            					her youth and beauty pass away without conquests, and the monotony of her life
            					will be apt to appear more insipid when contrasted with scenes of perpetual
            					courtship and passion.

            					they can possibly be, they will in some respects give false ideas, from the very
            					nature of fictitious writing. Every such work is a <span class="italics">whole</span>, in which the fates and fortunes of the personages are brought
            					to a conclusion, agreeably to the author's own preconceived idea. Every
            					incident in a well written composition is introduced for a certain purpose, and
            					made to forward a certain plan. A sagacious reader is never disappointed in his
            					forebodings. If a prominent circumstance is presented to him, he lays hold on
            					it, and may be very sure it will introduce some striking event; and if a
            					character has strongly engaged his affections, he need not fear being obliged
            to
            					withdraw them: the personages never turn out differently from what their first
            					appearance gave him a right to expect; they gradually open, indeed; they may
            					surprise, but they never disappoint him. Even from the elegance of a name he
            may
            					give a guess at the amenity of the character. But real life is a kind of
            					chance-medley, consisting of many unconnected scenes. The great author of the
            					drama of life has not finished his piece; but the author must finish his; and
            					vice must be punished and virtue rewarded in the compass of a few vo- </p>

         <p>In short, the reader of a novel forms his expectations from what he supposes
            					passes in the mind of the author, and guesses rightly at his intentions, but
            					would often guess wrong if he were considering the real course of nature. It
            was

            					but the practised novel-reader knows well that no such event can await the hero

            					business it is pleasingly to interest his readers. He has no doubt but that,
            in

            					agreeable termination. He has no doubt but that his parents will be discovered

            					of things, but from what he has discovered of the author's intentions. But
            					what would have been the probability in real life? Why, that the parents would
            					either never have been found, or have proved to be persons of no

            					country gentleman with whom she would have lived in moderate happiness,
            					according to the usual routine of married life. But the author would have done

         <p>Though a great deal of trash is every season poured out upon the public from the
            					English presses, yet in general our novels are not vicious; the food has neither
            					flavour nor nourishment, but at least it is not poisoned. Our national taste
            and
            					habits are still turned towards domestic life and matrimonial happiness, and
            the
            					chief harm done by a circulating library is occasioned by the frivolity of its
            					furniture, and the loss of time incurred. Now and then a girl perhaps may be
            led
            					by them to elope with a coxcomb; or, if she is handsome, to expect the homage
            of
            					a <span class="italics">Sir Harry</span> or <span class="italics">My
               						lord</span>, instead of the plain tradesman suitable to her situation in life;
            					but she will not have her mind contaminated with such scenes and ideas as <a href="people.html#Crebillonfils">Crebillon</a>, <a href="people.html#LouvetdeCouvray">Louvet</a>, and others of that class
            					have published in France. 
         </p>
         <p>And indeed, notwithstanding the many paltry books of this kind published in the
            					course of every year, it may safely be affirmed that we have more good writers

            					of these are ladies: and surely it will not be said that either taste or morals

         <p>No small proportion of modern novels have been devoted to recommend, or to mark
            					with reprobation, those systems of philosophy or politics which have raised so

               						Ives</span> is of this number: its beauties, and beauties it certainly
            					has, do not make amends for its absurdities. What can be more absurd than to
            					represent a young lady gravely considering, in the disposal of her hand, how
            she
            					shall promote the greatest possible good of the system? Mr. <a href="people.html#HolcroftThomas">Holcroft</a> was a man of strong
            					powers, and his novels are by no means without merit, but his satire is often
            					partial, and his representations of life unfair. On the other side may be

            					and the novels of <a href="people.html#WestJane">Mrs. West</a>. In the war
