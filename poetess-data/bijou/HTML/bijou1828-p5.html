            <p>The few observations which are necessary to be prefixed to this volume, will contain
               little more than acknowledgements to the distinguished literary characters, and
               eminent artists whose respective productions adorn its pages; as it is on those
               productions the Publisher rests his hopes that it will be deemed entitled to an
               elevated station among the Annual publications, not of this country only, but of
               Europe.&nbsp; Far from wishing, however, to institute invidious comparisons, he only
               assets for it an equal claim to the notice and patronage of the public; for whether
               with respect to its graphic illustrations, or its literary merits, he feels assured
               that it will not be found inferior to any, even if it does not excel most, of its
               contemporaries.
            </p>
            <p>To describe the Editor's obligations to this various friends in adequate terms would
               require space infinitely beyond that to which a preface is necessarily limited; but
               in briefly expressing his gratitude to the celebrated characters who have cheerfully
               afforded him the assistance of their talents, he will not only perform a grateful
               duty, but at the same time tacitly urge the pretensions which he considers "THE
               BIJOU" to possess to public favor.

               the painter Mr. Wilkie, they have been able to enrich the Work.&nbsp; Nor is it too much
               to expect that if every other recommendation were wanting, that plate, and still more
               the description by which it is accompanied would prove irresistable attractions to
               the world; for who can be indifferent to so pleasing a memorial of a writer to whose
               merits England, Europe, nay, the whole civilized world, has offered its homage and
               its praise.&nbsp; Conspicuous as that letter is among the literary beauties of these
               sheets,—and to it may be attributed an interest as unfading as the reputation of its
               writer—almost all the popular authors of the day have contributed one or more

               It must not be supposed that his obligations are the less&nbsp; important to those whose
               names have just been mentioned; but where a favor has been conferred in a peculiar
               manner, it at least demands that it should be peculiarly acknowledged.&nbsp; Mr.
               Coleridge, in the most liberal manner, permitted the Editor to select what he pleased
               from all his unpublished MSS., and it will be seen from the “Wanderings of Cain,”
               though unfinished, and the other pieces bearing that Gentleman's name, that whenever
               he may favour the world with a perfect collection of his writings he will adduce new
               and powerful claims upon its respect.

            <p>In another, but no less important department of talent, the Proprietors have yet to
               pay their debt of gratitude.&nbsp; From the invaluable favours he has conferred upon the

               gratuitous use of his beautiful picture “The Oriental Love-Letter,” in the Council
               Room of the Royal Academy; and which derives considerable interest from the elegant
               illustration by which it is accompanied from the pen of his accomplished wife.&nbsp; To
               Mr. W. H. Worthington the Proprietors are grateful for the loan of his painting "The

               HALLORAN THE PEDLAR and the catastrophe described in a recent publication of deserved
               popularity, both evidently referring to the same historical fact, it is necessary,
               in
               order to prevent the suspicion of plagiarism, to state that the Tale of Halloran was
               written, and in the hands of the publisher, long previously to the appearance of the
               Novel where a similar circumstance is related.&nbsp; Many most valuable papers, nearly
               sufficient to form another volume, remain in the Editor's possession; for the obvious
               reason of superabundance of matter, it was impossible to insert them in the present

               attraction from the illustrious rank and eminent virtues of their authors:&nbsp; these

            <p>"A LITTLE further, O my father, yet a little farther, and we shall come into the open
               moonlight!" Their road was through a forest of fir- trees; at its entrance the trees
               stood at distances from each other, and the path was broad, and the moonlight, and
               the moonlight shadows reposed upon it, and appeared quietly to inhabit that solitude.
               But soon the path winded and became narrow; the sun at high noon sometimes speckled,
               but never illumined it, and now it was dark as a cavern.
            </p>
            <p>"It is dark, O my father!" said Enos, "but the path under our feet is mooth and soft,
               and we shall soon come out into the open moonlight. Ah, why dost thou groan so
               deeply?"
            </p>
            <p>"Lead on my child," said Cain, "guide me, little child." And the innocent little
               child clasped a finger of the hand which had murdered the righteous Abel, and he
               guided his father. "The fir branches drip upon thee my son." — "Yea, pleasantly,

               that feed on these fir trees! they leap from bough to bough, and the old squirrels
               play round their young ones in the nest. I clomb a tree yesterday at noon, O my
               father, that I might play with them, but they leapt away from the branches, even to
               the slender twigs did they leap, and in amoment I beheld them on antoher tree. Why,
               O
               my fahter, would they not play with me? Is it because we are not so happy as they?
               Is
               it because I groan sometimes even as thou groanest?" Then Cain stopped and stifling
               his groans, he sank to the earth, and the child Enos stood in the darkness beside
               him; and Cain lifted up his voice, and cried bitterly, and said, "The Mighty One that
               persecuteth me is on this side and on that; he pursueth my soul like the wind, like
               the sand- blast he passeth through me; he is around me even as the air, O that I
               might be utterly no more! I desire to die — yea, the things that never had life,
               neither move they upon the earth — behold they seem precious to mine eyes. O that
               a
               man might live without the breath of his nostrils, so I might abide in darkness and
               blackness, and an empty space! Yea, I would lie down, I would not rise, neither would
               I stir my limbs till I became as the rock in the den of the lion, on which the young
               lion resteth his head whilst he sleepeth. For the torrent that roareth far off hath
               a

               a
               little way from the place where I found the cake and the pitcher;" and Cain said,
               "How knowest thou?" and the child answered — "Behold, the bare rocks are a few of
               they strides distant from the forest; and while even now thou wert lifting up thy
               voice, I heard the echo." Then the child took hold of his father, as if he would
               raise him, and Cain being faint and feeble rose slowly on his knees and pressed
               himself against the trunk of a fir, and stood upright and followed the child. The
               path was dark till within three strides' length of its termination when it turned
               suddenly; the thick black trees formed a low arch, and the moonlight appeared for
               a
               moment like a dazzling portal. Enos ran before and stood in the open air; and when
               Cain, his father, emerged from the darkness the child was affrighted, for the mighty
               limbs of Cain were wasted as by fire; his hair was black, and matted into loathly
               curls, and his countenance was dark and wild, and told in a strange and terrible
               language of agonies that had been, and were, and were still to continue to be.

               snow that would have been lovely, fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands.
               Never morning lark had poised himself over this desert; but the huge serpent often
               hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture, and the vulture screamed, his wings
               imprisoned within the coilds of the serpent. The pointed and shattered summits of
               the
               ridges of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns, and seemed to prophecy
               mutely of things that then were not; steeples, and battlements, and ships with naked
               masts. As far from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook, there was
               one
               rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge. It had been precipitated
               there perhaps by the terrible groan the earth gave when our first father fell. Before
               you approached, it appeared to lie flat on the ground, but its base slanted from its
               point, and between its points and the sands a tall man might stand upright. It was
               here that Enos had found the pitcher and cake, and to this place he led his father.
               But ere they arrived there they beheld a human shape; his back was towards them, and
               they were coming up unperceived when they heard him smite his breast and cry aloud,
               "Wo, is me! wo, is me! I must never die again, and yet I am perishing with thirst
               and
               hunger."

               exceedingly. The voice was sweet indeed, but it was thin and querulous like that of
               a
               feeble slave in misery, who despairs altogether, yet can not refrain himself from
               weeping and lamentation. Enos crept softly round the base of the rock, and stood
               before the stranger, and looked up into his face. And the Shape shrieked, and turned
               round, and Cain beheld him, that his limbs and his face were those of his brother
               Abel whom he had killed; and Cain stood like one who struggles in his sleep because
               of the exceeding terribleness of a dream; and ere he had recovered himself from the
               tumult of his agitation, the Shape fell at this feet, and embraced his knees, and
               cried out with a bitter outcry, "Thou eldest born of Adam, whom Eve, my mother,
               brought forth, cease to torment me! I was feeding my flocks in green pastures by the
               side of quiet rivers, and thou killedst me; and now I am in misery." Then Cain closed
               his eyes, and hid them with his hands — and again he opened his eyes, and looked
               around him, and said to Enos "What beholdest thou? Didst thou hear a voice, my son?"
               "Yes, my father, I beheld a man in unclean garments, and he uttered a sweet voice,
               full of lamentation." Then Cain raised up the shape that was like Abel, and said,

               beneath their feet; and he shrieked yet a third time, and threw himself on his face
               upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the rock, and Cain and Enos sate
               beside him; the child by his right hand, and Cain by his left. They were all three
               under the rock, and within the shadow. The Shape that was like Abel raised himself
               up, and spake to the child; "I know where the cold , waters are, but I may not drink,
               wherefore didst thou then take away my pitcher?" but Cain said, "Didst thou not find
               favour in the sight of the Lord thy god?" The Shape answered, "The Lord is God of
               the
               living only, the dead have another god." Then the child Enos lifted up his eyes and
               prayed; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart. "Wretched shall they be all the days
               of their mortal life," exclaimed the Shape, "who sacrifice worthy and acceptable
               sacrifices to the God of the dead; but after death their toil ceaseth. Woe is me,
               for
               I was well beloved by the God of the living, and cruel wert thou, O my brother, who
               didst snatch me away from his power and his dominion." Having uttered these words,
               he
               rose suddenly, and fled over the sands, and Cain said in his heart, "The curse of
               the
               lords is on me — but who is the God of the dead?" and he ran after the shape, and

               child told him that he had caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and that the
               man had fallen upon the ground; and Cain once more sat beside him, and said — "Abel,
               my brother, I would lament for thee, but that the spirit within me is withered, and
               burnt up with extreme agony. Now, I pray thee, by thy flocks and by thy pastures,
               and
               by the quiet rivers which thou lovest, that thou tell me all that thou knowest. Who
               is the God of the dead? where doth he make his dwelling? what sacrifices are
               acceptable unto him? for I have offered, but have not been received; I have prayed,
               and have not been heard; and how can I be afflicted more than I already am?" The
               Shape arose and answered — "O that thou hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on
               thee. Follow me, son of Adam! and bring thy child with thee:" and they three passed
               over the white sands between the rocks, silent as their shadows.

               AT ABBOTSFORD BY DAVID WILKIE, ESQ. R. A., AND EXHIBITED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY IN

            </p><br></br><p>MY DEAR ADAM — The picture you mention has something in it of rather a domestic
               character, as the personages are represented in a sort of masquerade, such being the
               pleasure of the accomplished painter. Nevertheless, if you, the proprietor, incline
               to have it engraved, I do not see that I am entitled to make any objection.
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. * * * mentions besides, a desire to have anecdotes of my private and domestic
               life, or, as he expresses himslef, a portrait of the author in his nightgown and
               slippers; — and this form you, who, I dare say, could furnish some anecdotes of our
               younger days which might now seem ludicrous enough. Even as to my night gown and
               slippers, I believe the time has been when the articles of my wardrobe were as
               familiar to your memory as Poins's </p>

               that period has been for some years past, and I cannot think it would be interesting
               to the public to learn that I had changed my old robe-de-chambre for a handsome
               douillette, when I was last at Paris.
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, that a man of ordinary sense cannot be supposed delighted with the
               species of gossip which, in the dearth of other news, recurs to such a quiet
               individual as myself; and though, like a well-behaved lion of twenty years standing,
               I am not inclined to vex myself about what I cannot help, I will not, in any case
               in
               which I can prevent it, be acessary to these follies. There is no man known at all
               in
               literature who may not have more to tell of his private life than I have: I have
               surmounted no difficulties either of birth or education, nor have I been favored by
               any particular advantages, and my life has been as void of incidents of importance,
               as that of the "weary knife-grinder."

            <p>The follies of youth ought long since to have passed away; and if the prejudices and
               absurdities of age have come in their place, I will keep them, as Beau Tibbs did his
               prospect, for the amusement of my domestic friends. A mere enumeration of the persons

               very painful recollections.
            </p>
            <p>The idea which our inimitable Wilkie adopted ws to represent our family group in the
               garb of south-country peasants, supposed to be concerting a merry-making, for which
               some of the preparations are seen. The place is the terrace near Kayside, commanding
               an extensive view toward the Eildon-hills. 1. The sitting figure, in the dress of
               a
               miller, I believe, represents Sir Walter Scott, author of a few scores of volumes,
               and proprietor of Abbotsford, in the County of Roxburgh. 2. In front, and presenting,
               we may suppose, a country wag somewhat addicted to poaching, stands sir Adam
               Ferguson, Knight, Keeper of the Regalia of Scotland. 3. In the background is a very
               handsome old man, upwards of eighty-four years old at the time, painted in his own
               character of a shepherd. He also belonged to numerous clan of Scott. He used to claim
               credit for three things unusual among the southland shepherds: first, that he had
               never been fou in the course of his life; secondly, that he never had struck a man
               in
               anger; thirdly, that though entrusted with the the management of large sales of
               stock, he had never lost a penny for his master by a bad debt. He died soon aterwards
               at Abbotsford. 4, 5, 6. Of the three female figures </p>

               most forward in the group is Miss Sophia Charlotte Scott, now Mrs. John Gibson
               Lockhart; and 6, her younger sister, Miss ann Scott. Both are represented as
               ewe-milkers, with their leglins, or milk-pails. 7. On the left hand of the shepherd,
               the young man holding a fowling-piece is the eldest son of Sir Walter, now Captain
               in
               King's Hussars. 8. The boy is the youngest of the family, Charles Scott, now of
               Brazen Nose College, Oxford. The two dogs were distinguished favorites of the family;
               the large one was a stag-hound of the old Highland breed, called Maida, and one of
               the hansomest dogs that could be found; it was a present to me from the chief of
               Glengary, and was highly valued, both on account of his beauty, his fidelity, and
               the
               great rarity of the breed. The other is little Highland terrier, called
               <em>Ourisk</em> (goblin), of a particualr kind, bred in Kintail. It was a
               present from the honorable Mrs. Stuart Mackenzie, and is a valuable specimen of race
               which is now also scarce. Maida, like Bran, Lerath, and other dogs of distinction,
               slumbers "beneath his stone," distinguished by an epitaph, which to the honour of
               Scottish scholarship be it spoken, has only one false quantity in two lines.

            <p>Ourisk still survives, but like some other personages in the picture, with talents
               and temper rather the worse for wear. She has become what Dr. Rutty, the Quaker,
               records himself in his journal as having sometimes been — sinfully dogged and
               snappish.

               heartily welcome to them, but I make it my especial bargain that nothing more is said
               upon such a meagre subject.
            </p>
            <p>It strikes me, however, that there is a story about old Thomas Scott, the shepherd,
               which is characteristic, and which I will make your friend welcome to. Tom was, both
               as a trusted servant, and as a rich fellow in his line, a person of considerable
               importance among his class in the neighbourhood, and used to stickle a good deal to
               keep his place in public opinion. Now, he suffered, in his own idea at least, from
               the consequence assumed by a country neighbour, who, though neither so well reputed
               for wealth or sagacity as Thomas Scott, had yet an advantage over him, from having
               seen the late King, and used to take precedence upon all occasions when they chanced
               to meet. Thomas suffered under this superiority. But after this sketch was finished,
               and exhibited in London, the newspapers made it known that his present majesty had
               condescended to take some notice of it. Delighted with the circumstance, Thomas Scott
               set out on a most oppressively hot day, to walk five miles to Bowden, </p>

            <header>From the Spanish of
               Don Juan Algalaba
            </header>
            <p class="stage">[The battle of Montiel was that which determined the fate of Pedro the Cruel. Just
               ten years before it took place he and Edward the Black Prince had utterly defeated
               at Nejara Henry (called of Transtamara) Pedro's natural brother, the competitor
               for the throne of Castile: But in the interval Pedro's cruelties had alienated the
               affection of his subjects, and the murder of his wife Blanche of Bourbon, sister
               to the King of France, had stirred up an enemy whom, being deserted by the English
               Prince, he had no longer any sufficient means to resist.
            </p>
            <p class="stage">Pedro's famous mistress, Maria de Padilla, was in the castle of Montiel when the
               battle was fought, and after her lover was slain received the body and was
               permitted to bury it.
            </p>
            <p class="stage">The French army was commanded by the illustrous Bertrand du Guesclin — in whose
               memoirs the highly picturesque details of the conflict, the subsequent meeting of
               the brothers, and the death of Pedro, may be found. Le Begue was the French knight
               who stabbed Pedro.]

            <p>ABOUT the centre of a deep winding and woody lane, in the secluded village of
               Aberleigh, stands an old farm-house, whose stables, out-buildings, and ample yard,
               have a peculiarly forlorn and deserted appearance; they can, in fact, scarcely be
               said to be occupied, the person who rents the land preferring to live at a large farm
               about a mile distant, leaving this lonely house to the care of a labourer and his
               wife, who reside in one end, and have the charge of a few colts and heifers that run
               in the orchard and an adjoining meadow, whilst the vacant rooms are tenanted by a
               widow in humble circumstances and her young family.
            </p>
            <p>The house is beautifully situated; deep, as I have said, in a narrow woody lane,
               which winds between high banks, now feathered with hazel, now thickly studded with
               pollards and forest trees, until opposite Kibe's farm it widens sufficiently to admit
               a large clear pond, round which the hedge, closely and regularly set with a row of
               tall elms, sweeps in a graceful curve, forming for that bright mirror, a rich leafy

               widens, and makes an abrupter winding, as it is crossed by a broad shallow stream,
               a
               branch of the Loddon, which comes meandering along from a chain of beautiful meadows;
               then turns in a narrower channel by the side of the road, and finally spreads itself
               into a large piece of water, almost a lakelet, amidst the rushes and the willows of
               Hartley Moor. A foot-bridge is flung over the stream, where it crosses the lane,
               which, with a giant oak growing on the bank, and throwing its broad branches far on
               the opposite side, forms in every season a pretty rural picture.
            </p>
            <p>Kibe's farm is as picturesque as its situation; very old, very irregular, with gable
               ends, clustered chimneys, casement windows, a large porch, and a sort of square wing
               jutting out even with the porch, and covered with a luxuriant vine, which has quite
               the effect, especially when seen by moonlight, of an ivy-mantled tower. One side
               extends the ample but disused farm buildings; on the other the old orchard, whose
               trees are so wild, so hoary and so huge, as to convey the idea of a fruit forest.
               Behind the house is an ample kitchen-garden, and before a neat flower court, the
               exclusive demesne of Mrs. Lucas and family, to whom indeed the labourer, John Miles,
               and his good wife Dinah, served in some sort as domestics.

               Peninsular war, leaving her with three children, one lovely boy and two delicate
               girls, to struggle through the world as best she might. She was an accomplished
               woman, and at first, settled in great town, and endeavoured to improve her small
               income by teaching music and languages. But she was country bred; her children too
               had been born in the country, amidst the sweetest recesses of the New Forest, and
               pining herself for liberty, and solitude, and green fields, and fresh air, she soon
               began to fancy that her children were visibly deteriorating in health and appearance
               and pining for them also; and finding that her old servant Dinah Miles was settled
               with her husband in this deserted farm-house, she applied to his master to rent for
               a

            <p>We lived in different parishes, and she declined company, so that I seldom met Mrs.

               recollection of the mild, placid, elegant mother, surrounded by three rosy, romping
               bright-eyed children, when the arrival of an intimate friend at Aberleigh rectory
               caused me frequently to pass the lonely farm-house, and threw this interesting family

               the hedge, and the sweet scent of the bean fields perfuming the air. Mrs. Lucas,
               still lovely and elegant, though somewhat faded and careworn, was walking pensively
               up and down the grass path of the pretty flower court; her eldest daughter, a rosy
               bright brunette, with her dark hair floating in all directions, was darting about
               like bird; now tying up the pinks, now watering the geraniums, now collecting the
               fallen rose leaves into the straw bonnet which dangled from her arm; and now feeding
               a brood of bantams from a little barley measure, which that sagacious and active
               colony seemed to recognise as if by instinct, coming long before she called them at
               their swiftest pace, between a run and a fly, to await with their usual noisy and
               bustling patience the showers of grain which she flung to them across the paling.
               It
               was a beautiful picture of youth, and health, and happiness; and her clear gay voice,
               and brilliant smile, accorded well with a shape and motion as light as a butterfly,
               and as wild as the wind. A beautiful picture was that rosy lass of fifteen in her
               unconscious loveliness, and I might have continued gazing on her longer, had I not
               been attracted by an object no less charming, although in a very different way.

               sun floating around her like a glory, and displaying the singular beauty of her
               chesnut hair, brown with a golden light, and the exceeding delicacy of ther smooth
               and finely grained complexion, so pale, and yet so healthful. Her whole face and form
               had a bending and statue-like grace, encreased by the adjustment of her splendid
               hair, which was parted on her white forehead, and gathered up behind in a large knot
               — a natural coronet. Her eyebrows and long eyelashes were a few shades darker than
               her hair, and singularly rich and beautiful. She was plaiting straw rapidly and
               skilfully, and bent over her work with a mild and placid attention, a sedate
               pensiveness that did not belong to her age, and which contrasted strangely and sadly
               with the gaiety of her laughing and brilliant sister, who at this moment darted up
               to
               her with a handful of pinks and some groundsel. Jessy received them with a smile —
               such a smile! — spoke a few sweet words in a sweet sighing voice; put the flowers
               in
               her bosom, and the groundsel in the cage of a linnet that hung near her; and then

               of the individual. We soon became acquainted, and even intimate under the benign
               auspices of the kind mistress of the rectory; and every interview served to encrease
               the interest excited by the whole family, and most of all by the sweet blind

               soon perceived from a different source. Her blindness had been of recent occurrence,
               arising from inflammation unskilfully treated, and was pronounced incurable; but from
               coming on so lately, it admitted of several alleviations, of which she was accustomed
               to speak with a devout and tender gratitude. "She could work," she said, "as well
               as

               some day or other she would shew me, only that it seemed so vain, some verses which
               her dear brother William had written upon a groupe of wild flowers, which she had
               begun before her misfortune. Oh, it was almost worth while to be blind to be the
               subject of such verse, and the object of such affection! Her dear mamma was very good
               to her, and so was Emma; but William — oh she wished that I knew William! No one
               could be so kind as he! It was impossible! He read to her; he talked to her; he
               walked with her; he taught her to feel confidence in walking alone; he had made for
               her use the wooden steps up the high bank which led into Kibe's meadow; he had put
               the hand-rail on the old bridge, so that now she could get across without danger,
               even when the brook was flooded. He had tamed her linnet; he had constructed the
               wooden frame, by the aid of which she could write so comfortable and evenly; could
               write letters to him, and say her own self all that she felt of love and gratitude.
               And that," she continued with a deep sigh, "was her chief comfort now; for William
               was gone, and they should never meet again — never alive — that she was sure of —
               she
               knew it." "But why, Jessy?" "Oh, because William was so much too good for this world:
               there was nobody like William! And he was gone for a soldier. Old General Lucas, her
               father's uncle, had sent for him abroad; </p>

               never meet again — of that she was sure — she knew it."
            </p>
            <p>This persuasion was evidently the master-grief of poor Jessy's life, the cause that
               far more than her blindness faded her cheek, and saddened her spirit. How it had
               arisen no one knew; partly, perhaps, from some lurking superstition, some idle word,
               or idler omen which had taken root in her mind, nourished by the calamity which in
               other respects she bore so calmly, but which left her so often in darkness and
               loneliness to brood over her own gloomy forebodings; partly from her trembling
               sensibility, and partly from the delicacy of frame and of habit which had always
               characterised the object of her love — a slender youth, whose ardent spirit was but
               too apt to overtask his body.
            </p>
            <p>However it found admittance, there the presentiment was, hanging like a dark cloud
               over the sunshine of Jessy's young life. Reasoning was useless. They know little of
               the passions who seek to argue with that most intractable of them all, the fear that
               is born of love; so Mrs. Lucas and Emma tried to amuse away those sad thoughts,
               trusting to time, to William's letters, and above all, to William's return to
               eradicate the evil.

               of
               Jessy Lucas. William spoke of improved health, of increased strength, of actual
               promotion, and expected recal. At last he even announced his return under auspices
               the most gratifying to his mother, and the most beneficial to her family. The
               regiment was ordered home, and the old and wealthy relation, under whose protection
               he had already risen so rapidly, had expressed his intention to accompany him to
               Kibe's farm, to be introduced to his nephew's widow and daughters, especially Jessy,
               for whom he expressed himself greatly interested. A letter from General Lucas
               himself, which arrived by the same post, was still more explicit: it adduced the
               son's admirable character and exemplary conduct as reasons for befriending the
               mother, and avowed his design of providing for each of his young relatives, and of
               making William his heir.

               the
               peril of a Winter voyage (for it was deep January) crossed her imagination, and
               checked her joy. At length, long before they were expected, another epistle arrived,
               dated Portsmouth. They had sailed by the next vessel to that which conveyed their
               previous dispatches, and might be expected hourly at Kibe's farm. The voyage was

               taken from Jessy's heart. She raised her sweet face and smiled; yet still it was a
               fearful and a trembling joy, and somewhat of fear was mingled even with the very
               intensity of her hope. It had been a time of rain and wind; and the Loddon, the
               beautiful Loddon, always so affluent of water, had overflowed its boundaries, and
               swelled the smaller streams which it fed into torrents. The brook which crossed
               Kibe's lane had washed away part of the foot-bridge, destroying poor William's
               railing, and was still foaming and dashing like a cataract. Now that was the nearest
               way; and if William should insist on coming that way! To be sure, the carriage road
               was round by Grazely Green, but to cross the brook would save half a mile; and
               William, dear William, would never think of danger to get to those whom he loved.
               These were Jessy's thoughts: the fear seemed impossible, for no postillion would
               think of breasting that roaring stream; but the fond sister's heart was fluttering
               like a new caught bird, and she feared she knew not what.
            </p>
            <p>All day she paced the little court, and stopped and listened, and listened and
               stopped. About sunset, with the nice sense of sound which seemed to come with her
               fearful calamity, and that fine sense, quickened by anxiety, expectation, and love,
               she heard, she thought she heard, she was sure she heard the sound of a carriage

               is only the noise of the rushing waters," cried Emma. "I hear a carriage, the horses,
               the wheels!" replied Jessy; and darted off at once, with the double purpose of
               meeting William, and of warning the postillion of crossing the stream. Emma and her
               mother followed, fast! fast! But what speed could vie with Jessy's, when the object
               was William? They called, but she neither heard nor answered. Before they had to won
               to the bend in the lane she had reached the brook; and, long before either of her
               pursuers had gained the bridge, her foot had slipt from the wet and tottering plank,
               and she was borne resistlessly down the stream. Assistance was immediately procured;
               men, and ropes, and boats; for the sweet blind girl was beloved of all, and many a
               poor man perilled his life in a fruitless endeavor to save Jessy Lucas; and William,
               too, was there, for Jessy's quickened sense had not deceived her. William was there,
               struggling with all the strength of love and agony to rescue that dear and helpless
               creature; but every effort — although he persevered until he too was taken out
               senseless — every effort was vain. The fair corse was recovered, but life was
               extinct. Poor Jessy's prediction was verified to the letter; and the brother and his
               favourite sister never met again.

                  Sicilly, with so much violence, that in about two minutes the vessel went down,
                  and every soul on board, but one, perished. This man saved himself on a piece of
                  timber, which floated to a rock called the Hellweathers, where he was compelled to
                  remain some days before he could receive any assistance. Besides the Association,
                  the Eagle, of 70, and the Romney, of 50 guns, perished, with all their crews. The
                  Firebrand, fireship, was also lost, but most of her men were saved. Many persons
                  of rank, and about 2000 seamen perished on this occasion. <span class="">DREW'S HISTORY OF CORNWALL</span>.]

               Leonora, "had I not been afoot with the lark to gather May- dew before the sun had
               drank the moisture from these flowers, thou mightest have gone bootless home again,
               for my lady the countess, and Victorine and Eugenie still press their pillows:
               dreaming perchance of thy master and his gallant esquire; dost think boy, that
               sallow-visaged melancholy baron, sighing after the wreck of the fortune which he
               lacks the wit to mend, or the doughty hero, Roland, who would fain prompt him, if
               his
               dull brain could compass the matter, to some dexterous shift or stirring enterprise;
               or those goodly trencher men, Dugarde and Montresor, are like to haunt a lady's
               slumbers?"

               may
               please the fancy of thy lady and her maids to dream about; the place is solitary thou

               again."

               I'll carry that away which to possess thou wouldst give — aye, the lovelock Roland

               a secret, Leonora."

               quickly; come, thou art a sprightly lad, and wilt make a better knight than thy
               master."

               lady, or I'm gone."

            <p>"Thou shalt have an eyas, one that the master falconer engages shall prove a tarsel
               gentle; I'll broider thee thy glove myself, and its jesses shall be of silver:
               methinks thou only wantest a bird upon thy fist to brave it with the best."

               in which the silly hearts of thy fair companions so much delight, are the grand
               attraction with his needy followers. I dare not hint that Roland is drawn hither by

               she shewed the boy out of a little postern gate, and charged him to be faithful.
               Flying round to the mew, where, as he was wont, Bertram de Lille was stationed
               overlooking the falconers and whistling to the hawks, Leonora seized the youth by

               impatient spirit expected to see the dust which the charger's hoofs would raise upon
               the adjacent hill; and exchanging his travel-soiled garments for the silken vest

            </p>
            <p>THE great hall in the royal castle of Linz resounded with kettle-drums and trumpets,
               while King Ferdinand and his Queen sat at the banquet table, rejoicing that the siege
               was now raised, and Austria once more victorious. The banquet was given in honour
               of
               the young Baron von Reichenstein, who then, for the first time, appeared as the
               King's guest. He had the good fortune to bring the welcome tidings that Solyman,
               after beleaguering the city for many weeks, and being repulsed in every attack, had
               at last suddenly desisted from his undertaking, and retreated by quick marches. Of
               the distinction now conferred on Reichenstein his own noble conduct during the siege
               rendered him eminently worthy, nor could the favour have been bestowed on any one
               who
               would have valued it more highly, for pride and ambition were indeed his leading
               characteristics.

            <p>The lively monarch banished for the time all political cares, and gave himself up
               to
               the festivity of the moment, heightened by the consideration that the good news came
               unexpectedly, as Vienna was then, in truth, but ill provided with the means of
               defence, and the Sultan, at the head of three thousand men, had vowed never to return
               till he had conquered both Hungary and Austria, where the Christian sway should be
               terminated for ever. Merrily coursed the brimming goblets round the table, and in
               the
               joy of his heart the King proposed the health of his country's brave defender, the
               heroic youth, Philip Palsgraf of the Rhine, and of the veteran warrior, Count
               Nicholas of Salm, whose locks had now grown grey under arms. The mirth became louder,
               and the applause more vehement, till the Queen commanded silence and attention, for
               she too had prepared a little entertainment to celebrate the termination of that
               campaign which had threatened so much misfortune; well knowing that on such occasions
               her illustrious consort did not disdain to exchange the homage to Bacchus for a
               sacrifice to the Muses. Of this Monarch, indeed, it is recorded that when a certain
               Colonel of his Life Guards once ventured to hint that he bestowed too many favors
               on
               the learned, to the neglect of the ancient nobility, the Colonel next day received
               a
               great packet of old and important parchments, with an order that he </p>

               abstract of their contents; the Colonel, of course, brought them back, declaring his
               incapacity for the task. "Good friend," said the King, smiling ironically, "you will
               for the future spare your animadversions on our patronage of the learned, for you
               perceive that if noblemen and warriors only were to be raised to office, the duties
               of the state would be fulfilled yet worse than heretofore."
            </p>
            <p>On a signal from the queen a red silk curtain at the bottom of the hall was suddenly
               drawn up, and revealed an altar from which a clear flame rose flickering, and
               illuminated the arms of Austria wreathed with laurel and gorgeously emblazoned.
               Before the altar sat a female form, beaming in such luxuriance of beauty, that she
               might well indeed have been deemed one of the muses descended from Mount Olympus.
               Her
               long white robes though rich in folds could not conceal the exquisite symmetry of
               her
               form; round her waist she wore a gold embroidered girdle, while from her shoulders
               waved a short mantle of blue velvet studded with golden stars. Her features were of
               the noblest Grecian mould; round her temples was bound a laurel wreath, and her
               glossy chesnut hair flowed in profuse curls round her blushing cheeks, down into her
               snow-white neck and bosom. In her arms she supported a harp, and accompanying her

               praise of the brave men by whose courage the threatening danger had been averted,
               and
               the proud plans of the Pagan invader defeated. Impassioned eloquence or music alone
               is enough to move irresistibly every feeling heart, — but how much is that effect
               encreased , when the tones flow from lips so beautiful, when such eyes beam with the
               sacred fire of inspiration! — A watchful silence prevailed in the hall that was
               before so loud with voices; the guests had eyes and ears only for the seraphic
               musician, who exercised her power like an enchantress even over the roughest veteran
               warriors "albeit unused to the melting mood," for she recalled to them and presented
               as if in a magic mirror the fairy dreams of their youth. How vivid then must have
               been the impression on younger auditors! Involuntarily all hearts were attracted and
               won by the lovely performer — every eye glistened with pleasure, and when she had
               finished her triumphant song, every tongue was busy in her praise — even the proud
               and haughty Baron Reichenstein was deeply moved. 'Till now, the attention which had
               often been bestowed on the young warrior by susceptible beauties of the capital had
               failed to excite any other sensation but that of gratified vanity. Now, however, when
               the songstress in her chaunt alluded to him as the announcing messenger of that that
               victory which he had assisted to gain, he could </p>

               humbly fixed on the ground.

            <p>So the festivities of the banquet were closed, and the evening of that happy day was
               spent in dancing and games of chance. For neither of these amusements was Baron
               Reichenstein disposed. Leaning against a pillar of the Gothic Hall, he followed with
               watchful eyes every movement of the Demoiselle Appollonia von Santi, — for so the
               beautiful songstress was named. Descended from a noble Greek house, and left in early
               youth an orphan, she had been brought to the Court of King Ferdinand, and there
               educated as one of the queen's maids of honour. Her beauty, — her eminent talents
               for
               music, and but still more the unpretending modesty of her demeanour excited universal
               attention, and every one spoke with respect of the beautiful Lady Appollonia. No
               sooner had she made her appearance in the ball-room than Reichenstein saw that the
               young and old crowded around her, to express their thanks for the delight which her
               music had afforded, and afterwards as she whirled past him in the walk, supported
               by
               some gay and brilliant courtier, he was racked by a feeling of the bitterest envy;

               dance, his eyes often encountered hers, and when she seated herself for refreshment
               and rest, her looks again followed him as if she would say — "And you alone
               determined not to share in the pleasures of these fleeting hours?" So at last he
               mustered resolution, humbly approached the victorious enchantress, and in a
               faultering half audible voice begged that he might have the honour of her hand for
               the next dance. Appollonia blushed and courtesied her consent; the warlike hero made
               an awkward bow, and retreated, not daring to say more, 'till the music recommencing
               called them to their places. Reichenstein, who was usually a good waltzer could now
               scarcely keep in time, while his lovely partner seemed to partake of his
               embarrassment, yet this was but for a few minutes; her sparkling eyes and approving
               smiles soon roused him to self-possession. Even the musicians seemed inspired; they
               played louder, and with more precision. Envied by many a youth in the numerous

               all the while by the approbation which he read unequivocally in the bright eyes of
               his auditress. Appollonia's attention was indeed so absorbed that she forgot the
               dance, and the presence of the court, so that the marshal was obliged to remind her
               of her duty, for the queen had already proposed to break up the party.
            </p>
            <p>Henceforward Reichenstein saw the young lady almost every day, and continued always
               to discover new charms and fresh virtues, — and this at length drew from him a
               confession of his love, and a request for her hand in marriage. Appollonia in answer
               explained to him that her fate depended on the king, who had hitherto acted towards
               her as a father, and who therefore possessed the full parental authority.
               Reichenstein heard this with fear and trembling; for he suspected that Ferdinand
               might have other views for his fair adopted daughter. He knew how much the king
               delighted in Appollonia's talents, by which his mind was often exhilarated after the
               cares of public business, and with which amusement it could not be supposed that he
               would willingly dispense. It was necessary therefore to watch for some favourable
               opportunity, when the king should appear in especial good humour, before the subject
               could be broached, and ere long, such a fitting occasion presented itself to the
               anxious lover.

               happened to lose by an accidental fire great part of the national archives, and their
               most important charters or deed of immunity. Conscience-stricken, and fearful that
               advantage might be taken of this event, whereby they might be deprived of many
               valuable privileges, they sent a deputation to Linz, in order to treat with their
               monarch on the subject. Scarcely had Ferdinand heard their preamble, when he
               exclaimed angrily — "Your charters may be destroyed, but our imperial promise, and
               principles of integrity, are not destroyed along with them. All the rights and
               privileges of which this fire has robbed you, we shall renew; and, where there is
               doubt, rather than give you less, we shall make your advantages greater than before."
               Of that scene Reichenstein was a witness. "No," said he to himself, "it is impossible
               that a sovereign, who is thus so mild and equitable, should be harsh to me alone."
               And no sooner had the ashamed representatives left the audience-hall, than he threw
               himself at Ferdinand's feet, and stammered out his request. For a few moments he was,
               indeed, kept in agonising suspense, while the king looked at him silently and with
               a
               very grave aspect. At length he made a sign for the supplicant to rise, and said,

               marriage was solemnized with princely magnificence, and Reichenstein took his young
               bride to the family castle from which he derived his title, and which was situated

               Upper Austria, in one of the most attractive districts of that beautiful country.
               Then, from far and near, flocked visitors to pay their homage at the festal mansion,
               more attracted, however, by the wondrous musical talents of the bride, than by the
               hospitable manners of the castle's lord. The young noblemen of the neighbourhood,

               the Lady von Reichenstein's improvisator songs was beyond measure fervent. The

               soon yielded to another very different emotion. He began to fear that it was not

               irritability as much as possible, though many times, by gloomy silence, or short
               monosyllabic answers, did he betray his inward discontent. Appollonia, conscious of
               her own innocence, was completely at a loss to fix on any cause for this change, and
               enquired anxiously the reason of his distress, — whereupon the proud baron, instead

               that haunted his house, was either moodily silent as before, or ascribed his

               far too fatiguing, she begged him to dismiss their guests, in order that they might

               the idea of having appeared as a jealous husband? He insisted that the castle of his
               ancestors must remain open to every guest; and when Appollonia, under various

               Michael Oglu, who was forcing his way with the van of the Turkish army over the
               Sommering mountains. In the heat of battle the Baron had advanced too far; he was

               consequence of his severe wounds, had obtained permission to return home, and had
               taken with him to his own country all his prisoners. "So then he lives — he is at

               vassals would deeply grieve for her absence, she would not long defer her return.

            <p>Meanwhile, the Ritter von Reichenstein was obliged to fulfil menial drudgery as a
               slave in the gardens of Ibrahim, Bassa of Belgrade. At that time it happened that
               in
               his Harem there prevailed great affliction; Fatima, the most beautiful and beloved
               of
               his wives, had been driven to distraction by the death of her first-born infant
               child, and the violence of her sorrow had given way to an apathy and indifference
               which amounted to insanity. The unhappy Ibrahim offered the largest rewards for
               assistance, and tired every method to save his favourite from that untimely death
               to
               which the continuance of her malady would certainly lead. The most skilful physicians
               had recourse to all expedients of their art, but in vain; so that with an almost
               broken heart, Ibrahim saw that she was rapidly sinking into the grave.

            <p>One evening when he was under the dominion of these painful reflections, it was
               announced that a Grecian youth had made his appearance at Belgrade as a harp player
               and singer, with whose music every listener had been enraptured, and who had begged
               permission to prove his talents before the Bassa. Ibrahim gladly availed himself of
               the opportunity to obtain some diversion from his own gloomy thoughts; he desired
               that the stranger should be admitted forthwith, and was so much delighted with the
               youth's performance that as long as the music continued he quite forgot his usual
               sufferings. Thereafter the question occurred to him whether that magic art which had
               such influence over his emotions might not also alleviate the malady of his beloved
               Fatima. He imparted this idea to the stranger, who encouraged his hopes, and assured
               him that many instances were on record of insane persons being altogether restored
               to
               health by the power of music. "Should'st thou succeed in this attempt," cried the
               rejoiced Bassa, "then demand what thou wilt — no reward is too great, when the
               service performed is the preservation of my dearest Fatima."

            <p>The Greek youth was duly instructed in the cause and symptoms of the malady, and
               undertook its cure. The attempt succeeded even beyond expectation. At first he was

               time Fatima seemed, as usual, indifferent, but by degrees her attention was roused,
               and she listened with visibly increasing interest. While the music continued, her
               beautiful features were once more animated, a slight tinge of colour rose into her
               cheeks, and a lambent fire shone in her eyes, but as the tones died away into silence
               she declined again into her wonted mournful apathy. By degrees she began to watch

               several successive days, and as often as the hour drew near which was appointed for
               the musician's attendance, she expressed anxiety and impatience; nay, once when by
               some accident he had been detained, she enquired if they intended to deprive her of
               her only remaining consolation. These words were the first that she had been heard

               utter for many weeks, and from henceforward the Greek, at her request, came earlier,
               and remained longer. By degrees, too, he ventured to introduce songs that were less
               mournful, and the listener seemed even more gratified than before, till at length
               she
               begged to see the wonderful musician by whom she had been thus delighted; and even

            <p>The Bassa, rejoiced beyond measure at this result, did not fail to send for the
               musician. "Thou hast fulfilled thy promise," said he, "now demand thy reward, in
               order that I also may behave honourably. Be not afraid to ask too much, for Allah
               has
               made me rich by his exceeding bounties, but for the preservation of my best and
               dearest treasure I am indebted to thee." "Sir," answered the youth, "there is in the
               gardens of your Harem a noble German soldier, the Ritter von Reichenstein, a captive
               who now labours there as a slave. It so happens that I have been deeply indebted to
               his house, and therefore if you are pleased to give up to me the liberty of this man,
               I shall be amply and richly rewarded." "Take him hence then," said the Bassa, "and
               along with him, if thou wilt, ten of his fellow soldiers, who have hitherto shared
               his fate. Moreover, it shall not be said that the Bassa Ibrahim sent any man out into
               the wide world to find his way home as a mendicant; he shall therefore be amply
               provided for; and thou, too, modest youth, shalt not leave my palace unrewarded."

               exiles threw themselves at their deliverer's feet, even kissed the hem of his
               garment, and wept in their excess of gratitude. "Be thankful to God," said the youth,

            <p>The Bassa's promises were faithfully fulfilled. Enriched by valuable presents, and
               attended by a secure escort, Reichenstein, along with his companions, left Belgrade.
               They arrived in safety at the Christian camp, and were all most kindly received by
               King Ferdinand, especially Reichenstein, who still expressed his wish and resolution
               to remain with the army. "In the first place," answered the King, "it is our will
               and
               pleasure that you should appear before her Majesty at Linz. Should your inclinations
               alter when there, which I hope may be the case, you shall have free leave of absence
               from your military duties, for after the oppressions you have undergone, this
               indulgence is but just and necessary. If however your determination should remain
               unshaken, the presence of so brave a soldier as the Baron von Reichenstein will

               his wonted pride, had hidden his face in the folds of her garment. Appollonia would
               have raised him up, but he exclaimed vehemently, though in a voice broken by his
               emotion — "Never more dare I lift up mine eyes to her whom I have thus injured! No
               penance no humiliation can atone for that guilt which now </p>

               effaced."
            </p>
            <p>"Nay," said Appollonia, "knowst thou not that of all duties in this world, there is
               none more easy for true love than to forgive, — that the fond heart may indeed be
               wounded and broken by faults, mistrust and injuries, yet will never thus be alienated
               from its idol?"
            </p>
            <p>So the happy couple rushed into each others embrace, forgetful of the spectators and
               all the world — nor was there one individual present, who did not sympathize in their
               emotion; even the queen herself burst into tears. Henceforward, Reichenstein
               cherished no other pride but that founded on possession of the most beautiful and
               faithful of wives. The Bassa of Belgrade's gifts might increase his worldly wealth,
               but not his happiness, for in the tried attachment of Appollonia, he had secured the
               richest of all earthly treasures; mutually placing unbounded confidences in each
               other, their path of life was evermore cheered by sunshine and strown with
               flowers.

            <p>IT is hardly necessary to remind the reader that at the close of the Peninsular war
               orders were issued for the formation of an encampment in the neighbourhood of
               Bourdeaux, where the regiments which had been selected to reinforce Sir George
               Prevost in Canada, as well as to carry on hostilities along the shores of the United
               States, might assemble. It fell to the lot of the **** regiment of light infantry
               to
               form one of the corps appointed for the last-mentioned of these services. Having been
               attached to the left column of Lord Wellington's army we were stationed, when the
               above intelligence reached us, under the walls of Bayonne, at the distance of ten
               long day's march from the point of rendezvous; but we welcomed the communication with
               not less alacrity on that account, and </p>

            <p>Of the particulars of our journey I am not at present called upon to give any
               account, farther than that in all its stages, and in every circumstance connected
               with it, it was most delightful. The weather chanced to be peculiarly favorable. Not
               a shower of rain, or a blast of wind, overtook us during the whole of our progress;
               and though towards noon the heat usually became more oppressive than agreeable, we
               managed by starting every day an hour or two before sun-rise, to escape most of the
               inconveniences which might have otherwise affected us. Every thing moreover, animate
               and inanimate which came in our way, had about it an air of exquisite novelty. The
               costume and personal appearance of the people, the arrangement of their houses,
               fields, vineyards and gardens, the order of their domestic life, were to us perfectly
               new, and interesting. We struck into the Landes, on the morning of the third day,
               and
               if any of my readers have happened to visit that wild district, he will doubtless
               attest that one more singular, or more prolific in extraordinary spectacles, has
               seldom been pressed by the foot of a traveller [sic].

            <p>Amidst the huge forests of pine which overspread the whole face of this region, there
               are scattered at wide intervals from one another, a few villages, or rather hamlets,

               most part, of from ten to twenty cottages, the walls of which are composed entirely
               of wood, and the roofs uniformly covered with straw. Each stands apart in the centre
               of its own neat garden and enclosure, whilst to the distance of perhaps a quarter
               of
               a mile in every direction, a circle of cultivated fields encompasses the whole. It
               rarely happens that a stream of limpid and excellent water is wanting in the
               vicinity, and a church, suited to the humble charactor [sic] of its simple
               worshippers, was a conspicuous feature in every one of the hamlets that lay along
               the
               line of our march.
            </p>
            <p>The quarter-master-general had so arranged our route that we were every day enabled,
               after compassng [sic] a sufficient extent of ground, to encamp in the neighbourhood
               of one or other of these delightful villages. The inhabitants proved in all
               instances, as obliging, as their poverty and secluded course of existence authorised
               us to expect; and if the women were not always remarkable for personal beauty they
               were, at all events, invariably goodnatured [sic], and lively. It happened that on
               one occasion I had my feelings wrought upon to a degree beyond my anticipations; and
               as the affair appeared at the moment worthy of being noted down, perhaps even now
               it
               may be deemed not undeserving of mention.

            <p>The night of Saturday the 21st of May, having been spent in the village of St. Muret,
               at two o'clock on Sunday morning, our tents were struck and we were in motion. Our
               route lat, as usual during the preceding week over a deep sandy track, cut through
               the heart of a dreary pine-wood, and our journey, on account of the absence of a
               convenient spot for halting, proved to be particularly tedious and fatiguing. We had
               traversed something more than six leagues; the hour of noon was past, and the heat
               had become intense, when a sort of shout uttered at the head of the column gave
               notice, that a resting place was in view. The shout did not deceive us. The leading
               files had already emerged from the wood into the customary range of open country;
               and
               in little more than half an hour afterwards our camp was pitched in one [sic] the
               loveliest situations which it had occupied since the commencement of our
               progress.

            <p>Unlike its fellow-hamlets, La Barbp the village, beside which we now halted did not
               stand in the midst of an extensive area of bare meadows, and low corn-fields. Meadows
               and corn-fields there doubtless were but their surfaces were beautifully diversified
               by the frequent interspersion of clumps of oaks and chesnuts [sic]; whilst numerous
               undulations in the ground produced a species of tasteful irregularity, which gave

               different farms. A rivulet of the purest water issued from the forest upon the right,
               and flowing gently onwards, wound round the base of a green hill, upon which, about
               a
               stone's throw apart from the other buildings, was erected the village church. In the
               village itself I saw nothing to distinguish it from the others. It consisted as usual
               of wooden cottages, not one of which, in point of architecture or decorations could
               claim a superiority over the others. And even the very cure or vicarage, if such it
               deserved to be called, was nothing more than a cabin, clean and neat, indeed, but
               presenting the lowliest aspect.

            <p>Every body [sic] knows, that Sunday is observed in a French village as a day, not
               of
               relaxation only, but of jubilee. We therefore found the villagers in their best
               attire, assembled on the green or common, round which their cottages stood; and as
               they came forward in a body to bid us welcome, they presented upon the whole, a very
               striking and picturesque appearance. The men were conspicuous for their jackets of
               coarse brown cloth, their grey or brown breeches, blue stockings and large wooden
               shoes, but it was in the garb of the women that the distinction paid to Sunday might

               handkerchief tied round the head with more than ordinary care and neatness, gave
               intimation that the toilette for that day always occupied much time, and particular
               attention. All, however, seemed to enjoy the same excellent flow of spirits, and not
               a few of the younger had gladly availed themselves of our band, to continue the
               dancing which our approach had interrupted.

            <p>As soon as the bustle of encamping came to a close, I directed my steps towards the
               church, with the design of joining in the devotions of these simple people, or at
               least, of offering up my own orisons, from within consecrated walls. In this,
               however, I was disappointed; the priest, it appeared, officiated at another village
               besides La Barbp, taking the one in the morning, and the other in the evening,
               alternately; and as on this day, divine service had been performed here in the
               morning, it would not be repeated. Though a little chagrined at this circumstance
               I
               nevertheless followed up my original design so far, as to take a hasty survey of the
               interior of the pile; and then proceeded to indulge a favourite whim, by strolling

               head-stones or columns to tell the names of the persons who slept beneath. Wooden
               crosses seemed to be the only species of monument erected by the people of La Barbp
               to the memory of their deceased relatives, and of these, though they were almost as
               numerous as the graves themselves, not one bore a word or letter of inscription. Even
               the garlands, which throughout most parts of France it is customary for the survivors
               to twine over the tombs of those whom they loved, were all, with a solitary
               exception, wanting here. Upon one cross, and one only, hung a wreath of flowers; and
               though the blackened hue of the wood told a tale of exposure to more than one summer
               and winter, the garland was fresh and fragrant, as if gathered and arranged this very

               vent to fancy, when the noise of approaching footsteps disturbed my reverie. I looked

               agriculture; whereas my habits and tastes were all quiet and domestic. I cultivated
               my father's fields, contentedly and cheerfully, and was never so happy, as when I
               found leisure to dress Marie's garden, and stock it with the rarest and choicest
               plants within my reach. Yet for all this, she rejected my addresses: she withdrew
               not, indeed, from my society, but she refused to listen to my vows, and her refusal
               was so mildly and so affectionately pronounced that I only loved her the more because
               I felt my suit was hopeless. The truth is, Monsieur, that her affections were already
               engaged. She preferred to me, (who was continually at her side,) him who bestowed

               a small portion of his time or attention upon her; but spent whole days, and

               Gendarmerie, bearing an order from the prefect of the department, to enrol [sic] four
               young men from the division of La Barbp, for the service of the army. Such an order,

               the villagers capable of bearing arms, were put into a cap, and that of Lewis
               Charmont came up. Lewis himself, naturally brave and enterprising, uttered no
               complaint against his fortune, but rather rejoiced, in the prospect of honor and
               advancement. Lewis continued as yet ignorant of the possession of Marie's affections,
               for though repeatedly urged, she had hitherto refused to acknowledge it, though now,
               however, concealment was at an end. A threatening separation effected that which
               years of intimacy and familiar intercourse had failed to effect; and in the
               bitterness of her agony she yielded a full confession. I was present when she assured
               him, that she lived for him and him alone; that his departure would be to her a blow
               which she could not survive; that she would not even desire to exist, did he abandon
               her. What could I do. I saw indeed that my own hopes were blighted, and that Marie's

               recollection of the moment when the flushed cheek, and glittering eye I told her that
               her lover was free, and that they might thenceforth be happy together. Ah! Monsieur,
               that was indeed a moment of rapture, of rapture such as I shall never again
               experience when I heard her address me as her brother and preserver; when I felt her
               arms around my neck, and her warm tears upon my cheek, and received the sweetest and
               most rapturous kiss that the lip of woman ever bestowed! Oh! whole years of agony
               could not suffice to blot out the recollection of those moments; a life of pain were
               but a poor price to offer for their repossession! But they passed away; and I marched

               proof that the sacrifice which I had made had been to no purpose. A second call for
               recruits, it appeared, produced a second ballot; and the name of Lewis, as if heaven
               had decreed that he should not elude his destiny, was again among the number of the
               drawn. You may well believe that my friend for some time after his enlistment was
               melancholy enough, when I inform you that the very day was named which ought to have
               made Marie his own; yet he recovered his spirits by degrees, applied steadily to his

               just as it had taken its ground, and begun to make preparations for the siege of
               Rosas. You are, doubtless, aware, that the defence made by the garrison of that

               also; and I resolved that he should never again earn a distinction to which I should
               not be equally entitled; nor was I without hope that even Rosas might be to me, as
               it
               had been to him, a theatre of renown. The citadel still held out, principally, I
               believe, through the exertions of your countryman, Lord Cochrane, and a few of his
               sailors; and it continued for many days to withstand all our efforts. I was one of

               acquainted with the different tracks, he took him for his guide. The man was no
               traitor. He conducted the column, by a difficult and circuitous route, round the hill
               upon which Hostalrech is built, and brought it in safety, after a perilous and
               fatiguing march, once more into the high road.

               went on without beholding an enemy; but about four o'clock in the afternoon we
               suddenly found ourselves watched by a very superior force; which, in spite of our

               us, they could not even spare reinforcements to bring us off, for the defile of
               Trientepasos was before them, which must be passed that night or never; there was,

               not ignorant that he who became a prisoner to the Spaniards was less to be envied
               than his comrade who fell in battle. Though they exceeded us in numbers by four to

               escape, each man as he was best able, and we were not very scrupulous as to the
               means. We ran as fast as weariness would permit, preserving, however, for a time an
               irregular line, and stopping occasionally, as a convenient space offered, to check
               the pursuit by our fire; but at last even our skirmishing order was lost, and we fled

               had
               struck him just where the shoulder joins the neck, and passed into his vitals. My

               we had not proceeded a dozen paces before he exclaimed in a feeble voice, 'It is
               useless, Baptiste, I cannot proceed farther. Go, go you, save yourself for poor
               Marie, and leave me to die.' I could not act thus, Monsieur; it was not in my nature
               to abandon any one, more especially the friend of my heart, under these
               circumstances; so partly carrying, and partly dragging, I contrived to hurry him
               along, till a cottage opportunely offering, I conveyed him into it. It was deserted

               comforts, and but a very partial shelter. I laid him upon the mud floor, and tearing
               my handkerchief into shreds, attempted to staunch the blood which welled from his
               broken limb; but all my efforts were fruitless, it flowed in spite of them. When I
               looked at his countenance, too, that told me plainly enough that there was no hope;

               buried my face in my hands, and wept aloud. The sound of my lamentation reached him
               even in his last moments; he looked up, and in a tone scarcely audible, exclaimed,
               'Do not weep, Baptiste, do not weep, it must be thus, we must all die. Tell Marie
               that I fell as became me; and give her my medal, that she may occasionally look upon
               it, and remember me when I am gone. Tell her, likewise, that with my last breath I
               consigned her to you; you love her, Baptiste, that I know; and I need not add be kind
               to her, for to whom was my friend ever unkind? May you be happy together, and the

               to
               say, that his spirit would look down upon our happiness with delight, but the word
               died upon his lips, the lips themselves ceased to move, and he was a corpse.

               all expectation, had permitted us to thread it unmolested; and I partook of the
               bivouac which they had formed on the plain of Llenas. But our repose was of short
               continuance; the dawn had just begun to break when a heavy column showed itself in
               full march towards the pass; no doubt could exist as to the force which composed the
               column; so the drums beat to arms, and in five minutes after the army was in

               shot struck me in the left arm, and took it off. I was carried from the field along
               with hundreds besides, and having suffered amputation, was removed to a crowded
               hospital, where, during many weeks I endured all the misery attendant upon inadequate

               Poor Marie had received no account of her lover since he departed, and had pined and
               languished after him, like a bird robbed of her young. Her health, naturally
               delicate, was already impaired by suspense; how then could it be expected that she
               would bear up against the terrible reality; she did not, Monsieur. I broke the matter
               to her as delicately as I could, but even thus she was unable to bear it; the
               intelligence that Lewis was no more came upon her like a thunderbolt upon a bruised
               reed *** it crushed her. When I strove to cheer her by making mention of her lover's
               valour, her tears only flowed the faster; and when I pulled out his medal, and gave
               it to her as his last bequest, it seemed as if her heart would have broken. She took
               it, laid it upon her bosom, and to her dying day kept it there; nay, it was not

            <p>AS soon as I heard your daughter Tullia was dead, I confess I was extremely
               concerned, as it became me to be, at a loss which I regarded as common to us both;
               and if I had been with you, I should not have been wanting to you, but should have
               openly testified the bitterness of my grief. 'Tis true this is but a poor and
               miserable consolation, because those who ought to administer it, I mean our nearest
               friends and relations, are almost equally affected with ourselves, nor can they
               attempt it without shedding many a tear: so that they appear to be more in want of
               comfort themselves than to perform that duty to others. I resolved, however, to set
               down in a short letter to you such considerations as occurred to my mind, not because
               they can have escaped you, but because I think that your grief has hindered your
               attending to them. What reason is there why you should be transported by so
               immoderate a grief: consider how fortune has </p>

               more so to suffer and undergo what we now do. Give me leave to relate to you, what
               on
               a certain occasion afforded me some little comfort, and allow me to hope that it may
               have the same effect upon you. Upon my return from Asia, as I sailed from Ægina to
               Megara, on my right hand Piræus, on my left Corinth. These cities were at one time
               flourishing beyond imagination, but are now desolate and in ruins. Thus I began to
               ruminate with myself; alas! do we poor mortals resent it so much, if one of us dies,
               or is killed, whose life is of so short a date, when we see in one spot the many
               carcases [sic] of so great cities lying before us? Will you not, Servius, check your
               grief by recollecting that you are born a man? Believe me I was not a little
               comforted by that thought. If you please, therefore, try the power of it on yourself.
               It was but lately we saw many famous men perish, a great empire declining and all
               the
               provinces in the utmost distress. And shall the death of one little woman so
               grievously afflict you! Who if she had not died now, must in a few years have done

               had been married to youths of the greatest distinction; had enjoyed all manner of
               happiness: and fell at last with the republic. Upon what account can you or she
               complain of fortune? Above all, do not forget that you are Cicero, one who is
               accustomed to advise and direct others; and do not imitate bad physicians, who in
               the
               disorders of others profess that they are conversant in the art of physic, and are
               not able to cure themselves; but rather follow what you recommend to others and keep

               you any more concerning this affair lest I should appear to distrust your prudence.
               Wherefore, when I have mentioned this one piece of advice, I will conclude my letter.
               We have seen you bear prosperity in a manner that became you, and acquire great glory
               from it; now let us perceive that you can bear adversity with equal fortitude, and

               because those comforts are wanting which were not wanting to these, whom I have
               proposed to myself as patterns. For both Q. Maximus, who lost his son after he had
               been consul, and rendered himself famous by great actions; and L. Paulus, who was
               deprived of two sons in the compass of seven days, as well as your Gallus and Marcus;
               Cato who left a son of the greatest genius and virtue, all these lived at a time when
               their own dignity, which they had received at the hands of the republic, was alone
               able to alleviate their grief. But after I had lost those ornaments which you have
               mentioned, and which I had with much labour obtained, this was the only comfort left
               me, which I am now deprived of.

            <p>My thoughts were not employed on the affairs of friends, or in the affairs of the
               republic. It was irksome to me to do any thing in the Forum, and I could not even
               bear the sight of the Senate House. I thought what was very true, that I had lost
               all
               the fruits of my industry and fortune. Yet when I reflected that these things were
               common to me with you and many others; and when I was forcing myself to bear these
               things tolerably, I had a person to whom I could fly, with whom I could be at east,

               consolation under my private misfortunes to the prosperity of the republic. Therefore

               now receive, than in your conversation and friendship; and I hope, and indeed have

               to the will of one man, who is prudent and liberal, a great friend as I conceive of
               yours, and no enemy of mine. Still it demands no small deliberation what measures
               we

            <p>"IT grieves me," said an eminent poet once to me, "it grieves and humbles me to
               reflect how much our moral nature is in the power of circumstances. Our best
               faculties would remain unknown even to ourselves did not the influences of external
               excitement call them forth like animalculæ, which lie torpid till wakened into life
               by the transient sunbeam."
            </p>
            <p>This is generally true. How many walk through the beaten paths of every day life,
               who
               but for the novelist's page would never weep or wonder; and who would know nothing
               of
               the passions but as they are represented in some tragedy or stage piece? not that
               they are incapable of high resolve and energy; but because the finer qualities have
               never been called forth by imperious circumstances; for while the wheels of existence
               roll smoothly along, the soul will continue to slumber in her vehicle like a lazy
               traveller. </p>

               own parish, and they were married. Reilly was able, skilful, and industrious;
               Cathleen was the best spinner in the county, and had constant sale for her work at
               Kilkenny: they wanted nothing; and for the first year, as Cathleen said, "There

               of "<em>the drop</em>" was the beginning of all their misfortunes. In an evil
               hour he went to the Fair of Kilkenny to sell a dozen hanks of yarn of his wife's
               spinning, and a fat pig, the produce of which was to pay half a year's rent, and add
               to their little comforts. Here he met with a jovial companion, who took him into a
               booth, and treated him to sundry potations of whiskey; and while in his company, his
               pocket was picked of the money he had just received, and something more; in short,
               of
               all he possessed in the world. At that luckless moment, while maddened by his loss
               and heated with liquor, he fell into the company of a recruiting serjeant [sic]. The

               thousand times better than himself) poor Reilly sent a friend to inform Cathleen of

               a
               letter would await her at the Kilkenny post-office: the same friend was commissioned
               to deliver her his silver watch, and a guinea out of his bounty-money. Poor Cathleen
               turned from the gold with horror, as the price of her husband's blood, and vowed that
               nothing on earth should induce her to touch it. She was not a good calculator of time
               and distance, and therefore rather surprised that so long a time must elapse before
               his letter arrived. On the appointed day she was too impatient to wait the arrival
               of
               the carrier, but set off to Kilkenny herself, a distance of ten miles: there, at the
               post-office, she duly found the promised letter; but it was not till she had it in
               her possession that she remembered she could not read: she had therefore to hasten
               back to consult her friend Nancy, the schoolmaster's daughter, and the best scholar
               in the village. Reilly's letter, on being deciphered with some difficulty even by
               the
               learned Nancy, was found to contain much of sorrow, much of repentance, and yet more

            <p>It was summer, about the end of June: the days were long, the weather fine, and some
               gentle showers rendered travelling easy and pleasant. Cathleen walked on stoutly
               towards Cork, and by the evening she had accomplished with occasional pauses of rest,
               nearly twenty-one miles. She lodged at a little inn by the road side, and the
               following day set forward again, but soon felt stiff with the travel of two previous
               days: the sun became hotter, the ways dustier; and she could not with all her
               endeavours get farther than Kathery, eighteen miles from Cork. The next day
               unfortunately for poor Cathleen, proved hotter and more fatiguing than the preceding.
               The cross road lay over a wild country, consisting of low bogs and bare hills. About
               noon she turned aside to a rivulet bordered by a few trees, and sitting down in the
               shade, she bathed her swollen feet in the stream and overcome by heat, weakness, and
               excessive weariness she put her little bundle under her head for a pillow and sunk
               into a deep sleep.
            </p>
            <p>On waking she perceived with dismay that the sun was declining: and on looking about,
               her fears were increased by the discovery that her bundle was gone. Her first thought
               was that the good people, (i.e. </p>

               the
               work of no unearthly marauder. Bitterly reproaching herself for her carelessness,
               she
               again set forward; and still hoping to reach Cork that night, she toiled on and on
               with increasing difficulty and distress, till as the evening closed her spirits
               failed, she became faint, foot-sore and hungry, not having tasted any thing since
               the
               morning but a cold potatoe and a draught of buttermilk. She then looked round her
               in
               hopes of discovering some habitation, but there was none in sight except a lofty
               castle on a distant hill, which raising its proud turrets from amidst the plantation
               which surrounded it, glimmered faintly through the gathering gloom, and held out no
               temptation for the poor wanderer to turn in there and rest. In her despair she sat
               down on a bank by the road side, and wept as she thought of her husband.

               no
               farther notice of her than by a passing look; while they went on their way like the
               priest and the Levite in the parable, poor Cathleen dropped her head despairingly
               on
               her bosom. A faintness and torpor seemed to be stealing like a dark cloud over her
               senses, when the fast approaching sound of footsteps roused her attention, and

            <p>Halloran had been known for thirty years past in all the towns and villages between
               Waterford and Kerry. He was very old, he himself did not know his own age; he only
               remembered that he was a "tall slip of a boy" when he was one of the — — regiment
               of
               foot, and fought in America in 1778. His dress was strange, it consisted of a woollen
               cap, beneath which strayed a few white hairs, this was surmounted by an old military
               cocked hat, adorned with a few fragments of tarnished gold lace: a frieze great coat
               with the sleeves dangling behind, was fastened at his throat, and served to protect
               his box of wares which was slung at his back; and he always carried a thick oak stick
               or <em>kippeen</em> in his hand. There was nothing of the infirmity of age in his
               appearance: his cheek though wrinkled and weather-beaten was still ruddy: his step
               still firm, his eyes still bright; his jovial disposition made him a welcome guest
               in
               every cottage, and his jokes, though not equal to my Lord Norbury's, were repeated
               and applauded through the whole country. Halloran was lreturning [sic] from the fair
               of Kilkenny, where apparently his commercial speculations had been attended with
               success, as his pack was considerably diminished in size. Though he did not appear

            <p>After about half an hour's walking, they came to two crossways, diverging from the
               high road: down one of these the Pedlar turned, and in a few minutes they came in
               sight of a lonely house, situated at a little distance from the way-side. Above the
               door was a long stick projecting from the wall, at the end of which dangled a truss
               of straw, signifying that within there was entertainment (good or bad) for man and
               beast. By this time it was nearly dark, and the pedlar going up to the door, lifted
               the latch, expecting it to yield to his hand; but it was fastened within: he then
               knocked and called, but there was no answer. The building which was many times larger
               than an ordinary cabin had once been a manufactory, and afterwards a farm-house. One
               end of it was deserted, and nearly in ruins; the other end bore signs of having been
               at least recently inhabited. But such a dull hollow echo rung through the edifice
               at
               every knock, that it seemed the whole place was now deserted.

               the premises, led her round to the back part of the house, where there were some
               ruined out-buildings, and another low entrance. Here, raising his stout stick, he
               let
               fall such a heavy thump on the door that it cracked again; and a shrill voice from
               the other side demanded who was there? After a satisfactory answer, the door was
               slowly and cautiously opened, and the figure of a wrinkled, half famished and half
               naked beldam appeared, shading a rush candle with one hand. Halloran, who was of a
               fiery and hasty temper, began angrily: "Why, then, in the name of the great devil
               himself, didn't you open to us?" But he stopped suddenly, as if struck with surprise

               much; for, giving it back hastily, he supported Cathleen into the kitchen, the old
               woman leading the way, and placed her on an old settle, the first seat which

               on
               the table; and Cathleen, who was yet more faint from hunger than subdued by fatigue,
               was first helped by the good-natured Pedlar to the best of what was there: but, just
               as she was about to taste the food set before her, she chanced to see the eyes of
               the
               old woman fixed upon the morsel in her hand with such an envious and famished look,
               that from a sudden impulse of benevolent feeling, she instantly held it out to her.
               The woman started, drew back her extended hand, and gazed at her wildly.
            </p>
            <p>"What is it then ails ye?" said Cathleen, looking at her with wonder; then to
               herself, "hunger's turned the wits of her, poor soul! Take it — take it, mother,"
               added she aloud: "eat, good mother; sure there's plenty for us all, and to spare,"
               and she pressed it upon her with all the kindness of her nature. The old woman
               eagerly seized it.

            <p>While they were eating, the two Hogans, father and son, came in. They had been
               setting snares for rabbits and game on the neighbouring hills; and evidently were
               both startled and displeased to find the house occupied; which, since Barny Hogan's
               disgrace with "my lord," had been entirely shunned by the people round about. The
               old
               man gave the pedlar a sulky welcome. The son, with a muttered curse, went and took
               his seat in the chimney, where, turning his back, he set himself to chop a billet
               of
               wood. The father was a lean stooping figure, "bony, and gaunt, and grim:" he was
               either deaf, or affected deafness. The son was a short, brawny, thickset man, with
               features not naturally ugly, but rendered worse than ugly by an expression of louring
               ferocity disgustingly blended with a sort of stupid drunken leer, the effect of
               habitual intoxication.

            <p>Halloran stared at them awhile with visible astonishment and indignation, but pity
               and sorrow for a change so lamentable, smothered the old man's wrath; and as the
               eatables were by this time demolished, he took from his side pocket a tin flask of
               whiskey, calling to the old woman to boil some water "screeching hot," that he might
               make what he termed "a jug of stiff punch — enough to make a cat spake." He offered
               to share it with his hosts, who did not decline drinking; </p>

               with travelling, and, besides, disliking spirits, would not taste it. The old Pedlar,
               reconciled to his old acquaintances by this shew of good fellowship, began to grow
               merry under the influence of his whiskey-punch: he boasted of his late success in
               trade, shewed with exultation his almost empty pack, and taking out the only two
               handkerchiefs left in it, threw one to Cathleen, and the other to the old woman of
               the house; then slapping his pocket in which a quantity of loose money was heard to
               jingle, he swore he would treat Cathleen to a good breakfast next morning; and threw
               a shilling on the table, desiring the old woman would provide "stirabout for a
               dozen," and have it ready by the first light.

               concealing her apprehensions under an affectation of extreme fatigue and drowsiness,
               she desired to be shewn where she would sleep. The old woman lighted a lanthorn, and
               led the way up some broken steps into a sort of loft, where she shewed her two beds

               in
               an Irish cabin, where the inmates are usually lodged after a very promiscuous
               fashion; our readers, therefore, will not wonder at the arrangement. Cathleen,
               however, required that, if possible some kind of skreen [sic] should be placed
               between the beds. The old hag at first replied to this request with the most
               disgusting impudence; but Cathleen insisting, the beds were moved asunder, leaving
               a
               space of about two feet between them; and after a long search a piece of old frieze
               was dragged out from among some rubbish, and hung up to the low rafters, so as to
               form a curtain or partition half way across the room. Having completed this
               arrangement, and wished her "a sweet sleep and a sound, and lucky dreams," the old
               woman put the lanthorn on the floor, for there was neither chair nor table, and left
               her guest to repose.

            <p>Catheleen said her prayers, only partly undressed herself, and lifting up the worn
               out coverlet, lay down upon the bed. In a quarter of an hour afterwards the Pedlar
               staggered into the room, and as he passed the foot of her bed, bid God bless her,
               in
               a low voice. He then threw himself down on his bed, and in a few minutes, as she
               judged by his hard and equal breathing, the old man was in a deep sleep.

               slumber the faces of the two men she had left below flitted and glared before her
               eyes. A sense of heat and suffocation, accompanied by a parching thirst, came over
               her, caused, perhaps, by the unusual closeness of the room. This feeling of
               oppression increased till the very walls and rafters seemed to approach nearer and
               close upon her all around. Unable any longer to endure this intolerable smothering
               sensation, she was just about to rise and open the door or window, when she heard
               the
               whispering of voices. She lay still and listened. The latch was raised cautiously,
               —
               the door opened, and the two Hogans entered: they trod so softly that, though she
               saw
               them move before her, she heard no foot-fall. They approached the bed of Halloran,
               and presently she heard a dull heavy blow, and then sounds — appalling sickening
               sounds — as of subdued struggles and smothered agony, which convinced her that they
               were murdering the unfortunate Pedlar.

               not wink or move; — there was a pause, a terrible pause, and then a whispering; —
               and
               presently Cathleen thought she could distinguish a third voice, as of expostulation,
               but all in so very low a tone that though the voices were close to her she could not
               hear a word that was uttered. After some moments, which appeared an age of agonising
               suspense, the wretches withdrew, and Cathleen was left alone, and in darkness. Then,
               indeed, she felt as one ready to die: to use her own affecting language, "the heart
               within me," said she, "melted away like water, but I was resolute not to swoon, and
               I
               <em>did not</em>. I knew that if I would preserve my life, I must keep the

            <p>It was most fortunate that Cathleen came to this determination, for without the

               eyes were now accustomed, she saw the head of the old woman bent forward in a
               listening attitude: in a few minutes the door closed, and then followed a whispering

               preceding evening, there was a much shorter way across some fields which she pointed
               out: Cathleen listened attentively to her directions, and then bidding farewell with
               many demonstrations of gratitude, she proceeded on her fearful journey. The cool
               morning air, the cheerful song of the early birds, the dewy freshness of the turf,
               were all unnoticed and unfelt: the sense of danger was paramount, while her faculties
               were all alive and awake to meet it, for a feverish and unnatural strength seemed
               to
               animate her limbs. She stepped on, shortly debating with herself whether to follow
               the directions given by the old woman. The high road appeared the safest; on the
               other hand, she was aware that the slightest betrayal of mistrust would perhaps be
               followed by her destruction; and thus rendered brave even by the excess of her fears,
               she determined to take the cross path. Just as she had come to this resolution, she
               reached the gate which she had been directed to pass through; and without the
               slightest apparent hesitation, she turned in, and pursued the lonely way through the
               fields. Often did she fancy she heard footsteps stealthily following her, and never
               approached a hedge without expecting to see the murderers start up from behind it;
               yet she never once turned her head, nor quickened nor slackened her pace;

               thick and dark grove of underwood, when she beheld seated upon the opposite stile
               an
               old woman in a red cloak. The sight of a human being made her heart throb more
               quickly for a moment; but on approaching nearer, with all her faculties sharpened
               by
               the sense of danger, she perceived that it was no old woman, but the younger Hogan,
               the murderer of Halloran, who was thus disguised. His face was partly concealed by
               a
               blue handkerchief tied round his head and under his chin, but she knew him by the
               peculiar and hideous expression of his eyes: yet with amazing and almost incredible
               self-possession, she continued to advance without manifesting the least alarm, or
               sign of recognition; and walking up to the pretended old woman, said in a clear

               woman," said the monster, in a whining, snuffling tone. "Nothing have I in this wide
               world," said Cathleen, quietly disengaging her gown, but without moving. "Sure its
               only yesterday I was robbed of all I had but the little clothes on my back, and if
               I
               hadn't met with charity from others I'd have starved by the way side by this

               her to apply there. "Sure they're good, honest people, though poor enough, God help
               them," she continued, "and I wish ye mother, no worse luck than myself had, and
               that's a good friend to treat ye to a supper, aye, and a breakfast too; there it is,

               road; she could see crowds of people on horseback and on foot, with cars and
               carriages passing along in one direction; for it was, though Cathleen did not then
               know it, the first day of the Cork Assizes. As she gazed, she wished for the wings

               a bird that she might in a moment flee over the space which intervened between her
               and safety; for though she could clearly see the high road from the hill on which
               she
               stood, a valley of broken ground at its foot, and two wide fields still separated
               her
               from it; but with the same unfailing spirit, and at the same steady pace, she
               proceeded onwards: and now she had reached the middle of the last field, and a thrill
               of new born hope was beginning to flutter at her heart, when suddenly two men burst
               through the fence at the farther side of the field, and advanced towards her. One
               of
               these she thought at the first glance resembled her husband, but that it was her
               husband himself was an idea which never entered her mind. Her imagination was
               possessed with the one supreme idea of danger and death by murderous hands; she
               doubted not that these were the two Hogans in some new disguise, and silently

            <p>Towards evening she became more composed, and was able to give some account of the

               fortune in the neighbourhood, and a magistrate, was riding by late that evening on
               his return from the Assizes at Cork, and stopped at the inn to refresh his horse.
               Hearing that something unusual and frightful had occurred, he alighted, and examined
               the woman himself, in the presence of one or two persons. Her tale appeared to him

               courage and sufferings so exceedingly incredible, that he was at first inclined to

               sent off information of the murder to Cork. Constables with a warrant were despatched

               which Cathleen at once identified as belonging to herself, and Reilly's silver watch

               she had gone out on the Carrick road to beg, having been left by her husband and son
               for two days without the means of support; and finding Cathleen asleep, she had taken
               away the bundle, supposing it to contain food; and did not recognise her as the same
               person she had robbed, till Cathleen offered her part of her supper.

            <p>At this moment Cathleen rushed from the arms of her husband, and throwing herself
               on
               her knees, with clasped hands, and cheeks streaming with tears, begged for mercy for
               the old woman. "Mercy, my lord judge!" she exclaimed. "Gentlemen, your honours, have
               mercy on her. She had mercy on me! She only did their bidding. As for the bundle and
               all in it, I give it to her with all my soul, so it's no robbery. The grip of
               hunger's hard to bear; and if she hadn't taken it then, where would I have been now?
               Sure they would have killed me for the sake of the watch, and I would have been a
               corpse before your honours this moment. O mercy! mercy for her! or never will I sleep
               asy on this side of the grave!"
            </p>
            <p>The judge, though much affected, was obliged to have her forcibly carried from the
               court, and justice took its awful course. Sentence of death was pronounced on all
               the
               prisoners; but the woman was reprieved, and afterwards transported. The two men were
               executed within forty-eight hours after their conviction, on the Gallows Green. They
               made no public confession of their guilt, and met their fate with sullen
               indifference. The awful ceremony was for a moment interrupted by an incident with

               speculation among the superstitious populace. It was well known that the younger
               Hogan had been long employed on the estate of a nobleman in the neighbourhood; but
               having been concerned in the abduction of a young female, under circumstances of
               peculiar atrocity, which for the want of legal evidence could not be brought home
               to
               him, he was dismissed; and, finding himself an object of general execration, he had
               since been skulking about the country, associating with housebreakers and other
               lawless and abandoned characters. At the moment the hangman was adjusting the rope
               round his neck, a shrill voice screamed from the midst of the crowd, "Barny Hogan!
               do
               ye mind Grace Power, and the last words ever she spoke to ye?" there was a general
               movement and confusion; no one could or would tell whence the voice proceeded. The
               wretched man was seen to change countenance for the first time, and raising himself
               on tiptoe, gazed wildly round upon the multitude: but he said nothing; and in a few
               minutes he was no more.

               the true sense of the word. Her story, her sufferings, her extraordinary fortitude,
               and pure simplicity of character made her an object of general curiosity and

               was exceedingly pious after the fashion of her creed and country, founded yearly
               masses for the soul of the poor Pedlar; and vowed herself to make a pilgrimage of
               thanksgiving to St. Gobnate's well. Mr. L. the magistrate who had first examined her
               in the little inn at Balgowna, made her a munificent present; and anxious, perhaps,
               to offer yet farther amends for his former doubts of her veracity, he invited Reilly
               on very advantageous terms, to settle on his estate, where he rented a neat cabin,
               and a <em>handsome</em> plot of potatoe ground. There Reilly and his Cathleen
               were living ten years ago, with an increasing family, and in the enjoyment of much
               humble happiness; and there, for aught I know to the contrary, they may be living

               soft voice near me.

               leaning on the back of my cousin Agatha's couch, with my eyes resting on the sheet
               of
               music paper which lay before her. I coloured as her glance met mine.

               either my womanhood, or my judgment?"
            </p>
            <p>"There you may answer it yourself — what woman can judge of her sex's failings! —
               what beautiful woman can deal fairly by a sister beauty?"

               of the day!"
            </p>
            <p>"It is the cant of ages," said I.</p>

               a
               heart and head to think, and to feel — no, my dear cousin, do not repeat it. There

               us with the world at large — search well, and we shall discover our injustice —

               the expression of her bland and beautiful countenance seemed almost as if it grew

            <p>There was a gentleness, a delicacy, and a tenderness in my cousin Agatha's

               character which seemed to have inspired the gracefulness of her person and her every
               motion, her tone of feeling, both in gaiety and sorrow, irresistible. I seated myself
               beside her on the sofa, and did as she had bid me. "I have been in love," said I,

            <p>"When I first went abroad," said I, "I spent some time at Florence. The fashionable
               lounge was the picture-gallery, and there was I a daily visitor but I went thither
               really to gratify my passion for paintings, and not to gaze, and be gazed at by the
               company. One morning while I was standing as usual before my favorite study, I was
               startled by some one tapping me lightly on the shoulder, I suddenly turned round —
               it
               was a lady, and one of the most beautiful of earth's creatures; but her look and
               attitude were even more striking than her countenance and figure. She was, in a
               manner, stealing a glance into my face, with such a curiosity, and interest, and
               earnestness, blended with such a fanciful coquetry and intelligence in her expression
               as amazed me. She enjoyed my surprise and admiration for about half a second, and
               then with the most natural negligence in the world, pointed gracefully with the hand
               which still rested on my arm, to the ground. It was her handkerchief that had fallen
               at my feet, and I instantly stooped, and raised it. She stretched out her hand to
               receive it, before I had even time to present it to her, nodded her head half with
               the air of a pleased child, half with the air of a woman of fashion, and then folding

               and a certain air much superior to it; but there was a something so whimsical in her
               style of dress, and in her style of appearance altogether, to make me feel uncertain
               what to think of her.

               addressed me; I forget now what it was she said to me, something about my favourite
               painting, or my general fondness for pictures; whatever it might be, I was so much
               a
               novice in fashion as to feel uncomfortable at her speaking to me. I remember,
               however, that though her words were select, her manner struck me as common-place;
               she, moreover, seemed to me a coquette, and I immediately concluded that she must
               be
               marked by all the silliness of her class. In appearance she might have been about
               two
               or three and twenty, but I suspect she was more, perhaps from my own inexperience,
               for she struck me as being used to the ways of the world. It was evident that she
               was
               aware of the admiration which she had elicited, that she had expected it, and was
               therefore pleased with it, and meant to excite a little more. No one but a boy,
               probably no one but such a boy as I, would have been seized with these reflexions

               her frivolous familiarity of manners. I left Florence soon after, but I carried some

               concert room just as her carriage was announced — she had been standing near the
               doorway, and I was the last person she bowed to as she left the room. I remember it
               was near the end of the season. She was the fashion in London, but I had never
               admired her. I had heard her talked of as beautiful, but I had never thought her so.
               She was striking, but it was an air of fashion more than either beauty or grace in
               her appearance. I liked her reception of me; I had always allowed her to be a fine
               woman, and I found something extremely agreeable in her countenance when she spoke,
               and extreme good nature in her general manner. She rather interested me than
               otherwise, though she had only just stayed to receive my bow, and observe to me "that

               was of a rude description of men; he was seldom to be seen in the house but at
               dinner, and at dinner he liked to have plenty of people to talk to, and to listen
               to
               him. If his cold be called society, at table they had his society, but otherwise
               these general chance kind of guests were but little attended to. I should scarcely
               have availed myself, however, of this manner of admittance to hospitality, had I not

               seen a starting tear bedew her cheek. But why should I instruct you in all the arts
               and all the expedients of her most reprehensible coquetry; it was as restless as
               extravagant. She had probably never loved her husband, and esteem was what she could
               bestow on none. She was incapable of friendship; her heart had been framed to
               sentiment, she had no steadiness in her nature to persevere in her affections. Her
               husband was little calculated to excite either, and to Gabriella he was peculiarly
               unsuited. They seldom met, but no appearance of unharmony subsisted between them.
               I
               have known her consult him on a matter of duty, and him leave to her the choice of
               the inscriptions on his dog-collars. He never interfered with her, but he was

               then, in my opinion, by much her least qualification. Yet she possessed a large share
               of the essentials which constitute beauty: her outline of feature was good, and her
               complexion must once have been brilliant. At times it was still beautiful, for
               Gabriella was no longer quite what is called a very young woman when I knew her.

               self-possession too, only that to me she was never self-possessed. She had often
               turned off an uncomfortable sentence with a gay laugh, which has covered me with
               confusion and offence, and I have felt that I should yet have been more at ease had
               she been less so.

               rising, or risen into fame and fashion, observed that in no country in the world did
               there exist such perfect domestic and conjugal happiness as in England — such an

               aspire to. She is charged with the dearest interests of one more responsible in life
               than herself — his most tender dignity is confided to her care, and if she break her
               trust, if she be wanting but in the smallest portion of this silent bond, she
               violates the most solemn engagement of her life, and is forsworn before God and man

               "<em>Beau Leverton</em>." As every thing which relates to him "belongs" — as

               upon record. We respect a beau of the first brilliancy; and wonder at his appearance,
               as at that of an aloe. He is perhaps even a rarer marvel.
            </p>
            <p>Here, however, let us caution the reader. We would not be understood as paying
               implicit homage to the stuffed figures which move in procession down Bond and St.
               James's Streets, kept upright solely by the aid of staymakers and tailors. On the
               contrary, we hold them to be of precisely the same advantage in a commonwealth, that
               those less ostentatious shapes are which keep watch in country gardens, as perpetual,
               centinels over the peas and currants. But Leverton was not one of this small-witted
               genus. He was originally intended for something even higher than what he became. Fate

               man
               of a shrewd turn of mind; too idle to emancipate himself from the thrall of fashion,
               but laughing down with ineffable contempt the pretensions of the small fry around
               him. He saw far into character, and sometimes made it subservient to his purposes.
               He
               had flashes (scintillations) of wit, which brightened and became more frequent in
               melancholy hours, as the electric fluid is seen more clearly in a storm. He told a
               story well, — laughed in the right place, — drew out the follies of his neighbours
               with a fine, humorous, and sometimes unsparing, hand, — had a smattering of the
               classics, and the lighter literature of England and France, — made champagne tea
               delightfully, and scattered his multitudes of bon mots upon the crowd, as a peasant
               does his arms-full of grapes and chestnuts upon the swine who are expecting them
               beneath. Unluckily, Leverton's audiences in general did not comprehend a little of
               the value of his donations. They laughed, however, at his jests, because it was the
               fashion to laugh at them; and they related them to others, from time to time, in the
               hope of, one day or other, discovering the meaning themselves.

               quoted his last line of Horace at the cunning-eyed groom, who lashed his portmanteau
               to the chaise, and came up to London, 'to make his — reputation!'
            </p>
            <p>His success was eminent, but gradual; for he did not aim so much at eccentricity
               (which is a cheap accomplishment) as at an air of high-breeding and careless
               brilliancy. He possessed extreme ease, and considerable with; and the pungency of
               the
               one quality had an admirable effect upon the other, as salt is said to draw forth
               an
               exquisite flavor from things which would else be tasteless. One joke, which he threw
               off in a happy moment, attracted the respect of a smart speaker in the House of
               Commons. Another (which was better) reached the ear of an illustrious personage, who
               said that it reminded him of George Selwyn. He enquired very particularly the name
               of
               the author, and the fame of our hero was complete!

               friend) we are possessed of considerable materials for the purpose. But we must
               content ourselves with passing over many of the accidents and humours of his career,
               and introducing him to the reader as he appeared to us, <em>in propria
                  persona</em>, on the third day of July, 18 — .
            </p>
            <p>At that time he had lodgings in Dover-street, and as eminent a list of creditors and
               friends, 'of the first water,' as any gentleman who ever disowned the serious age
               of
               three and forty. In regard to his person, he had increased somewhat in bulk, though
               it was said that stays, or some such unseen bonds, curtailed the encroachments of
               idleness or gourmanderie. Yet, he still walked well; dressed inimitably; lost his
               money (when he had it) gracefully; drawled out his sly witticisms with considerable
               effect; and was in all respects a 'highly fashionable man.'
            </p>
            <p>Leverton's importance in society was, in fact, exceedingly great; more so than his
               mere talent could have commanded. His ease was admired — his manners and his dress
               imitated — his flattery coveted — his patronage wooed. His satire was dreaded also;
               for he possessed (as the bee does) both the honey and the sting, — the wish sometimes
               to charm, and always the spirit to repel. The gay loved his jokes; the young sought
               his intimacy; the women smiled on him; the (merely) rich dreaded him; and the </p>

               the
               adjustment of table napkins. To these succeeded the clatter of china, the occasional
               jarring of silver, the quick tread of the servants to and fro, and such like

               had seen them, Leverton?"

               statues; dingy pictures; belts of wampum; rings for the nose; fish bones for the
               ears; druids' clubs; absurdities of every kind, from the equator to the poles.
               Nothing was wanting — that was useless. There were sixteen tons of Egyptian horrors
               blocking up the approach to the house; and five and twenty hundred weight of cracked
               marble, which I took for a cistern, but which turned out to be the coffin of Ptolemy
               Psammeticus. Every corner of every room was put in requisition. The hall was full;
               the staircase was fuller; the dining-room could not be carpeted for these monsters.
               Heads, legs, arms, noses, hideous little wretches in bronze and china affronted you
               at every turn. Even the cellar was blocked up by a shapeless person, which the doctor
               called Alexander, or Demetrius, or — I forget what; and we had a tedious harangue
               on
               a foolish subject, instead of a bottle of Madeira with our sandwiches.

               you. There was a head of Jupiter Stator, without a nose, receiving adoration from
               a

               that ever attracted his admiration. After gazing at her for five minutes, with
               evident symptoms of delight, he turned to his neighbour and

               on
               general politics. Colonel Dartley chattered a vast quantity of nothing upon "the

            <p>THE palace of Nonsuch, near Ewell, in Surrey, was intended by Henry the Eighth, as
               its proud title sufficiently attests, to afford an unrivalled specimen of his
               magnificence and taste; but, while he was lavishing his treasures in this most
               unnecessary addition to his royal residences, Death was sharpening the dart which
               was
               to tumble down the ostentatious tyrant, and consign him to his last narrow palace
               —
               the tomb.
            </p>
            <p>Nonsuch was left unfinished, and unfulfilled promise of splendour, a gorgeous and
               yet
               melancholy evidence of the uncertainty of human grandeur; and Queen Mary, shrinking
               from the cost of its completion, had it in contemplation to ull it down to save
               farther charges; when the Earl of Arundel, "for the love and honour he bore to his
               old master," purchased the place, and finished it according to the original design.

               left behind it, sounds in our ears like a mournful echo, mocking the presumption of
               other times. And yet the proud structure was not deficient in solidity as well as
               stateliness. "It was built round two courts," says the accomplished authoress of
               Queen Elizabeth's Memoirs — "an outer and an inner one, both very spacious; and the
               entrance to each was by a square gate-house highly ornamented, embattled, and having
               turrets at the four corners. These gate-houses were of stone, as was the lower story
               of the palace itself; but the upper one was of wood, "richly adorned, and set forth
               and garnished with a variety of statues, pictures, and other antic forms of excellent
               art and workmanship, and of no small cost;" all which ornaments, it seems, were made
               of rye dough. In modern language the pictures would probably be called
               basso-relievos. From the eastern and western angles of the inner court rose two
               slender turrets, five stories high, with lanterns on the top, which were leaded and
               surrounded with wooden balustrades. These towers of observation, from which the two
               parks attached to the palace, and a wide expanse of champaign country beyond, might
               be surveyed as in a map, were celebrated as the peculiar boast of Nonsuch.

               horns, were crouching in the shade: the cows, that were usually pastured around the
               gatehouse, had not yet returned from the farm, whither they had been driven to be
               milked; and with the exception of a single stately stag which emerged from a thicket,

               communicated by a flight of stone steps with the park, was assembled a little party,

               affording good entertainment to their royal mistress, when it should please her to
               begin the sports and pastimes of the day. Among these was old Yeovil, one of the
               huntsmen, a withered weatherbeaten figure, but with a patch of red upon either
               cheek-bone, that seemed to attest he might still be in at a good many deaths before
               his own. He held three leash of greyhounds by leathern thongs, and was surrounded

               several couple of staghounds, most of the latter being crouched at his feet, dosing

               of
               Bottom the Weaver, had not been yet long enough before the public to banish the rage
               for such emblematic foolery: nor would it under any circumstances have been likely
               to
               exert a beneficial influence upon Master Toby, who sometimes made furtive excursions
               from the scullery into the regions of Parnassus, and whose taste had been exclusively
               derived from the quaint devices of those symbolical banquets he had assisted in
               cooking; and which, from their hieroglyphical character, had received the appropriate
               name of Subtleties. At this self-appointed masque-master, who with a paper in one
               hand, and a cane in the other, was strutting about, endeavouring to get up a
               rehearsal as well among the amateur actors by whom he was surrounded, some of whom
               were attired as allegorical females, the calm old huntsman gazed with a quiet
               wonderment, that kept his face fixed in an intermediate expression between a simper
               and a sneer. And, sooth to say, they must have exhibited a puzzling sort of
               cross-reading to a straightforward man like him, who knew all the parties by sight,
               but neither understood why they were thus strangely metamorphosed, nor comprehended

               condescended to give him a letter to his special good friend the Lord Essex,

               expectation; but having learnt, within the last half hour, that his lordship had

               however, turned round and conversed familiarly with him till they entered the
               gardens, which according to the prevailing taste were laid out in trim beds, formal
               parterres, fountains, and successive terraces, communicating withone another by
               flights of stone steps, and ornamented with vases, statues, and groupes of sculpture.
               At the extremity of one of these terraces stood a little pavilion called the
               Paradise, being decorated with representations of Adam and Eve, the Serpent and the
               Tree of Knowledge; and having an arbour for its entrance engrailed with clustering
               althaeas, jessamines, honeysuckles, roses, pomegranates, and other flowering shrubs,

               of his flattery had not yet passed away, and their conference had lasted for some
               time when the Queen, looking towards Shakspeare, enquired whether his squire, who
               seemed but young in years, had left his locks in the hands of the Irish rebels, that
               he wore so bald a brow. "I much fear me that I am presumptuous and overbold," said
               the Earl after having mentioned the name and object of his attendant. "I who am
               myself but a petitioner for mercy and forgiveness, in thus becoming a suitor for

            <p>"The lines might easily have passed from out my head," replied the Earl, "but they
               related to my admired sovereign, and therefore were they treasured in my heart of
               hearts." He laid his hand upon his breast as he spoke; Elizabeth looked pleased,
               though she noticed not the speech, but turning to Shakspeare, resumed, "we have
               already passed our pardon for this liberty of your pen, wherefore we rebuke it not;
               and touching the licence that you seek, it shall be even as you wish, and our

               of your prayers, and since they are henceforward to be put up for our own well and
               welfare, you shall neither lack the means to proffer them, nor a memorial of her for
               whom you pray." So saying, Elizabeth took a volume from a low table that stood beside
               her chair, and graciously extended it to Shakspeare with these words: "The Queen
               presents you her prayer-book: you may retire."<a href="#10" id="back10"><sup>10</sup></a>  Judging from the latter command </p>

               unfortunately encountered the fair Mrs. Bridges, one of the maids of honor, with whom
               he had long been suspected of being deeply in love, and who on his account had

               neck, dashed it to the ground, and exclaimed with a look, and voice that sufficiently
               declared her to be the daughter of Henry the Eighth:

               delay and numerous vacillations, occasioned by the miserable perplexity of the
               Queen's mind, as she fluctuated between severity and returning tenderness, she at
               length publicly disgraced him, and deprived him of all his great offices and
               emoluments. Always haughty and ungovernable, and rendered alike desperate in fortune
               and in mind by these indignities, the ill-fated Earl was driven to those frantic and
               well known projects of rebellion which shortly afterwards conducted him to the
               scaffold.

            <p id="1">1. [Note to Preface:] A few
               stanzas of the Ballad by Mr. Lockhart were printed in the “Janus” for 1826. It is
               so considerably improved and enlarged, the translation being now complete, as to
               assume a new character. [Bijou Editor, William Fraser.] <a href="#back1">Back</a></p>
            <p id="2">2. [Note to Preface:] Mr. Gillies
               beautiful Poem called “The seventh Day,” is, for want of space, reserved for the
               next volume. [Bijou Editor, William Fraser.] <a href="#back2">Back</a></p>
            <p id="3">3. [Note to "The Hellweathers":] A
               few hours before the ships struck, Sir Cloudesley Shovel hove out the signal to
               lie to, in order to ascertain the situation of the fleet. [Author, N.T.
               Carrington.] <a href="#back3">Back</a></p>
            <p id="4">4. [Note to "Ane
               Waefu' Scots Pastoral":] These verses were written on the evening of the 23rd
               of April, 1827, about the time the great storm of snow was at the height. Next
               morning many of the snow wreathes on the hills of Ettrick Forest were from
               twelve to twenty feet deep, and many thousands of lambs, singing birds, and
               moor game perished. All those of the latter that had begun incubation were
               literally destroyed. [Author, James Hogg.] <a href="#back4">Back</a></p>
            <p id="5">5. [Note to "Ane Waefu' Scots Pastoral":] SANDY or SANDY-LAVEROCK
               is the local name in Ettrick for the sand piper. [Author, James Hogg.] <a href="#back5">Back</a></p>
            <p id="6">6. [Note to "The
               Ritter Von Reichenstein":] This Austrian story has its foundation in fact. The
               ruins of Reichenstein Castle are still visible in the district of Muhl, on the
               river Ens; and in the chapel is the Baron's monument, finely executed by an
               Italian master. [Fraser and/or Author.] <a href="#back6">Back</a></p>
            <p id="7">7. [Note to "A Familiar Epistle to Sir Thomas Lawrence":] The children of Mr.
               Calmeady. [Fraser and/or Author] <a href="#back7">Back</a></p>
            <p id="8">8. [Note to "A Familiar
               Epistle to Sir Thomas Lawrence":] See the <a href="#F6">accompanying
                  Engraving</a>. [Bijou Editor, William Fraser] <a href="#back8">Back</a></p>
            <p id="9">9. [Note to "An
               Address to the Lost Wig of John Bell, Esq.":]Not the town, (which would be of
               little service to a dunce) but a learned and ingenious conveyancer of that
               name. [Fraser or Author.] <a href="#back9">Back</a></p>
            <p id="10">10. [Note to "Essex and the Maid of
               Honour":] The book thus presented Shakespeare, we may suppose to be that beautiful
               and rare volume, described by Dr. Dibdin in his Bibliographical Decameron, and
               known among collectors as Queen Elizabeth's Prayer Book. Through the friendship of
               Mr. Freeling (from a copy in his possession) the Proprietors are enabled to
               present an admirable facsimile of one leaf. The extract, is part of a prayer by
               the celebrated John Fox, author of the Book of Martyrs. Dr. Dibdin says, "I wish I
               knew more of the private history of this elegant volume at all events if you feel
               disposed to loosen your purse strings, purchase one of the earlier editions of it,
               on account of the superior sharpness or truth of the outline." The Doctor adds
               that the first edition is dated 1569, the second 1578, the third 1581, the fourth
               1590, and the fifth 1608. [Author, Horace Smith.] <a href="#back10">Back</a></p>

               appears in the 1852 <span class="">Poetical Works</span> by David Macbeth Moir. [Poetess Archive Editor.] <a href="#back11">Back</a></p>
