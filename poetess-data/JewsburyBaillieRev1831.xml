				<p><ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">J<hi rendition="#smcaps">oanna</hi> B<hi
							rendition="#smcaps">aillie</hi></ref> holds that rank amongst our elder
					modern authors, and her poetry is so connected with that re-awakening of our
					literature which took place about the commencement of the present century, that
					whatever she writes, however slight, or however unequal to the works which made
					her fame, has a peculiar claim to respectful attention. Of <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref>&apos;s intellectual
					strength, of her profound knowledge of the workings of passion, rendered more
					extraordinary by the placidity with which she herself delineates them&#8212;of
						<ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref>&apos;s genius
					and language, which are both so essentially old-English, deep, sound, vigorous,
					unfeigned, and unadulterate&#8212;we are proud to express our admiration. It
					would afford a subject for a long and not uninteresting article to point out the
					striking difference in the mind and writings of the literary women of thirty and
					forty years ago, and the literary women of the present time: those who have not
					perused their writings in connexion, will hardly believe how great is the
					difference;&#8212;what a commentary the perusal affords on the entire change
					that has obtained in habits, manners, feelings, education, tastes, and life!
					Amongst the elders&#8212;with <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> at their head, as regards
					mind&#8212;the distinguishing features are nerve, simplicity, vigour,
					continuity, unambitious earnestness, and good English. We find also elaborate
					and skilfully-developed plots. Amongst our distinguished women of later date, we
					find accomplishment, grace, brilliancy, sentiment, scenery poetically sketched,
					and character acutely handled; talent in all shapes and ways, but not so much
					that can claim the name of genius. There is nothing of what we have called
					continuity. Writing little but detached tales or novels, which, however clever
					are only volumes of episodes, separate scenes, and striking characters, most of
					them unconnected with the main business of the book&#8212;it is as <hi
						rendition="#italics">sketchers</hi>, whether for vivacity or pathos, nature
					or art; as <hi rendition="#italics">sketchers</hi>, whether of the country, the
					town, or the heart, of life or of manners, that our gifted women are now chiefly
					distinguished. In the female poetry too of the present day, fascinating
					tenderness, brilliancy of fancy, and beauty of feeling, stand in the place of
					sustained loftiness of imagination, and compact artist-like diction. Our elder
					literary women were, in the spirit of their intellect, more essentially
					masculine; our younger ones are integrally feminine&#8212;women of fashionable
					as well as studious life, women generally, who not only write books but abound
					in elegant accomplishments.</p>
				<p>We have not, and are not likely to have at present, another <ref
						target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wolstencroft</ref> (we merely
					speak of her as having exhibited grasp of mind), another <ref
						target="people.html#InchbaldMrs">Mrs. Inchbald</ref>, another <ref
						target="people.html#RadcliffeAnn">Mrs. Radcliffe</ref>&#8212;<ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> is their only
					representative; adding, to the power of mind which they possessed, that
					dignified play of fancy, that amplitude of calm, bold thought, and that
					&quot;accomplishment of verse&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><ref
								target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">William Wordsworth</ref>,
									<title><hi rendition="#italics">The Excursion</hi></title>, Book
							First, The Wanderer 77-80.</note></hi> which they possessed not. Modern
					imaginative literature in England owes much to her &apos;<title>Plays on the
						Passions</title>;&apos;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><ref
								target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>&apos;s <title><hi
									rendition="#italics">Plays on the Passions</hi></title> was
							published in three volumes as <title><hi rendition="#italics">A Series
									of Plays in which it is Attempted to Delineate the Stronger
									passions of the Mind </hi></title> (1798-1812). <title><hi
									rendition="#italics">Ethewald </hi></title> and <title><hi
									rendition="#italics">Count Basil </hi></title> (see below) are
							two of her plays. </note></hi> perhaps more than to any other
					publication except &apos;<title><ref target="people.html#PercyThomas"
							>Percy</ref>&apos;s Reliques</title>;&apos; at all events, our greatest
					poets, who were young when her plays appeared, have nearly all borne testimony
					to the advantage and delight with which they perused them. With all this, the
					name of <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> is not
					buzzed and blazoned about as very inferior names are; her works do not attain
					the honour of calf and gold in libraries where inferior works shine; poetical
					readers of strong sensibility and uncultivated taste do not dote upon
						&apos;<title>Basil</title>,&apos; or quote from
					&apos;<title>Ethwald</title>;&apos; and we never, by any chance, saw a line of
					hers transcribed in an album! One or two of her Shakespearian snatches of song
					have been set to music; but, (to quote the words of an able critic,) &quot;The
					celebrity of <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref> has
					been of a most peculiar nature; her fame has had about it a peculiar purity. It
					has been the unparticipated treasure of the world of taste and
						intellect.&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot">William Harness,
							&quot;Celebrated Female Writers: <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
								>Joanna Baillie</ref>,&quot; <hi rendition="#italics"
								>Blackwood&apos;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> 16 (August 1824):
							165.</note></hi> We know that with this illustrious authoress there is a
					noble carelessness of praise, partly consequent on her years, her standing in
					society, and her having simply written at the instigation of her own genius;
					obeying the voice from the shrine, and not the command of the outer-court
					worshippers; but still, we feel vexed to see women of later date, and, however
					gifted, every way inferior to <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna
						Baillie</ref>, written about, and likenessed, and lithographed, before <hi
						rendition="#smcaps">her</hi>&#8212;the senior and superior of all.</p>
				<p>These casual remarks will prove that we appreciate <ref
						target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref>; we can, therefore,
					with better grace express our regret that she has just published the little
					work, the name of which heads this notice. It is controversial, and controversy
					is best left to learned divines&#8212;certainly better left alone by ladies.</p>
