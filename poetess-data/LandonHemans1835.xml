               </hi> Such is the secret of poetry. There
					cannot be a greater error than to suppose that the poet does not feel what he
					writes. What an extraordinary, I might say, impossible view, is this to take of
					an art more connected with emotion than any of its sister sciences.
					What—the depths of the heart are to be sounded, its mysteries unveiled,
					and its beatings numbered by those whose own heart is made by this strange
					doctrine—a mere machine wound up by the clock-work of rhythm! No; poetry
					is even more a passion than a power, and nothing is so strongly impressed on
					composition as the character of the writer. I should almost define poetry to be
					the necessity of feeling strongly in the first instance, and the as strong
					necessity of confiding in the second.</p>

					those who would shrink from avowing what and how much they feel to even the most
					trusted friend, yet rely upon and crave for the sympathy of the many. The belief
					that it exists in the far off and the unknown is inherent as love or death.
					Under what pressure of the most discouraging circumstances has it existed, given
					enjoyment, and stimulated to exertion. The ill-fated and yet gifted being,
					steeped to the lips in poverty—that bitterest closer of the human
					heart—surrounded by the cold and the careless—shrinking from his
					immediate circle, who neglect and misunderstand him, has yet faith in the far
					away. Suffering discourses eloquent music, and it believes that such music will
					find an echo and reply where the music only is known, and the maker loved for
					its sake.</p>
            <p>Fame, which the Greeks idealized so nobly, is but the fulfillment of that desire
					for sympathy which can never be brought home to the individual. It is the
					essence of such a nature to ask too much. It expects to be divined where its too
					shy to express. Praise—actual personal praise—oftener frets and
					embarrasses than it encourages. It is too small when too near. There is also the
					fear of mistaking the false Florimel flattery for the true Florimel praise.<hi rendition="#sup">

					warm, kindly, and congenial, and where it is not ashamed. Without such timidity,
					without such irritability, without a proneness to exaggeration, the poetical
					temperament could not exist. Nor is its reliance on distance and on solitude in
					vain. We talk, and can never be sure but that our hearers listen as much from
					kindness as from interest. Their mood may or may not be in unison with our own.
					If this be the case even in ordinary intercourse, how much more must it be felt
					where the most shrinking, subtle, and sorrowful ideas are to be expressed. But

            <p> In such a mood the voice of passionate complaining is both understood and
					welcome. There is a well of melancholy poetry in every human bosom. We have all
					mourned over the destroyed illusion and the betrayed hope. We have quarrelled in
					some embittered moment with an early friend, and when too late lamented the
					estrangement. We have all stood beside the grave, and asked of the long grass
					and ever-springing wild flowers why they should have life, while that of the
					beloved has long since gone down to the dust. How many have <quote>

            <p>I remember to have read of an Hanoverian chorister, who, having lost by an early

            <p>I believe that no poet ever made his readers feel unless he had himself felt. The
					many touching poems which most memories keep as favourites originated in some
					strong personal sensation. I do not mean to say that the fact is set down, but
					if any feeling is marked in the writing, that feeling has been keenly and
					painfully experienced. No indication of its existence would probably be shown in
					ordinary life: first, because the relief of expression has already been found in
					poetry, and secondly, from that extreme sensitiveness which shrinks from contact
					with the actual. Moreover, the habit has so grown up with us,—so grown
					with our growth, and strengthened with our strength, that we scarcely know the
					extraordinary system of dissimulation carried on in our present state of
					society.</p>
            <p> In childhood, the impetus of conversation is curiosity. The child talks to ask
					questions. But one of its first lessons, as it advances, is that a question is
					an intrusion, and an answer a deceit. Ridicule parts social life like an
					invisible paling; and we are all of us afraid of the other. To this may be in
					great measure attributed the difference that exists between an author's
					writings and his conversation. The one is often sad and thoughtful, while the
					other is lively and careless. The fact is, that the real character is shown in
					the first instance, and the assumed in the second. Besides the impulses of an
					imaginative temperament are eager and easily excited, and gaiety has its
					impulses as well as despondency, but it is less shy of showing them. Only those
					in the habit of seclusion, occupied with their own thoughts, can know what a
					relief it is sometimes to spring, as it were, out of themselves. The fertile
					wit, the sunny vivacity, belong to a nature which must be what the French so
					happily term <hi rendition="#italics">impressionable</hi> to be poetical. The
					writer of <pb n="427"/> a recent memoir of Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref> deems it necessary almost to

            <p> No emotion is more truly, or more often pictured in her song, than that craving
					for affection which answers not unto the call. The very power that she
					possesses, and which, in early youth, she perhaps deemed would both attract and
					keep, is, in reality, a drawback. Nothing can stand its test. The love which the
					spirit hath painted has too much of its native heaven for earth. In how many and
					exquisite shapes is this vain longing introduced on her page. Some slight
					incident gives the framework, but she casts her own colour upon the picture. In
					this consists the difference between painting and poetry: the painter reproduces
					others,—the poet reproduces himself. We would draw attention especially to
					one or two poems in which the sentiment is too true for Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref> not to have been her own
					inspiration. Is it not the heart's long-suppressed bitterness that
					exclaims— <quote>

            <p> Did we not know this world to be but a place of trial—our bitter probation
					for another and for a better—how strange in its severity would seem the
					lot of genius in a woman. The keen feeling—the generous
					enthusiasm—the lofty aspiration—and the delicate
					perception—are given but to make the possessor unfitted for her actual
					position. It is well; such gifts, in their very contrast to the selfishness and
					the evil with which they are surrounded, inform us of another world—they
					breathe of their home, which is Heaven; the spiritual and the inspired in this
					life but fit us to believe in that which is to come. With what a sublime faith
					is this divine reliance expressed in all Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref>'s later writings. As
					the clouds towards nightfall melt away on a fine summer evening into the clear
					amber of the west, leaving a soft and unbroken azure whereon the stars may shine
					through; so the troubles of life, its vain regrets and vainer desires, vanished
					before the calm close of existence—the hopes of Heaven rose steadfast at
					last—the light shone from the windows of her home as she approached unto
					it. <quote>

            <p> We have noticed this yearning for affection—unsatisfied, but still
					unsubdued—as one characteristic of Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref>'s poetry: the rich
					picturesque was another. Highly accomplished, the varied stores that she
					possessed were all subservient to one master science. Mistress both of German
					and Spanish, the latter country appears to have peculiarly captivated her
					imagination. At that period when the fancy is peculiarly alive to
					impression—when girlhood is so new, that the eagerness of childhood is
					still in its delights—Spain was, of all others, the country on which
					public attention was fixed: victory after victory carried the British flag from
					the ocean to the Pyrenees; but, with that craving for the ideal which is so
					great a feature in her writings, the present was insufficient, and she went back
					upon the past;—the romantic history of the Moors was like a storehouse,
					with treasures gorgeous like those of its own Alhambra. </p>
            <p> It is observable in her minor poems that they turn upon an incident rather than
					a feeling. Feelings, true and deep, are developed; but one single emotion is
					never the original subject. Some graceful or touching anecdote or situation
					catches her attention, and its poetry is developed in a strain of mourning
					melody, and a vein of gentle moralizing. I <pb n="430"/> always wish, in reading
					my favourite poets, to know what first suggested my favourite poems. Few things
					would be more interesting than to know under what circumstances they were
					composed,—how much of individual sentiment there was in each, or how, on
					some incident seemingly even opposed, they had contrived to ingraft their own
					associations. What a history of the heart would such annals reveal! Every poem
					is in itself an impulse.</p>
            <p> Besides the ideal and the picturesque, Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref> is distinguished by her
					harmony. I use the word harmony advisedly, in contradistinction to melody.
					Melody implies something more careless, more simple, than belongs to her style:
					it is song by snatches; our English ballads are remarkable for it. To quote an
					instance or two. There is a verse in that of "Yarrow Water:"— <quote>

               </ref>, the sailor, we are
					often shipwrecked on a strange shore. We despair; but hope comes when least
					expected. We pass through the gloomy caverns of doubt into the free air and
					blessed sunshine of conviction and belief." I asked her if she thought Mrs.
						<ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref> a happy person; and she
					said, "No; her enjoyment is feverish, and she desponds. She is like a lamp
					whose oil is consumed by the very light which it yields." What a cruel
					thing is the weakness of memory! How little can its utmost efforts recall of
					conversation that was once an instruction and a delight!</p>
            <p>To the three characteristics of Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref>'s poetry which have already been mentioned—viz.,
					the ideal, the picturesque, and the harmonious—a fourth must be
					added,—the moral. Nothing can be more pure, more feminine and exalted,
					than the spirit which pervades the whole: it is the intuitive sense of right,
					elevated and strengthened into a principle. It is a glorious and a beautiful
					memory to bequeath; but she who left it is little to be envied. Open the volumes
					which she has left, legacies from many various hours, and what a record of
					wasted feelings and disappointed hopes may be traced in their sad and sweet
					complainings! Yet Mrs. <ref target="people.html#HemansFelicia">Hemans</ref> was
					spared some of the keenest mortifications of a literary career. She knew nothing
					of it as a profession which has to make its way through poverty, neglect, and
					obstacles: she lived apart in a small, affectionate circle of friends. The high
					road of life, with its crowds and contention—its heat, its noise, and its
					dust that rests on all—was for her happily at a distance; yet even in such
					green nest, the bird could not fold its wings, and sleep to its own music. There
					came the aspiring, the unrest, the aching sense of being misunderstood, the
					consciousness that those a thousand times inferior were yet more beloved. Genius
					places a woman in an unnatural position; notoriety frightens away affection; and
					superiority has for its attendant fear, not love. Its pleasantest emotions are

					her. Her letters were very brilliant, and I believe her correspondence was
					extensive; what a pity that they should not be collected. Speaking of Wordsworth
					she said, "There is about him a grand and noble plainness, a dignified
					simplicity—a something of high ideal Paganism, that I never saw in anyone
					else. He is not so much a rock covered with flowers, as a rock crowned with a
					castle. He is a dweller on the heights—he would have made a friend for
						<ref target="people.html#Phocion">Phocion</ref>. He reminds me of the
					Druidical oaks, strong and sacred." Again, while discussing the intercourse
					of society,—"You consider society something like a
					honeycomb—sweet, but hollow; so do I. But you seemed also to consider it
					expedient for every one by right or courtesy termed 'distinguished' to
					play truant—laying aside all habits of thought or feeling by which such
					distinction had been acquired. As if the earnestness of genius were less
					endurable than the heartlessness of the world; nay, as if the polished
					chain-mail of the latter were the only garb fit to be worn by the former.
					Personally speaking, I should be sorry to go into public with any other
					disposition than one anxious to give and willing to receive pleasure. Very high
					or very deep conversation, anything like communion of heart, would be out of
					place; but I do not see that we are called upon to pay so costly a compliment to
					society, as to assume a character diametrically opposed to our real world; to
					utter sentiments we secretly disbelieve—to be as angry with our better
					nature for their bursting from restraint, as at other times with our inferior
					nature for refusing submission.I think that wisdom may wear 'motley,'
					and truth, unlike man, be born laughing; and that until we go into society thus
