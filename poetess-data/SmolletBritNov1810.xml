                    year 1721, at the farm of Dalquhurn on the banks of the Leven, amidst some of
                    the most picturesque scenery of Scotland, to the beauties of which he afterwards
                    paid an elegant poetical tribute.<hi rendition="#sup">

               </hi> His father was the fourth son of <ref target="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">Sir James Smollet</ref>, of Bonhill:
                    he married, without his father's consent, a lady of no fortune; and dying
                    soon after the birth of his youngest son, his family, consisting of two sons and
                    a daughter, were left entirely dependent on the bounty of their grandfather for
                    a subsistence. The eldest, <ref target="people.html#SmollettJames">James</ref>,
                    went into the army. His regiment was ordered abroad; and the transport in which
                    he was, with part of the troops, was unfortunately lost off the coast of
                    America. He is mentioned as a young man of great promise, and Dr. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> always preserved towards
                    him an affectionate remembrance.</p>

                    memoir, was put to school at Dumbarton, where it is recorded that the first
                    efforts of his genius were shown in a copy of verses to the memory of <ref target="people.html#WallaceWilliam">Wallace</ref>, <fw type="vol" rendition="#smcaps" place="bottom-left">vol. xxx.</fw>

                    always a large share of that national spirit by which his countrymen are
                    generally distinguished. Young <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Tobias</ref>, however, was not always in the heroic mood. Many stories are
                    told of his exploits; and many acts of boyish mischief and frolic, recorded in

                    supposed to be supplied from the memory of his own early years. From Dumbarton
                    he was removed to Glasgow, where he was apprenticed to a surgeon, <ref target="people.html#agordonJohn">Mr. John Gordon</ref>, and at the same time
                    attended the University lectures of anatomy and medicine. At Glasgow he began to
                    display that vein of humour, and propensity to satire, which afterwards so
                    strongly distinguished him, at the expense of the circles to which he had
                    access, and even ventured to aim the shafts of his ridicule against some of the
                    graver sort, whose exterior of piety he represented, possibly with truth, as

            <p>His <ref target="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">grandfather</ref> died while he
                    was at Glasgow: and though he had maintained the family in a decent manner while
                    he lived, and would probably have continued so to do, he made little or no
                    provision for them at his death; and <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> on this event, his apprenticeship being finished, came up to
                    London to seek his fortune. On this occasion he was in want of money and
                    recommendations; his friends supplied him very sparingly with the former, but
                    were uncommonly liberal, he used to observe, in the latter article. <pb n="iii"/> He soon got a situation as surgeon's mate in a ship of the line, and
                    acted as such in the unfortunate expedition to Carthagena which took place in

                    vigorous, his powers of application strong, his execution rapid, and there were
                    few departments of general literature in which at one time or other he did not

                    his pen. At the age of eighteen he had written a play called <title>

                    regular plot, and no interest is excited for the hero, whose name serves to
                    string together a number of adventures. This work is in a great measure the
                    history of the author's own life. The novel opens with the story of a young
                    couple turned out of doors by their father on account of an imprudent match, and
                    their consequent distress. It is natural and affecting. The cool selfish
                    character of the parent, the scene of the female relations besieging his
                    deathbed, the opening of the will, and the disappointment of the gaping cousins,
                    are all admirably drawn, and probably contain much of the author's own
                    story on the death of his <ref target="people.html#SirJamesSmollett">grandfather</ref>. The character of a British tar<hi rendition="#sup">
                  <note place="foot" anchored="true">Slang for a common sailor.</note>
               </hi> is portrayed in that
                    of Tom Bowling, uncle to the hero of the piece. It has been the original of most
                    sailor characters which have been since exhibited. He is drawn brave, blunt,
                    generous, enthusiastically fond of his profession, and with <pb n="vi"/> a
                    mixture of surliness in the expression of his kindest affections. There is an
                    admirable stroke of nature in his behaviour, when, after attending the opening
                    of the will, he walks away with his nephew, indignant that nothing had been left
                    him. Full of vexation, he quickens his pace, and walks so fast that the poor lad
                    cannot keep up with him; upon which he calls out to him with a cross tone,
                    "What! must I bring-to every moment for you, you lazy dog?" his anger
                    thus venting itself on the very person on whose account that anger was excited.
                    Into this novel the author has introduced an account of the expedition to
                    Carthagena, and has given a strong and disgusting picture of the manner of
                    living on board a man of war. It must give pleasure to the reader of the present
                    day to consider how much the attention to health, cleanliness, and
                    accommodation, in respect to our navy, has increased since that account was
                    written. Still, it is probable, nothing can present a more horrible sight than
                    the deck of a man of war after a battle. Many of the characters in these volumes
                    are said to be portraits. Strap the barber, schoolfellow and humble friend of
                    Random, was one Hugh Hewson, whose death was lately announced in the papers.
                    Captain Whiffle was a particular nobleman. Much of the work is filled up with
                    low jokes, and laughable stories, such as, one may suppose, had been circulated
                    in a club over a bottle. Some incidental particulars mark the state of
                    accommodations at that time. Roderick Random comes to London with the <hi rendition="#italics">pack-horses</hi>, there <pb n="vii"/> being then no
                    stage waggon, and the inventory of his goods and linen was very probably <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>'s own.</p>
            <p>Towards the hero of this tale the reader feels little interest; but after he has
                    been led through a variety of adventures, in which he exhibits as little of the
                    amiable qualities as of the more respectable ones, the author, according to the
                    laudable custom of novel-writers, leaves him in possession of a beautiful wife
                    and a good estate.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1750 Dr. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>
                    took a trip to Paris, and laid in a fund for a new display of character in his

                  <hi rendition="#italics">Peregrine Pickle</hi>
               </title>. This is a
                    work even more faulty than the former in its violation of decency and good
                    morals. It has two or three characters of sailors not devoid of humour, though
                    inferior to his first sketch of Tom Bowling. Commodore Trunnion is so rough and
                    bearish, as scarcely to be like any thing human. He is the Caliban of <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>. The wife is still more
                    overcharged. Peregrine himself is a proud, disagreeable, ungrateful boy;
                    vicious, as soon as he could know what vice was, and who had deserved to be
                    hanged long before the end of the first volume. The most entertaining and

                    and other gentlemen, after the manner of the ancients. In this there is humour,
                    and a display of learning, though in the former it is inferior to Scriblerus.<hi rendition="#sup">

            <p>The author has in this work shown his predilection for the party of the <ref target="people.html#CharlesEdwardPrince">Stuart</ref>s, by introducing in a

                    rebellion of 1745, whom Peregrine is supposed to meet at Boulogne, and who go
                    every day to the sea-side to gaze with fond affection on the white cliffs of
                    Britain, which they were never more to behold but at a distance. This Dr. <ref target="people.html#MooreEdward">Moore</ref> mentions as a real incident he
                    was himself witness to, being with <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> at the time. Many strictures on the government and manners of
                    France are introduced into this work; some of them just, but tinged with that
                    prejudice against French manners which he had deeply imbibed, and which showed
                    itself afterwards in his travels.</p>

            <p> It is probable that <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> had
                    been struck with the objections which must have been made to these two novels,
                    that no poetical justice is exercised on the characters; for in his next piece,
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Count Fathom</hi>
               </title>, he has
                    exhibited, as the hero of his piece, a vicious character, who, after going
                    through many scenes of triumphant villany, is detected and punished: but the
                    narration is far from pleasing; knavery is not dignified enough to interest us
                    by its fall. There are more serious characters in this piece, and he has <pb n="ix"/> attempted scenes of tenderness and exalted feeling, but with little
                    success. Strong humour he possessed, but grace and delicacy were foreign to his
                    pencil. He could not draw an interesting female character. But in his own way,
                    the picture of Count Fathom's mother, the follower of a camp, is very
                    striking. It is impossible to contemplate her going about, stripping the dying
                    and the dead, with all the coolness of a mind long hardened by scenes of misery,
                    without a thrill of horror. Count Fathom's adventure in the wood, where he
                    is benighted, and narrowly escapes being murdered by ruffians, is exceedingly
                    well told, and a man must have strong nerves to read it without shuddering.
                    There is less of humour in this than in his two former works; but the story of
                    the sharper, who introduces himself to a gaming-table as a boisterous, ignorant
                    country squire, and takes in the knowing ones, is very amusing.</p>

                    himself as a stranger. She was a woman of strong sense, and a great share of
                    humour, which she retained to the end of life. She did not know him at first;

                    formed to conciliate. It was the means of bringing him into continual quarrels.
                    One of these was with Dr. <ref target="people.html#agraingerJames">Grainger</ref>, whose translation of <hi rendition="#italics">
                  <ref target="people.html#Tibullus">Tibullus</ref>
               </hi> he had reviewed with some acrimony.</p>
            <p> A little before this he had drawn upon himself a prosecution for an assault, in
                    which he had caned a person who had injured him. This chastisement was magnified
                    into an assassination. He was honourably acquitted; but he gave vent to his
                    indignation in a very angry letter to the prosecutor's counsel.</p>
            <p> Another scrape he got into was on account of some strictures in the same Review
                    on the conduct of <ref target="people.html#KnowlesCharles">Admiral
                    Knowles</ref>, on occasion of a pamphlet published by him relative to a secret
                    expedition which had failed. For this he was sentenced to a fine of a hundred
                    pounds and three months imprisonment in the King's Bench. Dr. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> showed he had not
                    forgotten this when he wrote his <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">History of

                    contempt.</p>
            <p> About this time he published another novel, <hi rendition="#italics">The

            <pb n="xi"/>
            <p> While <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> lay in the
                    King's Bench, <ref target="people.html#agarrickDavid">Garrick</ref>
                    generously brought out a farce of his called <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">The
                            Reprisals</hi>
               </title>, on which the author's former animosities
                    against the manager were buried in oblivion; and he tells <ref target="people.html#agarrickDavid"> Garrick</ref> in a letter, that he hopes
                    to have an opportunity of convincing him that his gratitude is at least as warm
                    as any other of his passions.</p>
            <p> As <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> wrote neither for
                    amusement nor for fame, but for subsistence, he soon engaged in another work,
                    which, though hastily composed, had a large sale, namely, <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">A History of England</hi>
               </title>, in four volumes
                    quarto. It was published in the year 1758, and is said to have been composed and
                    finished for the press in fourteen months. Such facility of execution shows
                    powers, but precludes excellence. The narrative is rapid and sprightly, and the
                    characters are drawn with spirit; but it is a hasty work, and strongly tinctured
                    with the political prejudices of the author. It was, however, acceptable to the
                    public, and sold well, because we had at that time no history of credit which
                    came down lower than the Revolution. A Continuation of it was published some
                    years afterwards. In this history, under the head of Arts, he has taken occasion
                    to mention with honour <ref target="people.html#AkensideMark">Akenside</ref> and
                    others whom he had satirized in <title>

               </title>. A high eulogium is also paid to <ref target="people.html#agarrickDavid">Garrick</ref>; and he handsomely told him,
                    that he deemed it incumbent upon him to make a public atonement in a work of
                    truth, for wrongs done him in a work of fiction.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>, having decidedly taken

               </title>. This occasioned the

               </title> of <ref target="people.html#WilkesJohn">Wilkes</ref>, and broke off the friendly
                    intercourse which, as men of literature and genius, they had hitherto held with

            <p>
               <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>'s temper was not well
                    calculated for calmness in such altercations, and the virulence with which he

                  <hi rendition="#italics">The Adventures of an Atom</hi>
               </title>, a

                    end of the last reign and beginning of the present, lost him many of his best
                    friends.</p>
            <p> But his constitution now began to be much broken, and a heavy domestic
                    affliction which fell upon him, the loss of an only daughter, led him to seek
                    relief for himself and his <ref target="people.html#SmollettAnneLassells">wife</ref> in a foreign tour, of which he published an account under the
                    title of <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Letters from France and
                        Italy</hi>
               </title>. They were entertaining, but full of spleen, and they
                    betray those illiberal prejudices against foreigners and foreign manners of
                    which he gave a specimen in <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Peregrine
                            Pickle</hi>
               </title>. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> never possessed the French language sufficiently to converse
                    in it with freedom, and he probably thought he showed his own delicacy by
                    finding fault with the the national usages. Yet whoever reads <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref>'s works, even the
                    least exceptional of them, will be of opinion that he had little title to be
                    fastidious upon the score of delicacy. He was also disappointed in the Pantheon,
                    which he calls <hi rendition="#italics">a huge cock-pit</hi>, and was not
                    enchanted with the Venus de Medicis. These animadversions drew upon him the
                    lively satire of <ref target="people.html#SterneLaurence">Sterne</ref>, who
                    intro- <pb n="xiii"/> duces him in his <title>

                    "The learned Smelfungus," says he, "travelled from Boulogne to
                    Paris, from Paris to Rome, and so on; but he set out with the spleen and
                    jaundice, and every object he passed by was discoloured and distorted. He wrote
                    an account of them, but it was nothing but an account of his miserable feelings.
                    I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon; he was just coming out of
                    it. 'It is nothing but a huge cockpit,' said he. 'I wish you had
                    said nothing worse of the Venus de Medicis,' replied I. He has been flayed

                    he had come at. 'I'll tell it,' said Smelfungus, 'to the

            <p>In 1766, he paid another visit to his native country; but his health was at this
                    time so broken, that he was incapable of enjoying his tour. A fretfulness hung
                    upon him the whole time, which, after his return, he himself noticed to his
                    friends, with much sense of mortification at the peevishness which he could not
                    conquer. He recovered, however, to a certain degree, and, in an interval of
                    tolerable health, wrote the last of his novels, <title>

               </title>. It was indeed the last of his

               <pb n="xiv"/> was advised to try again change of air and climate; but as his
                    circumstances could but ill support the expense of the voyage, his friends
                    applied to the ministry to obtain the office of consul at Leghorn or Nice, by
                    way of sinecure, that he might be free from all care but that of his health; but
                    it could not be obtained: — a repulse not greatly to be wondered at,
                    considering the part he had taken in politics. And indeed, what was there in any
                    of his works to deserve from the public any other remuneration than what his
                    bookseller afforded him? He went abroad, however, having probably obtained the
                    desired assistance through the channel of private friendship, but died at
                    Leghorn in the month of October 1771, in the fifty-first year of his age. His
                        <ref target="people.html#SmollettAnneLassells">wife</ref>, who was with him,
                    erected a plain monument to his memory on the spot, for which his friend Dr.
                        <ref target="people.html#ArmstrongJohn">Armstrong</ref> furnished a Latin
                    inscription, highly complimentary to the deceased, and highly indignant against
                    those who, he imagined, had not sufficiently patronized him. His cousin, <ref target="people.html#SmollettJamesofBonhill">James Smollet</ref> of Bonhill, erected a
                    very elegant pillar to his memory on the banks of the Leven, the stream he had
                    celebrated, and near which he was born, with an appropriate Latin inscription.
                    It is one of the objects which attract the attention of the tourist in the
                    neighbourhood of Dumbarton.</p>
            <p>Dr. <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> was in person stout
                    and well-proportioned. His looks and manners had dignity, with a great mixture
                    of reserve and haughtiness. He had a high independent spirit, and, it is said,
                    would not stoop to flatter those who might have <pb n="xv"/> served him; but how
                    far this was a matter of principle, and how far of temper, may be made a
                    question. A memoir of this author by Dr. <ref target="people.html#MooreJohn">Moore</ref>, his friend and countryman, is prefixed to an edition of his
                    Works, from which the facts in this account are chiefly taken. He concludes his
                    character in these words: "He was of an intrepid, independent, imprudent
                    disposition, equally incapable of deceit and adulation, and more disposed to
                    cultivate the acquaintance of those he could serve, than of those who could
                    serve him."</p>
            <p>As a novel-writer the characteristics of <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> are strong masculine humour, a knowledge of the world,
                    particularly of the vicious part of it, and great force in drawing his
                    characters; but of grace and amenity he had no idea. Neither had he any finesse.
                    He does not know how, like <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>, to insinuate an idea under the mask of a grave irony. He
                    had largely conversed with the world, and travelled, so that his delineations of
                    character and adventures are as different as possible from the effusions of the
                    sentimental theorist. He had certainly vigour of genius, as well as rapidity of
                    execution, but he had none of the finer feelings. To the tender and delicate
                    sensibilities of love he seems to have been a stranger, and he fails whenever he
                    attempts serious and interesting characters. He has little of plot, but deals
                    much in stories of broad mirth, such as that of the man who got at all the
                    secrets of the town by pretending deafness; and his works would afford much
                    pleasant amuse- <pb n="xvi"/> ment, if it were not for the coarseness and
                    vicious manners which pervade them all.</p>
            <p>His mind, either from the vulgar scenes of his early life, or the society of the
                    crew of a man-of-war, seems to have received an indelible taint of vice and
                    impurity. Vice in his works cannot be said to be seductive; for an air of
                    misanthropy pervades all his compositions, and he has scarcely in any of them
                    given us one character to love. It has been said of <ref target="people.html#FieldingHenry">Fielding</ref>, that he could not draw a
                    thoroughly virtuous character; but <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> could not draw an amiable one. It must be remembered,
                    however, that vice may pollute the mind, and coarseness vitiate the taste, even
                    when presented in the least attractive form; and it is therefore to the praise
                    of the present generation that this author's novels are much less read now
                    than they were formerly. The least exceptionable of them is <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Humphrey Clinker</hi>
               </title>, which, that a name
                    of so much celebrity might not be entirely passed over, makes a part of this
                    Selection. It was written at a time when the author's mind was mellowed by
                    age, and cultured society had somewhat softened the coarseness of his painting
                    without destroying his vein of humour. It is the only one of his productions in
                    this line which has not a vicious tendency; but though the <hi rendition="#italics"> moral sense</hi> is not offended in it, the same
                    cannot be said of all the other senses. There is very little of plot in
                            <title>
                  <hi rendition="#italics">Humphrey Clinker</hi>
               </title>. It is
                    carried on in letters, and is rather a frame for remarks on Bath, London,
                    &amp;c. than a regular story. There is a great <pb n="xvii"/> deal of humour,
                    especially in the first volume: the latter part might be entitled with more
                    propriety A Tour into Scotland, and not an unentertaining one, though the
                    nationality of the author is very apparent. The character of Matthew Bramble,
                        <ref target="people.html#SmollettTobias">Smollet</ref> seems to intend for
                    his own. He is represented as a humourist and a misanthrope, with good sense and
                    a feeling heart under his rough husk. His letters are filled with the most
                    caustic strictures upon every thing he sees and hears; the London markets, the
                    rooms and company at Bath and Bristol, the accommodations in travelling; and, in
                    short, every thing he meets with is disgusting till he comes to Scotland —
                    when the scene is changed. He has introduced a whimsical character, Lismahago,
                    into whose mouth he artfully puts an apology for his countrymen more partial
                    than he would have chosen to take upon himself. The letters of Bramble are
                    amusingly contrasted with those of his niece, who sees every thing with the
                    youthful eyes of admiration, and is pleased and happy every where; by which
                    means the author has in a sprightly manner exhibited both sides of the canvass.
                    The reader is often put in mind of <title>

                    several of his remarks and descriptions, and which may also be traced in the
                    humour of the characters. The letters of Tabitha Bramble are very diverting.
                    Winifred is another Slipslop; but her bad spelling grows rather tiresome towards
                    the end. It must be observed that the style of the different personages, all ap-
