                    productions which the efforts of superior genius, or the labours of scholastic
                    industry, have crowded upon the world, none are perused with more insatiable
                    avidity, or disseminated with more universal applause, than the narrations of
                    feigned events, descriptions of imaginary scenes, and deline-<milestone

                    characters. The celebrity of other authors is confined within very narrow
                    limits. The Geometrician and Divine, the Antiquary and Critic, however
                    distinguished by uncontested excellence, can only hope to please those whom a
                    conformity of disposition has engaged in similar pursuits; and must be content
                    to be regarded by the rest of the world with the smile of frigid indifference,
                    or the contemptuous sneer of self-sufficient folly. The collector of shells and
                    the anatomist of insects is little inclined to enter into theological disputes:
                    the Divine is not apt to regard with veneration the uncouth diagrams and tedious
                    calculations of the Astronomer: the man whose life has been consumed in
                    adjusting the disputes of lexicographers, or elucidating the learning of
                    antiquity, cannot easily bend his thoughts to recent transactions, or readily
                    interest himself in the<pb n="41"/>unimportant history of his contemporaries:
                    and the Cit, who knows no business but acquiring wealth, and no pleasure but
                    displaying it, has a heart equally shut up to argument and fancy, to the
                    batteries of syllogism, and the arrows of wit. To the writer of fiction alone,
                    every ear is open, and every tongue lavish of applause; curiosity sparkles in
                    every eye, and every bosom is throbbing with concern.</p>
                <p>I<hi rendition="#smcaps">t</hi> is however easy to account for this enchantment.
                    To follow the chain of perplexed ratiocination, to view with critical skill the
                    airy architecture of systems, to unravel the web of sophistry, or weigh the
                    merits of opposite hypotheses, requires perspicacity, and presupposes learning.
                    Works of this kind, therefore, are not so well adapted to the generality of
                    readers as familiar and colloquial composition;<pb n="42"/>for few can reason,
                    but all can feel; and many who cannot enter into an argument, may yet listen to
                    a tale. The writer of Romance has even an advantage over those who endeavour to
                    amuse by the play of fancy; who from the fortuitous collision of dissimilar
                    ideas produce the scintillations of wit; or by the vivid glow of poetical
                    imagery delight the imagination with colours of ideal radiance. The attraction
                    of the magnet is only exerted upon similar particles; and to taste the beauties
                    of <ref target="people.html#Homer">Homer</ref> it is requisite to partake his
                    fire: but every one can relish the author who represents common life, because
                    every one can refer to the originals from whence his ideas were taken. He
                    relates events to which all are liable, and applies to passions which all have
                    felt. The gloom of solitude, the languor of inaction, the corrosions of
                    disappointment, and the toil of thought, induce men to<pb n="43"/>step aside
                    from the rugged road of life, and wander in the fairy land of fiction; where
                    every bank is sprinkled with flowers, and every gale loaded with perfume; where
                    every event introduces a hero, and every cottage is inhabited by a Grace.
                    Invited by these flattering scenes, the student quits the investigation of
                    truth, in which he perhaps meets with no less fallacy, to exhilerate his mind
                    with new ideas, more agreeable, and more easily attained: the busy relax their
                    attention by desultory reading, and smooth the agitation of a ruffled mind with
                    images of peace, tranquillity, and pleasure: the idle and the gay relieve the
                    listlessness of leisure, and diversify the round of life by a rapid series of
                    events pregnant with rapture and astonishment; and the pensive solitary fills up
                    the vacuities of his heart by interesting himself in the fortunes of imaginary
                    beings, and forming connections with ideal excellence.</p>
                <pb n="44"/>
                <p>I<hi rendition="#smcaps">t</hi> is, indeed, no ways extraordinary that the mind
                    should be charmed by fancy, and attracted by pleasure; but that we should listen
                    to the groans of misery, and delight to view the exacerbations of complicated
                    anguish, that we should chuse to chill the bosom with imaginary fears, and dim
                    the eyes with fictitious sorrow, seems a kind of paradox of the heart, and only
                    to be credited because it is universally felt. Various are the hypotheses which
                    have been formed to account for the disposition of the mind to riot in this
                    species of intellectual luxury. Some have imagined that we are induced to
                    acquiesce with greater patience in our own lot, by beholding pictures of life
                    tinged with deeper horrors, and loaded with more excruciating calamities; as, to
                    a person suddenly emerging out of a dark room, the faintest glimmering of
                    twilight assumes a lustre from the contrasted gloom. O-<pb n="45"/>thers, with
                    yet deeper refinement, suppose that we take upon ourselves this burden of
                    adscititious sorrows in order to feast upon the consciousness of our own virtue.
                    We commiserate others (say they) that we may applaud ourselves; and the sigh of
                    compassionate sympathy is always followed by the gratulations of self-complacent
                    esteem. But surely they who would thus reduce the sympathetic emotions of pity
                    to a system of refined selfishness, have but ill attended to the genuine
                    feelings of humanity. It would however exceed the limits of this paper, should I
                    attempt an accurate investigation of these sentiments. But let it be remembered,
                    that we are more attracted by those scenes which interest our passions, or
                    gratify our curiosity, than those which delight our fancy: and so far from being
                    indifferent to the miseries of others, we are, at the time, totally regardless
                    of our own. And <pb n="46"/>let not those, on whom the hand of time has
                    impressed the characters of oracular wisdom, censure with too much acrimony
                    productions which are thus calculated to please the imagination, and interest
                    the heart. They teach us to think, by inuring us to feel: they ventilate the
                    mind by sudden gusts of passion; and prevent the stagnation of thought, by a
                    fresh infusion of dissimilar ideas.</p>
