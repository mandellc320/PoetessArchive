                    they far more truly belong to one who has had experience of both praise and

                    every author must know: <hi rendition="#italics">now</hi> mine is a
                    &quot;farther looking hope;&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"><note place="foot"><ref

                    and the timidity which apprehended the verdict of others, is now deepened by
                    distrust of my own powers. Or, to claim my poetical privilege, and express my
                    meaning by a simile, I should say, I am no longer one who springs forward in the
                    mere energy of exercise and enjoyment; but rather like the Olympian racer, who
                    strains his utmost vigour, with the distant goal and crown in view. I have
                    devoted my whole life to one object: in society I have but sought the material
                    for solitude. I can imagine but one interest in existence,&#8212;that which has
                    filled my past, and haunts my future,&#8212;the perhaps vain desire, when<pb
                        n="v"/>I am nothing, of leaving one of those memories at once a good and a
                    glory. Believing as I do in the great and excellent influence of poetry, may I
                    hazard the expression of what I have myself sometimes trusted to do? A
                    highly-cultivated state of society must ever have for concomitant evils, that
                    selfishness, the result of indolent indulgence; and that heartlessness attendant
                    on refinement, which too often hardens while it polishes. Aware that to elevate
                    I must first soften, and that if I wished to purify I must first touch, I have
                    ever endeavoured to bring forward grief, disappointment, the fallen leaf, the
                    faded flower, the broken heart, and the early grave. Surely we must be less
                    worldly, less interested, from this sympathy with the<pb n="vi"/>sorrow in which
                    our unselfish feelings alone can take part. And now a few words on a subject,
                    where the variety of the opinions offered have left me somewhat in the situation
                    of the prince in the fairy tale, who, when in the vicinity of the magic
                    fountain, found himself so distracted by the multitude of voices that directed
                    his way, as to be quite incapable of deciding which was the right path. I allude
                    to the blame and eulogy which have been equally bestowed on my frequent choice
                    of Love as my source of song. I can only say, that for a woman, whose influence
                    and whose sphere must be in the affections, what subject can be more fitting
                    than one which it is her peculiar province to refine, spiritualise, and exalt? I
                    have always sought to paint it self-<pb n="vii"/>denying, devoted, and making an
                    almost religion of its truth; and I must add, that such as I would wish to draw
                    her, woman actuated by an attachment as intense as it is true, as pure as it is
                    deep, is not only more admirable as a heroine, but also in actual life, than one
                    whose idea of love is that of light amusement, or at worst of vain
                    mortification. With regard to the frequent application of my works to myself,
                    considering that I sometimes pourtrayed love unrequited, then betrayed, and
                    again destroyed by death&#8212;may I hint the conclusions are not quite
                    logically drawn, as assuredly the same mind cannot have suffered such varied
                    modes of misery. However, if I must have an unhappy passion, I can only console
                    myself with my own perfect unconsciousness of<pb n="viii"/>so great a
                    misfortune. I now leave the following Poems to their fate: they must speak for
                    themselves. I could but express my anxiety, an anxiety only increased by a
                    popularity beyond my most sanguine dreams. </p>
                <p>With regard to those whose former praise encouraged, their best recompense is the
                    happiness they bestowed. And to those whose differing opinion expressed itself
                    in censure, I own, after the first chagrin was past, I never laid down a
                    criticism by which I did not benefit, or trust to benefit. I will conclude by
                    apostrophizing the hopes and fears they excited, in the words of the Mexican
                    king—&quot;Ye have been the feathers of my wings.&quot;<hi rendition="#sup"
